      "Let me start off by saying that I loved this shoe for weeks. I work 12 hour shifts in healthcare at a children’s hospital and I’m always up and walking around, so I thought that these would be a nice lightweight and comfortable shoe to wear. It started out with leg pain here and there but nothing crazy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I worked 3 days in a row, which turned out to be a huge mistake. By the end of the second shift walking to my car and starting into my third shift my foot had oddly started hurting and increasingly grew to the point where I could no longer walk on it. Then on the drive home I started feeling slight back pain and by the time I got home I could hardly walk properly without feeling pain in my back and left foot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would NOT recommend this shoe to anyone who does a lot of walking in their job or stands for hours. I would however recommend this shoe as a day to day choice for running errands as it is super cute and light weight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would also recommend sizing up by at least half a size if not a whole size like I had to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a female, I run five miles every morning, and I have recently been plagued with mild to medium metatarsalgia (ball of foot pain) wearing my old ASICS Gel Trabuco Trail Running shoes. I read that these Asics Gel-Venture 7 trail running shoes are supposed to be highly cushioned and useful in stemming metatarsal pain. So, I ordered a pair and have been running in them every morning for the past nineteen days. They started off rather stiff and it took me a few days to get just the right sock combination. I have narrow feet and am a senior, so my feet are bonier than they were in my youth. I also still use an additional metatarsal gel pad since the balls of my feet hurt just a bit (but not nearly as much as they did in my older shoes) without the additional pads.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now these shoes feel perfectly comfortable and I am loath to take them off after my daily run. I highly recommend this Asics model and have since ordered a second pair as backup. I do not want to be caught without a pair waiting for whenever these wear out (that I assume will be a long time from now based on my other previous and current Asics running and walking shoes). Numerous color choices too. I usually wear 7.5 N shoes, but the 7.5.M work just fine since I know that I generally use a double-layer running sock and the metatarsal gel pads.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I highly recommend this running shoe!\n",
      "\n",
      "Super comfy! The style is great and they can definitely be worn all day no problem. My only gripe is that they fit a little small length wise. They were too small with thin socks on, without socks they are fine but still slightly tight. Nothing too terrible though. I bought a 10 as I usually do, maybe a 10.5 would have been better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "UPDATE: I don't wear socks with these, and I'm on my feet for 8+ hours at work. These are the best! My ankles don't hurt at the end of the day, and they are super lightweight, I forget I'm wearing them! I can't recommend these enough!!!! Will be buying again!\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: I still love my cloud foams. However due to my increasingly demanding clinical site work, I’ve upgraded my shoes to the Adidas Ultraboost 19. My school requires white shoes (I’ve been able to get away with the pale blue Cloud foams because like Shawshank Redemption, people tend to not look at other’s shoes). The Ultraboost are considerably more at about $180 MSRP. But they come with a ton more springiness and you can tell you are getting much more in a shoe. They are very forgiving to feet that swell over a long day so I recommend to try those if you’re in the market for something nicer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Side note: I hear Nike is coming out with a shoe line specifically geared towards healthcare workers and shift work. Excited to give those a shot down the line but for now I am happy wearing both my cloud foams and ultraboosts\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sizing.. not sure how my feet shrank over the last 20 years but they have gone down from. 7.5-8 to a 5.5. Pretty soon i’ll be wearing baby shoes. In these particular shoes for my feet (knowing it varies for people) I’d say they’re a good fit maybe slightly roomy which works well since I wear thick compression socks since I am in nursing school. The 10-12 hours in the hospital make it so my feet swell. So I would recommend getting your normal size.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have these shoes in both grey and pale blue. Although I agree “cloud foam” makes it sound like you’re stepping onto a memory foam mattress and it enveloping and caressing your tired feet.. it has much less padding than anticipated. However, these are THE most comfortable shoes I have owned in quite some time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have several pairs of Nike Free which are also comfy in their own right but I am finding my feet are getting slightly wider as I age (yay) I am in my 30’s if that helps any reader.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The huge plus in these are that the raised and padded heel makes it so I never ever get blisters there. And i always get blisters there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only thing i’m not crazy about is the tongue portion. The top of it hits the same area of my foot so I can’t sport ankle socks. It’s ok for me since I am always wearing them in scrubs under long pants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I’ve worn my grey pair on 4 hour hikes, 8 hours in an amusement park and every time these do not make me feel like I have bound feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The price for a big name brand is really reasonable at $55. I typically expect to spen $100+\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like the memory foam insole to these shoes. It's very comfortable. I will say that after a couple of weeks it has compressed quite a bit, however. I ordered 12 Wide sized shoes, and they fit a bit loosely, but then I did add my own orthopedic support to the shoes below the memory foam insole, which was easily removable, in order to support my metatarsalgia. This created a tighter fit and has resulted in a supremely comfortable, lightweight shoe. I walk about 3-4 miles a day, and they've held up pretty well. I love that they're basically slip-on shoes, but have laces to tighten the front as needed. I can't wear no-show socks with these shoes as the heel comes up and rubs on my achilles tendon, but a low-cut sock still works. I even got caught in a downpour and my shoes were soaked to the point of squelching. They dried out within hours, after I took out the insoles. My only real complaint is that they're not super breathable. When I come back from my walks, my feet are VERY hot. Still, I'm considering getting another pair. I definitely recommend this shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought these shoes back in March for work. They didn't really need \"breaking in\" like some of my previous shoes.\r\n",
      "I have back problems and I figured a new pair of shoes with some good support would benefit me in the long run considering how much walking/hiking I do.\r\n",
      "These shoes have been absolutely wonderful.\r\n",
      "But THEY DON'T BREATHE.\r\n",
      "I have never had problems with foot odor until I got these shoes.\r\n",
      "I wore them for two 8 hour shifts and the smell started they're so comfy that I've been stuffing dryer sheets in them to keep the smell from being so bad.\r\n",
      "For the people like \"well you need to wear socks\"\r\n",
      "I do. Fresh clean socks every single time.\r\n",
      "I'm on my feet majority of the day.\r\n",
      "These shoes fit the comfort and support but if you expect to be running around all day in them, plan on doing a foot soak and leaving the shoes at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am on my feet at work for 8-12 hours a day. Standing, walking, running, up and down stairs.. my feet don't rest until I get home. I really thought, after reading reviews, that these were THE shoes for all day wear. Unfortunately, they are not. They feel great for the first hour or so.. but by 2 hours in, you are already begging to take them off.\r\n",
      "Not only do my feet kill me, my ankles are sore, my calves cramp up, my knees hurt more than I've ever experienced before, and even my hips feel out of line. I get more comfort out of wearing heeled booties for days in a row. These shoes are terrible. I wore them for a few months to see if breaking them in would help, and it didn't. These shoes have caused nothing but foot/leg pain.\r\n",
      "Don't waste your money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like walking on a cloud! I now have 3 pairs of these tennis shoes in different colors and I love them. Very comfortable and also stylish. They have a low profile, so they're pretty cute, as well. I wear them to work every day (work in a hospital and I stand quite a bit) and I can also wear them as casual/cute sneaks. The padding inside is seriously so comfy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One thing to note is I don't think they are the best work-out tennis shoes ever. I like something a little bit bigger and higher profile for heavy weightlifting or long runs. But I love them for work and wearing around town, as stated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, highly recommend\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t believe how much these shoes helped me. I work retail and I stand on concrete floors all day every day. I used to wear adidas with a foam insert, but I’d still come home unable to walk around my house because my feet hurt so badly. I saw some good reviews for these and decided to try them. I can’t believe how much better my feet feel. I still have bad days but it’s not near as often as before. I’m able to be on my feet all day, 40 hours a week, without crippling pain. I also noticed that my sciatic nerve in my back has been bothering me a lot less. I can’t recommend this shoe enough for anyone who has pain from working retail. I feel so much better!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "These shoes fit as expected. They are very comfortable and very lightweight. Brand new, they were very stylish. I really enjoyed the shoes. That being said,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I bought these for work. I'm in IT and our floors are concrete. If I walk in the city for lunch, it's less than 1mile a day on sidewalk, if at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After about 5 months of daily semi-daily wear to work (where I mostly sit down), the tread on the bottom of these shoes disappeared. The lightweight effect is a trade-off for durable tread.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nike's shoes made for walking/running never did this to me (except for long distance hikes for 1-2 years). I was walking on the sidewalk a morning after rain the night before and fell flat on my ass! The tread is mostly worn off the in the parts where there is 0 visible remaining tread, there are actually divers which I believe are capable of growing into actual holes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I liked the shoes, but considering I didn't put a lot of miles on them, I would have liked to get more than 5 months for a $60 pair of shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was looking for a shoe I could wear on some upcoming trips where I know I will be walking a lot. Wanted it to be cute, not too bulky, easy to take on/off at airport, and comfortable enough to wear all day / 5-8 miles a day. I think these should work great - they are really comfortable, fit as expected and are cute sneakers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That being said, if you are looking at these as potential running shoes I would not recommend. They are really lightweight and don't have anything that would lessen impact (the memory foam is very thin). You will definitely feel the ground with every step. As a runner, I just can't imagine wearing them for more than 2-3 miles without regretting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work 8 hours a day 5 days a week, walking, moving doing things. After  5 months holes happened in the toe of the show and before they started to hurt my feet.  So would be good for part time wear not every day wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I usually hate sneakers, and this is finally a pair I like! I've had these shoes for a few months and I think they're an incredible deal. They're comfy and stylish. Great for everyday wear and exercising. I was worried that the soles wouldn't be supportive enough, but they work great for me (I work out and walk in them every day and run sometimes, but am not a runner--I think serious runners probably should not and would not use these as running shoes). I got these after my physical therapist recommended them--they looked great on her and she wore them to work and said they stayed comfy all day. The one thing to keep in mind is that I think the soles will wear out after a year or so of heavy use--which is normal, especially at this price point. Mine are already starting to wear out, so I could see buying a new pair in about a year. And I will definitely be buying a new pair of the exact same ones!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dude, I bought these to work out, which I haven't really gotten around to yet, but I'd ordered another pair of dress shoes along with them, and I walk quite a bit, so they made my heels hurt, and I got shin splints. So I decided to wear these for a more casual occasion, and they are so comfortable! I'd been wearing dress shoes for like two years straight, walking miles a day, and these made such a difference. They're also pretty cute! I work at a hotel, and they didn't seem too out of place with my uniform, and I've gotten a lot of compliments!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm very glad that I bought these shoes. I first got the red ones at Dick's Sporting Goods on clearance when I was just looking for some casual tennis shoes. But I also needed new shoes for work - I'm a 25 year old woman in a *casual* business casual office setting. My main concern was comfort, so I got on Amazon and found the same shoes in black / gray. I usually wear black leggings, a nice shirt, and a cardigan sweater to work and these black shoes go great with it. One of the middle-aged men at my company complimented me on them and seemed sincere. Then one of my female coworkers around my age took the time during a meeting to instant message me and tell me that they were \"fresh AF\", and they were the first thing she noticed when she walked into the meeting. So nice to hear things like this! They're very comfortable and fit well. I wear a size 7 in most shoes. I've been wearing the black ones every work day for a couple weeks and not much visible wear on them so far. I usually wear liner socks with these to work at least because the sides do come down far, but it looks good in my opinion...always liked the \"low pro\" look :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Love these shoes! Especially for the price. I wanted plain black shoes with a white sole that are a real brand but didn’t want to pay $80 to $100. These were $50 and are perfect. Love that they’re neoprene (I think?) around the ankle so they slip on without having to be untied. The back part of the ones I got is actually kind of really dark blue (or a weird gray?) instead of black. I’d have preferred all the same black but I didn’t even notice until I had been wearing them for a month so it doesn’t really matter. I originally got an 8 1/2 and had to send them back for a 9, but that’s my bad. I wear both and lately it seems I get 9s more often. Sometimes I think I should have gotten a 9 1/2 so maybe they’re a little narrow. But they’re still super comfortable and I wear them to walk a few miles 3-4 days a week and for everything else I do while stuck at home due to covid. I’ve had them a couple of months and they’re holding up well. Highly recommend!\n",
      "\n",
      "These shoes are SO comfortable! I normally wear a 6.5/7 among all my different style of shoes and have these in a size 7 and they fit perfectly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These shoes have an easily maneuverable fabric around the whole shoe which follow into a very secure rubber like base/sole. The base of this shoe is very lightweight - actually the entire shoe is very light. The inside is like a squishy gel like padding - super comfy! I wore these all day for work (standing and walking for 8 hours) and my feet didn’t hurt! Even after work with some light jogging - no blisters and my feet felt great!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I am super impressed with these shoes and they’re a first for me from this brand - very satisfied 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻\n",
      "\n",
      "Love these! Very comfy and so cute! , I stand all day at work and these feel supportive and comfy! They do run slightly smaller, I was worried when I first tried them on but after wearing a few times they feel fine? It helps to wear a thinner no show sock!\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought these for a hiking trip in Sedona and was not disappointed! I averaged 15-20 miles a day and my feet felt great. I am a nurse and everyone at work wears them so I thought I would try them. I stand for long periods and work 12 hour shifts and they are great. They do run a little tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not a fan of memory foam, but these are very comfortable shoes.  If you buy your size, you will need to wear thin socks.  If you are a thick sock person, get a half size up.  I walk/run 3.1 miles at least 3+ times a week outside.  These shoes are not made for that!  I will use these shoes for days I dress casual at work only. Other than that, they are extremely lightweight and I love the look of them.  I wish I would of bought a half size up since I know now that they will not be my running shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get many compliments on these shoes, and they match well (the gray/black)! They felt super-comfy at  first but after a short while of walking they become not too comfortable. Tried wearing on concrete floors to work and walk all day...not a chance for me. Small amount of arch support, but they do even slide on well and the soles are VERY flexible, so that part makes them comfortable for me.\r\n",
      "Sizing - my usual size 6 was a little tight for me, but 6.5 runs a little loose but not sloppy. I've continued to wear them.\r\n",
      "If the insole was improved, I would definitely purchase again, but not at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So these shoes look really nice, but they do not work well if you are going for long walks or if you (as I bought them for) want to go running. They are terrible running shoes. The lack of arch support and thin padding makes it feel like you are running on a flat rock. Walked around in Vegas with them, and they were fine, but again because the lack of padding they feel like rocks after about an hour. Also the tread is almost gone on mine and I only bought them a few months ago. But I still wear them when I stand and cashier for eight hours a day, and they work just fine, and again they look nice and are easy to slip on and off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m really happy with these shoes! I ordered both my true size (9.5) and a half size up (10) as the reviews suggested, and I ended up keeping the 10s. They are nice and roomy in the “toe box” and I’m guessing these would be great if you had wide feet or a bunion. I have normal width feet and they fit great also. Super cute for walking to work or going to the gym. I wore them to a music festival all weekend and they were comfy all day and the light grey didn’t show dirt. I don’t think they have enough support/cushion for long distance running, but I only walk, lift, and bike in them so it’s fine. They are slip on without looking like it and they’re trendy enough that I feel like I can wear them with real clothes. Very happy :) would recommend\n",
      "\n",
      "I waited almost a year to write this review, as I like to have time to try it out.\r\n",
      "These shoes are awful. After two months, the soles were starting to wear down completely, the “cloud foam” became non-existent, my left pinky is bust in’ out(which started three months ago) & i should have sent them back when I noticed the right upper toe didn’t appear to be “attached” completely(see third picture).\r\n",
      "I wore these shoes 3-4 days a week, for my twelve hour work shifts & demoted them to yard work shoes.\r\n",
      "My previous shoes I had for six years & never had this issue, not even a single hole! As far as I’m concerned Adidas these are the worst pair of shoes you’ve EVER made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Adidas Cloudfoam Pure Running Shoes are shoes meant for any age and any activity. They can be worn for running, weight lifting, other exercising, or just as everyday shoes; however, I purchased them for everyday wear. I am a college student who walks to class every day. These shoes have been perfect for that. My feet have not hurt one bit. I chose the black and white speckled colored ones to accommodate for comfortable, lazy-day outfits, or cute outfits with jeans! Neutrals are always a go-to in my opinion, because I am definitely one to want to get as much use out of a product as possible. This shoe wipes clean and doesn’t stain which is amazing! I was worried living in Iowa, with heavy snow and rain, that the shoe would be destroyed quite quickly. I was surprised to see how easily they wipe clean.\r\n",
      "The Cloudfoam midsole and outsole are combined for step-in comfort and superior cushioning and the sock liner molds to hug the foot as well for extra support. I personally like the high ankle as it gives more stability. The Cloudfoam pure running shoes are super comfortable and lightweight and the fabric is a very breathable mesh. I appreciate that my feet do not sweat when I wear these shoes because of how breathable they are. I love the slick and clean look and that it feels like I am running on air, yet have plenty of support. They are super cute and come exactly as pictured.\r\n",
      "The shoes seem to run a half-size big, so I would keep that in mind when purchasing or prepare to wear a little bit of a thicker sock and/or purchase an insole for the shoes. These shoes are more of a slip on shoe. There are laces on the shoe, but there is no tongue, so slipping the shoe on and off can be done quite easily. With that being said, you can pull the laces a little tighter if needed.\r\n",
      "I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a good tennis shoe, hence why I rated these shoes four out of five stars! I am quite happy with my purchase and cannot wait to continue to get use out of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered these shoes in my normal size which is 7 wide and wish I ordered a 7 1/2 wide instead. I work long 12 hour shifts and I’m constantly on my feet and barely have time to sit, my toes are too cramped inside. I got these shoes, hoping they would be my go-to shoes for work, but after wearing them for a few days, I cannot bear the pain anymore. I really wanted to like these shoes based on the reviews but will have to find another pair of shoes to wear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "P.S. - The price significantly dropped a couple days after I purchased them, which is also a bummer!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was excited ti get these shoes and was quickly disappointed. I got them in a 9.5 wide due to having a bunion on one foot. When first opening the box, they looked somewhat small. I tried them on and they fit fine. Well, I wore them the next day to work and it was not good. You have to either wear no socks or extremely thin socks for them to not fit too tight. They did not fit like other 9.5 shoes that I have. Even if I got a size 10 I don't believe they would fit better. The shoe says it has memory foam in it, but not enough. After wearing these shoes for 7 hours at work, my entire toenail in my big toe hurts. These will more than likely go in the trash.\n",
      "\n",
      "These shoes came through I work for amazon and on my feet for at least 11 hours a day.  Feet feel so much better with these shoes.  But I also wear compression socks. The combination is magic.  I love these shoes.  And they don’t look to bad either being that I’m a shoe fan. Forget looking cute. My feet where killing me.  I wanted to quit on many occasions cause the pain was so bad. But now I’m walking on clouds. Definitely a must buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought these a little over 2 months ago for me to wear to work. I love how these shoes fit and the comfort wearing them for 8 to 9 hours a day. My only issue is the threading at the toe is already coming apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased these to wear for work. I work on my feet on concrete floors 6 hours a day 5 days a week. The shoes were great to start, fit well and were comfortable but didn't last long. I just ordered a replacement yesterday, meaning these lasted just a little less than 3 months. They're not falling apart, just don't support my feet anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work as an RN in a very busy ICU and usually wear athletic shoes in favor of crocs or clogs. I often work 4-5 days in a row between two jobs and am on my feet a lot, needless to say. My last pair of shoes were new balance and they lasted almost a year and were very supportive. I’ve worn this pair of shoes three times and I am already shopping for a new pair. If you’re looking for shoes with good support that will allow you to be on your feet either standing or walking for hours at a time, these shoes are not for you. If you want something light weight and flexible on days where you’re not going to be too active, I guess they’d be alright. For me, they were a nightmare and my feet are in horrible pain. I’m not sure how other reviewers said they could wear these comfortably with plantar fasciitis because I’m pretty sure they’ve caused me to have plantar fasciitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought a pair for work since I'd be on my feet a lot. I usually wear size 8.5, so that's what I ordered. I got them and tried them on the same day. I noticed it was tight, but I figured they needed to be broken in. I wore it to work the next day and by the end of the day the top of my feet were sore and aching. I'd loosen the laces throughout the day, but they would tighten back up making my feet hurt. I ended up returning them as soon as I got home. I'd size up either half a size or a whole size. Aside from it being too small, it did feel comfortable. The soles of my feet didn't hurt because of the extra cushion and memory foam that they have in it. I would recommend the shoes, just a bigger size.\n",
      "\n",
      "These shoes are my go-to shoes. I slip them on if I'm going for a walk, or if I just have to run outside to my car. They are super comfy and stylish. I don't think that would be very supportive for intense work outs, but they are great for every day wear. Will definitely purchase again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased these shoes for work. I typically wear Nursemates as I am on my feet 8+ hours a day. I have a wider foot, wear a size 8 which is what I ordered in regular width, and find it difficult to find shoes that I can wear on day 1 and feel comfortable in. These were perfect, no blisters no issues, decent non slip. I have been wearing them for a week and am very happy with my purchase\n",
      "\n",
      "Super comfortable, I wear them to work every single day and I’m always on my feet. Just got a another job where I have to wear white shoes so I just bought another in white. I definitely recommend, doubt this is a purchase you’d regret they’re cute and practical. That’s why I now have two pairs lol\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought these shoes for casual, comfy days.  Do I plan on running in these?  No.  In all fairness, I probably wouldn’t run in any shoes (unless I was being chased by a predator or running for the last bar of chocolate on earth).  These shoes were instantly comfortable. I wear a 9-9.5.  The ball part of my foot is med to wide; the heel of my foot is narrow. These work great.  I ordered 9.5 and these are true to size. They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width. I can tied the securely so the heel fits. I love the cushy memory foam. I plan on wearing these at Disney, they are that comfortable.  They look pretty good. If I survive walking 5-10 miles at Disney, I will come back and update my post Disney experience. If I don’t survive, it probably was no fault of these shoes. I’d say one too many ice creams or getting into deadly fight triggered by one too many renditions of “It’s a Small World.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely not a shoe id want to wear every day, which is what I have to do at work for 12 hours (I have to have straight black shoes, so slim picking). Very uncomfortable. I usually go with adidas & took my shot with this brand. Lesson learned!\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought a pair a few weeks ago, liked them so much, I bought a second pair, so I can switch off every day. They are very light and fit like a thick snug sock! I'm 70 and walk 2+ miles a day with my dogs. I think it's the heel drop design  that works for me. No intermittent shooting pains in my feet, legs, hips. I wear them all day, not just for walking.  The price was right and, like my granddaughters said...they're cute!\n",
      "\n",
      "I do like this shoe a lot.  I can wear it most of the day before my \"bunion\" foot starts to ache.  My bunion is a little worse than average and I can still wear it so that's a big plus.  I usually wear a sz 9.5 in my walking shoes and that's what I got and it works.  It's a very comfortable shoe.  I highly recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work in retail and stand/walk for 8-hour shifts. I tried all kinds of shoes (including other Nikes) and different shoe inserts to help ease the pain in my feet at the end of the day. These shoes feel like like walking on a cloud! My feet don’t hurt at the end of the day, and I don’t  have to wear ugly orthopedic shoes. These are great looking and functional. If you have foot pain like I do from being on your feet all day, BUY THESE SHOES.\n",
      "\n",
      "So comfy. I wear these to work and I'm an occupational therapist, on my feet a lot. Wore them 15 hours the first day without a problem!\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought these for cute work out shoes but then brought them to wear after work one day and OMG. these are the most comfortable shoe to put on. I have plantar fasciitis but am also a server. So by the end of shifts sometimes my feet hurt so bad. I even have dr.schols work shoes but OMG putting these on after was heaven. And they are hella cute! I want all the colors\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm on my feet 12+ hours a day and these are my go-to shoes for work. Being on my feet and walking around on concrete floors, these have been the most comfortable shoe to wear without having to put in an insert.  I've worn Nike, Adidas and Reebok among others and hands down, Asics are the best for comfort on your feet all day and they're decently priced!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the look of this shoe. I put on the first day and wore to work for 8 hours. No break in period, they were fine all day. Usually sport shoes are too hot for me but these were fine. I normally wear a 9 and these are 9’s...\n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE these shoes. I wear them a few times a week to work or running errands on the weekend. I run a preschool and spend most of my day on my feet and like to take a 2 mile walk on my lunch break. I needed a pair of sneakers that wouldn’t look too casual or too sporty. I have owned a few pair of New Balance shoes over the years and have loved them all. These look nice with jeans, black jeggings or leggings on the weekend. They aren’t the most supportive and I don’t see them lasting forever, but the price price point and style were perfect. I will be purchasing another pair (in a different color) and when they wear out, I will most likely purchase again.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are stylish & very cushioned. I bought them to wear for long days at work (Nurse). There was no break in period & I wore them for a 14 hour workday the first time I put them on.\r\n",
      "I ordered a half size up (6.5) as my experience with Adidas is they run small. A 6 would have fit perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think these are my third or fourth pair of this model from Asics.  I don't use them for running, but because they're so comfy at work.  I'm on my feet and moving all day, and I have feet that are right on the border where a lot of shoes are too tight, but wide widths are often a smidge too wide.  These just hit the right mark for me.  I switch out to a new pair about every six months for work. They last longer than that, and I keep them for non-work use, but that's usually around the point where I want a new pair for all day wear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing I like about them is that although they're not waterproof, they do dry out pretty quickly if I get them wet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved the look of this shoe, but not as cushy as expected. On a scale of 1 to 10 regarding style, I would say a 10. On a scale of 1 to 10 on comfort, I would say a 7 (average comfort). The shoe is extremely lightweight and has a thin layer of foam which was hardly noticeable in the ball of the foot. This could be seen as an pro as a light weight shoe for traveling or casual wear.  I bought these hoping for a cushy running shoe, but did not use for running because the padding was so thin on the sole compared to my Nikes and Brooks.  Heel did have padding, but still very light on the padding compared to a traditional “running shoe.” Ball of foot and toe area, little padding.  I run anywhere between 1.5-4 miles 3-5 times per week and will also walk 1-2 miles on other days. The shoe provided more than adequate comfort for walking several miles and did well while walking miles upon miles in Europe. I did not have sore feet! So style was perfect, but comfort for any running activity beyond extensive walking may require a more heavily padded shoe especially if you desire arch support. I did use with arch supports in Europe and found the shoe to be a complete success in meeting my needs for 50miles if walking in 5 days. Again, shoe held up for miles of walking and was comfortable with arch support inserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased these shoes solely (haha pun not intended) to wear around the house. I almost completely stopped wearing shoes in 2020 - because who leaves the house these days? My feet were getting really beat up walking around on hard floors all day, so I decided to get a new pair of shoes that I would wear exclusively indoors. The brand I usually order was no longer available on Amazon, so I tried these on a whim. They are well-made, matched the description, cute, and do the trick. The length of the shoe is accurate as is the width of the heel, but the toe area (width) is very tight (not exactly comfortable). I'm fine wearing them to walk around at home, but if I had purchased them for exercising or going out and about, they would probably be too uncomfortable, bordering on painful. I'm still giving these a 3 (which I consider a good score, just not great or excellent) because of that. They are size wide, so that shouldn't have been an issue. But I also realize my feet may have changed more than I realized during my year of no shoes. If width isn't an issue for the upper half of your feet, then I'm sure they'll work great and you'll love them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had these shoes for a few months now, and they're very comfortable for casual wear. I like the way they look, they're easy to slip on, and my feet never hurt wearing them. However, I did get into the habit of walking about 6 miles a day recently, and I've worn these shoes for over 300 miles of walking. It's gotten to the point where I've realized they're not meant for this, because my feet will often hurt afterwards, and the insoles don't have the spring they used to. I would not recommend them for extended wear or exercise. But if you're looking for something comfy to just wear around and not run or walk seriously in, these are great.\n",

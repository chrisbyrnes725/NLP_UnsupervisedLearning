Adidas,5,Great shoes! Exercise in everyday
Adidas,5,...Extremely Comfortable...
Adidas,5,"...that will make you wanna go and write a review even if you are incredibly lazy when it comes to writing reviews for anything. This shoes are that good. Seriously. Super soft feel to the foot, very comfortable, true to the size and truly the running shoes I have ever had! 5/5"
Adidas,5,❤️it! 🥰 Excellent 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 A+++
Adidas,5,"0.73lbs (or 329g) shoes that fit like marshmallows.
I usually wear anywhere between 7.5-8.5 depending and 7.5 fit the best.
It fits almost like slip ons."
Adidas,5,10/10 best shoes ever! Would buy again when these wear out.
Adidas,5,100% recommend these shoes. The fit and comfort is spot on I have slender narrow feet with high falling arches. If I dont have the right arch support on my feet my high arch muscle will try to detach pretty much and it super painful and very hard to find I perfect fitting shoe!... these are PERFECT!!!!
Adidas,5,"100% would recommend for style but for workout, probably not. As others have said, the bottom gets dirty and worn out."
Adidas,5,2nd pair! Great for running 3-8 miles. Very cushiony
Adidas,5,2nd pair.. love them so much. Very comfy and very lightweight!
Adidas,5,A bit larger than expected around the ankle so I definitely wouldn’t get these to work out but they are cute every day go shopping shoes.
Adidas,5,A bit larger than normal for my other adidas. But really soft and comfortable.  Very nice colors.
Adidas,5,"A bit too stretchy for workouts, but great for a long day wear sneaker!"
Adidas,5,A Christmas present for our Granddaughter. She loved them
Adidas,5,a co-worker ordered these and i love them. order 8.5 which is my regular size and they fit perfectly. they are very comfortable and lightweight.  will def order other colors.

Adidas,5,"A gift, well appreciated tho"
Adidas,5,A good support shoe for work!  Light and comfortable.
Adidas,5,"A great every day shoe! I wore them through the airport for hours and they were light and comfortable. I haven't exercised in them, but they work great for running errands or walking the dog. I am normally a size 7 or 7.5 and the 7 was perfect. If you're unsure about size, there's a more detailed size chart on the Adidas website that worked perfectly!"
Adidas,5,"A great looking sneaker! It could use a little more arch support, but very comfortable."
Adidas,5,A little big but it’s ok
Adidas,5,A little big but so soft and comfy.
Adidas,5,A little bit over my usual 8.5...i think this may be a 9 but still comfy n durable..
Adidas,5,A little bit too big- I’m a 7 1/2 and they fit more like an 8 - but great shoe anyway
Adidas,5,"A little large but very comfortable shoe, I wear them for work on my feet all day at a Hospital."
Adidas,5,A little wide
Adidas,5,A really comfortable and easy running shoe. The tabs help you slip them on with ease.
Adidas,5,A very comfortable insole! Shoe fits true to size. The shoes are very fashionable for a cute athletic look! The back has a longer heel covering so it’s easy to slide these sneakers on. I also found I didn’t have to break in these sneakers and go through a painful blister stage with my feet.
Adidas,5,A very lightweight running sneaker. Comfortable and easy to put on. I'm a casual runner so these are perfect for me.
Adidas,5,"A+++  After reading other reviews, I decided to order a size 8 (I normally wear a size 7.5/8) and they fit perfectly. The color was a bit different than the pictures; more whitish than grey, but I absolutely love them. They're light, airy, and very comfortable. I get a lot of compliments about these shoes-  PLUS, they're  very easy to clean."
Adidas,5,Absolutely adore these! The style/design is so cute!
Adidas,5,"Absolutely amazing, literally feels like you’re walking on a cloud. Im willing buy every color now.
And very comfortable and lightweight"
Adidas,5,"Absolutely beautiful! Perfect and comfortable.
Update: the cloud foam is not as sturdy as I would have liked. I notice the soles seems to squish down after about 2 miles of walking whether it be on the treadmill or out and about."
Adidas,5,Absolutely comfortable I would recommend anybody and everybody to buy these shoes
Adidas,5,Absolutely incredible comfortable and  light. In our ophthalmology office we run for 8 hours straight with patients. This is the first pair of shoes in 14 years of my career that I have not complained about my feet when I come home.
Adidas,5,absolutely love them ...i was lm a cruise and wore these instyof sandles
Adidas,5,"Absolutely love them! I am a hair stylist and mom and stand for hours at a time! These are the lightest sneakers I’ve ever own, but with sole support. I tell everyone that the cushion around ankle is like a VS padded bra!"
Adidas,5,Absolutely love them. As I nurse I'm 9n mu feet most of the day...instant favorite  gonna buy a 2nd pair!!
Adidas,5,Absolutely love these
Adidas,5,"Absolutely love these Adidas shoes, ordered a 7 1/2 and fit was perfect, love that they just slip on and off, as I’m disabled, they are so comfortable and super cute!"
Adidas,5,Absolutely love these shoes for long days at work! Super comfortable and lightweight. I have worked out a few times in these but I’d rather a shoe with more support but over all these are fantastic!
Adidas,5,Absolutely LOVE these shoes! I keep ordering them because their durable and stylish. Easy to clean and work well with my bad arches too
Adidas,5,"Absolutely love these shoes! This is my second pair, and I wear them every chance I get! They’re lightweight, the fabric breathes, and the insole is so soft and comfy."
Adidas,5,"Absolutely love these shoes. I am a size 6 and they fit perfectly. I am a nurse and I am on my feet five days a week and with these on, my feet don’t get tired. Get these don’t think about it."
Adidas,5,Absolutely love these shoes. They are so comfortable and I want every color now!
Adidas,5,Absolutely love these sneakers...you feel like you're walking on air! My new FAVS!!!
Adidas,5,Absolutely love these tennis shoes.. very comfy! Don’t tell my husband but this is my 3rd pair.  Pair to wear around the house..pair to wear out and a pair for work. I love them. I highly recommend these shoes
Adidas,5,Absolutely love these! Cloudfoam gets me through my 12hr shifts in the ER with NO foot or back pain.
Adidas,5,"Absolutely love these! I was a bit hesitant after reading some reviews but so glad I got them. Now, I’m not a runner. But I do go to the gym and these are awesome for working out like I do (lifting/strength training followed by cardio). Great support and comfort. This product fits just fine for me. I go between a 10 and 11 so I got the 11 and have room to spare but nothing crazy that would affect the support/comfort. Great color and feel nice on!"
Adidas,5,Absolutely love these. If you have a narrow foot size a half size down.
Adidas,5,Absolutely love these. So comfortable and light weight.
Adidas,5,"Absolutely LOVE these. They’re beyond comfortable, super lightweight, and the all-white ones that I bought look super fresh.
Only downfall is how easily they stain (being all-white). The material is difficult to rub stain out of (even with Clorox and a typical stain remover, such as SHOUT). I wish the material was more “stain resistant” so that stains would rub out more easily. Despite this, the shoes are ideal for use during HIIT workouts and running 2-3 miles outdoors. Very happy and will purchase again."
Adidas,5,Absolutely satisfied. They fit perfectly. Feel like I am walking on air. Sometimes  I have to look down to see if I am wearing shoes. Soooo light.
Adidas,5,Absolutely the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. They do run one size too big. I’m usually a 6.5 - wearing a 6 and still a bit big. But still super comfortable and love the look!
Adidas,5,Absolutely wonderful shoe!  Very comfortable but don't forget to order 1/2 size larger!  Besides that I love them!
Adidas,5,Actually a super comfortable shoe! Nice fit and lightweight
Adidas,5,Actually got for my daughter but fit me so they do run a little big
Adidas,5,Adidas  cloudfoam pure are my favorite shoes. The donrun about a 1/2 size big compared to other athletic brands.
Adidas,5,Adidas Cloudfoam are the best! This is my second pair and I love them!
Adidas,5,Adidas es la mejor marca me encantaron estas zapatillas justo lo que quería
Adidas,5,"Adidas has hit the jackpot with the cloudfoam shoes. I have always had issues with tennis shoes and rubbing the bottom of my feet, these are perfect. Highly recommended."
Adidas,5,Adidas is my favorite and these are some of my favorite tennis shoes! So cute and comfortable! They have a memory foam in them. I would say these are probably not some you want to run in or stand in all day but they are perfect for going to the gym in!
Adidas,5,Adidas makes a perfect shoe... again! These replaced my first pair of cloud foams that had lasted more than 3 years of near-daily use.  So comfortable and light you forget you have shoes on. I get compliments on the color all the time!
Adidas,5,"Adidas memory foam sneakers are my absolute favorite for everyday wear. I doubt these would be supportive enough for running, but they’re great for walking and day-to-day use. I walked probably 10+ miles over two days wearing these shoes right out of the box with no break-in, and they felt great. My only complaint is that they don’t seem to last as long as some other sneakers - for me, the tread wears down considerably and the white soles get yucky within just a few months. But, for the price, I think they’re worth it"
Adidas,5,adidas normally runs large on me. I ordered a half size down on these cause I like them snug. Love them so much I bought 2 other pairs in different colors.
Adidas,5,"Adidas still as comfortable as ever.  This fit well, has good ventilation and easy to get on and off.  The cloud foam sole is by far my favoritw part of the shoe.  Makes my feet happy."
Adidas,5,Adore this shoes!
Adidas,5,"After reading the reviews, I decided to order a 9.5 instead my usual size 10. I'm so glad I did! They are comfortable and stylish."
Adidas,5,Almost like being barefoot!  I love them. I do not use them for exercise as the padding is not the same. But they are gorgeous and great for just wearing. I thought they were a little tight over my high arch for the first couple of wearings but they loosened up well.
Adidas,5,Already had this style in a different color - I usually am an 8.5 in Nike so I bought that last time in Adidas and they were just a little too big. Got 8s this time and they fit perfect. I LOVE the maroon color! They’re the best shoes because they have laces but just slip on. I wear them almost every day.
Adidas,5,Always loved Adidas great comfort and support will buy again
Adidas,5,Amazing comfort. I could walk for days in these!
Adidas,5,Amazing shoes. Extremely comfortable. I workout in them daily. Wouldn’t recommend for running though.
Adidas,5,Amazing! Usually picky about my tennis shoes - they have to be super comfy (Brooks mostly). Wanted some white ones that weren’t Brooks price but still comfortable. There are perfect!
Adidas,5,Amazingly comfortable! I felt like I was waking on clouds for real. I work 12 hour shifts and I never had to worry that my feet hurt. I would definitely recommend and buy another pair.
Adidas,5,"Amazingly comfortable...  Not only are they super comfy, they are extremely lightweight.

I plan to buy a second pair.  One pair for good and one pair for every day wear."
Adidas,5,Amazon Prime Day deal!  My daughter loves these!  Super cute and stylish!
Adidas,5,Any time I find a shoe that feels and looks amazing.  I always buy a 2nd pair and put on the shelf in closet for future.  LOVE LOVE ...these !
Adidas,5,"Aptly named as Cloudfoam, since they're like walking on a cloud! Great fit!"
Adidas,5,"As a nurse, I’m totally digging how these bad boys side on with ease. The less I have to touch after treading through human excrement of varying sorts is beyond convenient. They look cute too."
Adidas,5,"As a previous college athlete, I am super picky about the shoes I choose to workout in. I have flat feet and these couldn't feel more comfortable. The foam bottom provides a lot of support."
Adidas,5,As advertised
Adidas,5,As always happy with adidas
Adidas,5,"As described, packaged well and arrived quickly!"
Adidas,5,As expected
Adidas,5,As with most adidas I size down a 1/2 size. These are comfy and cute.
Adidas,5,"As you can tell, these shoes have been through a lot! I live in Chicago and walk most places downtown. I wore them brand new out of the box and walked over 7 miles in them. No ""break in"" needed. I frequently get blisters on the back of my ankles and ball of my foot along with knee pain, but had no issues in these which is very rare for me! They're definitely not ""running"" shoes for long distance runs, but they're perfect for walking. I'll probably be buying another pair!"
Adidas,5,Awesome amount of padding around my achilles. These are the first sneakers that actually stay on my feet.
Adidas,5,Awesome fit and nice
Adidas,5,Awesome have them in 2 colors. Love that they are very light. Only negative is sometimes it feels like it maybe a little wide. But overall I am very satisfied.

Adidas,5,"Beautiful shoes! I bought them to use as indoor workout shoes and they fit like a glove in my original size (8). I was worried the tongue would rub on my ankle because of how these are designed, but they didn’t upon multiple uses. I primarily use them for various aerobic exercises, like walking on the treadmill or elliptical."
Adidas,5,Beautiful shoes.
Adidas,5,"Beautiful sneakers. I wear a 7US and I ordered this size in the white/white/black color scheme. They fit marvelously!! Typically in pumas or Nike I find that the toe of the shoes pinch my big toe however that’s not the case with these. I have rods and screws in my leg and have to be selective with what shoes I wear or I hurt the next day these are great, my hardware approves.

Ordered on a Sunday got them on Tuesday."
Adidas,5,"Beautiful.  I saw these at a popular sports store that has a rude name for penis.  They were $79.99 there.  This is an excellent shoe, very comfortable and stylish and the price?!?!  More than 1/2 price!!!!"

Adidas,5,Comfy. Like the memory foam
Adidas,5,Comodo y lindo
Adidas,5,"Completely amazed at how comfortable these are! Right from the box I put them on - ran in the morning in them, worked a full day wearing them. Soo comfortable! I have to say new sneakers normally blister the backs of my heels. Not these! They come up higher in the back and I think that made all the difference. They are cute too! I plan to get more in other colors."
Adidas,5,"Confortable, fit perfectly, just what I expected!"
Adidas,5,"Considering the price for a lot of Adidas sneakers is $100+, these are a STEAL! They're extremely comfortable but are still trendy! I love the sleek look of them and they're easy to slide on and off. I want to buy them in more colors!"
Adidas,5,convenient and comfortable.
Adidas,5,Could pass up the price what a great deal! Faster than expected shipping!
Adidas,5,"Cute & comfortable & breathe well - fewer stars for Support because there is great arch support but they aren’t strong in the side fabric. Not flimsy either, but they aren’t constructed firmly. I happen to like that in a shoe, So don’t let that lack of stars fool you."
Adidas,5,Cute and comfortable
Adidas,5,Cute and comfortable

Yes, yes, and Y E S! I love these! They’re so lightweight and feel like they have memory foam in the insole.

This product runs true to size. I ordered an, which is my usual size in tennis shoes. They fit a little big and I could have gone to the 7.5; I do sometime put insoles in OR wear thick socks which is why I’m keeping the size 8.

I hope my description was of use to you!

—Follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram for more amazing Amazon finds!—"
Adidas,5,Feel so comfy
Adidas,5,Feels amazing!!!! True to size.
Adidas,5,Feels like your walking on clouds
Adidas,5,Feels like you're wearing slippers!
Adidas,5,Fire true to size.  Stylish with pants or shorts/skirts.  Lightweight.  Wore to Disney/Universal for a week of walking many miles per day. Did also bring a pair of running shoes I alternated with.  But these held their own.  I recommend!
Adidas,5,"First day wearing them and they fit absolutely perfect.  True to size.  I can already tell, no ""new shoe"" rubbing or blisters.  These shoes are going to be my new favorite."
Adidas,5,First of all I hate wearing shoes.  But these are REALLY comfortable. They slip on and off easily and look pretty nice. Great for low impact activity and standing for long periods. I would buy again.
Adidas,5,"First shoe in a long time that doesnt make my feet go numb. I tried the slip on version of the shoe and did not like it. The laces give you just enough adjustment while remaining a slip on shoe.

Runs large, order 1/2 to a whole size down"
Adidas,5,"First things first: ARE THEY FAKE?? Answer: NO. They are not fake. They are legitimate Adidas Cloudform Pure shoes. I bought two pairs of these shoes from the seller Amazon, manufacture Adidas - one black, one white. When I first got them, they felt a little tighter than I remember my identical old pair being. I read the reviews, and I got real paranoid about them being counterfeit bc the material felt different and also they didn’t come with an extra pair of laces or one of those spongy-feeling metal ball key chain things that came attached to the lace hole of my previous pair. So. I called Adidas customer service and talked to a customer support person who authenticated these shoes for me. Both pairs are 100% legit. So don’t be worried about buying fake shoes. The most important thing is to look at the serial numbers on the tags on the inside of the shoe. If the serial numbers are the same, they are fake. If left and right are different, they are legitimate.

Ok let get to the actual review.

My feet look like Fred Flintstone got genetically double whammied with bunions.  I’ve had two surgeries on each foot, and they are still bad. But these shoes are good for these boats, and lemme tell ya why:

First, let’s talk material. These shoes are stretchy like maybe a little tight at the top at first, but just wear em inside for a few hours, and they will loosen up. The sole is literally made of clouds, I don’t know how they do it. They are so lightweight and although it doesn’t say non-slip, the traction on them is pretty great.

Now the design on these babies is pretty tailored to me in particular (thanks adidas!) for some reason they included non-functional shoe laces, but the shoe laces break up the shoe in a way that makes them look not so big. I can’t stand a slip on, because a size 11 slip on clearly makes it look like I’m standing in two giant canoes. And something about those goofy loops on the top of the “tongue” (the tongue is fixed) and top of the heel do something to make it look more... flirty? Idk, but the loops make me feel all fancy.

Now... the most important: comfort. Ohhhhh so comfy!! Very light-weight. No pinching anywhere. None of the seams rub weird. I usually get blisters somewhere on new shoes at first, I expected it, but no pain, no blisters. Perfect fit.

If you have finicky feet, give these shoes a try. They look nice, even on big feet. They feel nice, even with bunions."
Adidas,5,"First time i have taken time to write a review. But buy these shoes. Dont wait. Working on my feet all day with arthritis and bone spurs was agony. It made hip and back pain worse. I tried these and i do not even think about my feet. They are not too hot. They are not tight. They are in zero pain. These babies are worth every penny and more. I just purchased my second pair. They made a life long customer out of me. I have recommended these to everyone. Nurses, get these shoes!"
Adidas,5,First time reviewing a pair of shoes from amazon but these are PERFECT!!!! I am so happy! Merry Christmas to me!
Adidas,5,"First, if ur gonna pay for a $55 shoe your gonna get a $55 shoe. U cant expect to cross train in this shoe in total comfort. That completely unrealistic and what people actually complained about on here. Second, go a half size smaller. I feel like it supports the foot better. I personally really like the sneakers ive gotten. Im an 8 now since after pregnancy and i got 7.5 and it fits perfect. The intent i have for my sneakers is for walking. Alot of walking but not Disneyland walking or 3 miles a day walking. If i need more support then i would use tri support insoles i usually get. But if i would expect $55 sneakers to have that kind of support they wouldnt be $55 now would they? Be realistic. Common sense is free."
Adidas,5,Fit a little smaller than Adidas shoes I’ve bought before but I’m sure they’ll stretch out a bit. Super comfortable otherwise and very cute!
Adidas,5,Fit and feel great! May get another pair in another color. Super lightweight.

Adidas,5,"Fits tts, loyal Adidas wearer. The name Cloudfoam is accurate as these feel fantastic. Will these be super long lasting sneakers - no, this is my second pair and they are good but not as durable as say the Ultraboost, which is more than double this price point. Regardless, I’m still a fan for errands and occasional wear when your feet need to be really comfy."
Adidas,5,Fits well! True to size.
Adidas,5,Fits well. No issues
Adidas,5,For my wife : Very comfortable with the foam inside sole and it’s very stylish. She Uses them as her work shoes and she works 40 hours a week so she is walking daily and she loves them

Adidas,5,"For those who stand for long and extended periods of time, these shoes are great in comfort and support.

The top material has some stretch to it and is very breathable which is great for standing. The base is soft with a memory foam sole and is extra comfortable when standing, walking, or running.

These are my casual working shoes or grocery-getters and I cannot give a real review on using them for athletic training."

Laces are a tad too long but I’ll just get a shorter pair. Easy to slip on and off and that’s the best part. Will update in a week to see if the memory foam helps my feet since I’m on em 14 hours a day.

Adidas,5,"Great memory foam shoe that I plan to wear all over the hospital. The different shades of gray and pink letters are unique. Adidas always has strange sizing though. For this particular shoe I had to go up 1/2 a size when usually I go down 1/2.
Also made the mistake of wearing them to use the stairmaster — the tongue of the shoe is tall and kept rubbing against the top of my foot. Might need to wear longer socks next time. Otherwise nice purchase for the price!"

Adidas,5,Great shoe for every day. Super comfortable and easy to slip on and off. I’ve purchased 2 for myself and now a pair for my daughter.
Adidas,5,Great shoe for the price and very comfortable as well.
Adidas,5,"Great shoe for the price. Very comfortable soles, exactly like the description says, “cloud foam.” They are simple black shoes, but still very nice."
Adidas,5,Great shoe! Comfortable and great style. Fits as expected for size I always wear in a sneaker.
Adidas,5,"Great shoe! However, I’m usually a size 7, and I feel that if I had sized down to a 6.5 it would have been perfect."
Adidas,5,"Great shoe! Looks great, goes with everything. Lightweight and airy. Very comfortable. I am very pleased with this purchase."

Adidas,5,Great shoes!
Adidas,5,Great shoes!
Adidas,5,"Great shoes!  A little on the looser side so I might have exchanged for my normal size (since I usually buy shoes one half size up when they are for running).  Lightweight, soft -- feels like you're walking on little clouds."
Adidas,5,Great shoes! Prefect fit!
Adidas,5,"Great shoes! Pretty comfy! Not as soft as the Skechers memory foam shoes, but definitely a close second. Will definitely be a staple in my wardrobe!"
Adidas,5,Great shoes! So lightweight and the perfect color for hiding how dirty shoes can get. Love them!
Adidas,5,"Great shoes! They don’t seem ideal for running or any heavy physical activity, but they’re cute for work or just walking around. I’m usually between a size 7.5 and 8 and ordered the 8. They’re a little big so I would do the smaller size if your in between like me. Also, I tucked in the shoe laces because they’re super long. Overall a great shoe for the price!"
Adidas,5,"Great shoes, buy a half size smaller."
Adidas,5,"Great shoes, super light and super cute! Fit as expected."
Adidas,5,"Great shoes, very light and comfortable."
Adidas,5,Great shoes. Good for running. Very comfortable and breathable. Flexible as well so for hiking they are also great. Durability so far seems to be amazing.
Adidas,5,Great shoes. Super comfortable. They do run about a half size too big but I find that consistant in adidas.
Adidas,5,Great sleek shoes! Able to wash! Great for working out and the color is beautiful. The cloud foam is extra squishy and feels amazing on your feet.
Adidas,5,Great sneakers very comfortable
Adidas,5,"Great sneakers!  So light weight, comfortable on the feet and they look great also!  Want to advise they do run 1/2 size bigger then usual shoe size."
Adidas,5,Great style!
Adidas,5,"Great style. The pictures online show the laces hidden and honestly, they look best that way. Had laced tied up and they don't look as cool. Tuck the laces in and they're perfect. Great for walking on all day activities (i.e. zoo, Disneyland, outlets) they're super comfy and cute."
Adidas,5,Great throw on sneaker
Adidas,5,Great value
Adidas,5,Great value for the money.  I am typically a 9.5 in athletic shoes (rarely ever smaller) but I needed the 9.  Color was exactly what I expected from the pictures.  Have been wearing them to the gym and am very happy with how they feel so far!
Adidas,5,Great!
Adidas,5,Great! No complaints. Better than expected for the price
Adidas,5,"Great, light-weight running shoe. Fits like a dream and really has helped my feet. Very happy with my purchase."
Adidas,5,Greta fit I use these for walking
Adidas,5,Gym
Adidas,5,Gym
Adidas,5,"Had bought a pair just like this but in a different color and loved them so much that I wanted another pair! These are not stuff like most new shoes are, and they are fitted to my feet like they were made for me. I love these shoes and highly recommend them. I’m buying my daughter a pair of these also in her size as they have them for kids too."
Adidas,5,"Had the return do to fit. These shoes are outstanding fit and comfortable, however if have a narrow heel and tongue was to Hugh. Highly recommend"
Adidas,5,"Had these shoes about 2 weeks now and I've worn them for walking around the neighborhood mostly and they are super comfy! Going to start running soon, I'll update on how they hold up."
Adidas,5,Had to return because they were a little big. I would size down one
Adidas,5,Hands down one of if not the most comfortable shoe I’ve ever owned. I absolutely love them and they are super cute with leggings
Adidas,5,"Happy wife, good nights!!!"
Adidas,5,hard to find shoes that don't hurt my toes or my bonions.  These are the ones!
Adidas,5,Has some arch support and very comfortable and light weight.
Adidas,5,"Have now brought 3 pairs of these shoes.
They always fit,are comfortable and no laces to do up"
Adidas,5,Have these shoes in almost every color!
Adidas,5,"Haven't used for working out yet, but wore out and about a couple times. They are bouncy, fit nice, comfy, and look good on my size 9 feet- sometimes sneakers can accentuate my 'large' foot, but the make them look 'small'. They are true to fit, for someone that uses a normal-then sock."
Adidas,5,Haven't worked out in them yet! But I will. Dealing with Plantar fasciitis. Which is why I purchased them for more cushion.
Adidas,5,"Heaven, love cloudfoams!"
Adidas,5,"Hermosos tenis para ir al gym o  caminar,mi esposa quedo feliz con ellos y dice que son super comodos."
Adidas,5,Hey happy good debar
Adidas,5,high quality product!
Adidas,5,Highly recommend
Adidas,5,"Highly recommend getting these because they are super comfortable. I usually have pain on the ball of my foot but with these shoes, I dont feel any pain"
Adidas,5,Highly recommend these shoes!! I love them and get so many compliments!
Adidas,5,"Holy cow, I can't believe I'm saying this but I am IN LOVE with a pair of sneakers. These bad boys are heavenly, the outer part is soft and stretchy, they're super lightweight, they conform to your foot and the Cloudfoam makes you feel like you're walking on a literal cloud and they're stylish too! I love these. I haven't tried running or exercising in them yet so I hope they hold up but for walking a distance like I do on campus quite often, they're awesome. And I usually get shin splints from walking a lot and running at the gym but with this shoe, I haven't had any issues. Mamma Mia, these shoes are ***kisses fingertips like an old Italian man*** perfecto. I want at least another pair or five."
Adidas,5,Honestly the most comfortable shoes I’ve had in a while.
Adidas,5,Honestly this is my second time purchasing this particular sneaker. One very comfortable and two stylish.
Adidas,5,I  wanted a nice pair of sneakers you can walk around with and not just for exercise. These fit like a glove are super comfortable and look nice enough to hang out in. Love them.
Adidas,5,"I absolutely adore these shoes!! They are so comfy and lightweight, I could wear them forever. And they look super cute!!"
Adidas,5,I absolutely live these shoes! Would buy again. Super comfortable and light weight!
Adidas,5,"I absolutely love how comfortable these shoes are. I don't use them for running because I buy higher end pairs for that, but they are great for slipping on to go on errands or even for short walks."
Adidas,5,"I absolutely love my shoes. I got a size 7, it fit as expected. I got them dirty and put them in the washer and it looks brand new now. It has padding on it. The only thing is that if your constantly using it all the time, it’ll eventually wear out. Other then that, worth it to me!"
Adidas,5,"I absolutely LOVE these running shoes. They are extremely light weight, feels like you are running on air yet with support. Super cute, look exactly as pictured & are true to size. I always wear a 6 and the 6 fit me perfectly. I would order these 100 times over, actually contemplating getting another pair in a different color just because these are so perfect. I’ve had them for over 2 months and they have not worn out at all. Wipes clean and doesn’t stain which is amazing!! I regularly run outside so I destroy my running shoes, these I’ve just taken a wet paper towel to and they are good as new! Sooo so happy with this purchase!"
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these shoes and I have received lots of compliments on them. They are very comfortable! I had forgotten that when your feet are happy you're happy!! I love the way these shoes look! My feet tend to be a bit on the chubby side and these shoes make them look slender...haha! Love Adidas shoes! I tried these on in a store before I purchased them on Amazon. I think Adidas sizes are a bit different than your typical sizing. I normally wear an 8 and I wear a 7 in these shoes.
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these shoes I bought two pairs. I’m a RN so I’m on my feet for sometimes more than 12 hours straight and I do think they could be a little more cushioned but they’re still great and are super cute.
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these shoes!
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these shoes!  i had found them in maroon at TJ Maxx for $40 and fell in love.  But did not want to spend $70 to get the black ones (retail value) so why not try amazon?  $47?!?!?!  YES PLEASE! :)
Adidas,5,"I absolutely love these shoes!  So much I bought two pairs.  The first pair I paid $50 which I felt was super reasonable.  Then they went on sale for $35 so I bought them in another color.  I’ve been rotating them both on my Disney trip and they have been awesome.  So great for tired feet.  I agree with others that they aren’t “running” shoes, but you can walk in them for days or do low impact exercise."
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these shoes! It’s lije your wearing butter 😍 I’m usually a 7 1/2 and I wear a 7 in these. So I suggest size down at least by half a size. I have been looking for good “cute” comfortable shoes forever my daughter bought a pair and I fell in love! Of course she hates we have matching shoes lol
Adidas,5,"I absolutely love these shoes! They are super comfortable and fit true to size. Based on other reviews, I was a bit worried about the potential for the soles to wear out quickly, but I’ve worn them quite a bit and have not had a problem with wear. I would definitely recommend these shoes!"
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these shoes! They are super comfortable and stylish. I have used them working out and walking around all day at the ball field. My son and daughter both sneak and wear them and love them too!
Adidas,5,"I absolutely love these shoes!!! Amazing quality, nice fit, comfy support. A must buy."
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these shoe's.
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these shoes. Loved them so much I bought my daughter a pair.
Adidas,5,"I absolutely love these shoes. The fit was true to size and they are so incredibly comfortable, sporty and stylish. I love them. I’m so sad I got them dirty, which is the only downside at least in the lighter colors is that there hard to keep clean. But A+++ I definitely recommend them there great. I want to get a second pair. Also I do believe there Authentic. They came in an Adidas box with tissue and had Adidas price tags attached to the shoes."
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these sneakers!!! I’ve been on the hunt for a new pair that are reasonably priced. I got these for my birthday and immediately ordered another color after a few wears because they are so comfy! They do run a little big so I’d suggest going a half size down when ordering.
Adidas,5,"I absolutely love these sneakers. I am used to purchasing Nike Frees. I have two pairs of those that have lasted me 3+ years. I actually wanted a white pair of sneakers so that I could wear them to dance on my wedding day. I chose these, and I have no regrets. I didn't just wear them on my wedding day, but I've been wearing them daily to work. They look really sleek. The color is great (though obviously white gets dirty a little faster). They're overall easy to clean. I replaced the shoelaces with ""laceless"" ones. The most important thing is that these sneakers are super comfortable. Would definitely recommend."
Adidas,5,I absolutely LOVE these tennis shoes! The most comfortable ones I've ever had for sure! I did go a half size down (normally I'm a size 7) but purchased a size 6 1/2 and they fit perfectly! Definitely going to buy them in the black color as well.
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these tennis shoes.  Comfortable straight out of the box and fit is true to size.
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these. They are so lightweight and comfortable.
Adidas,5,I absolutely love these. They fit true to size. They feel like your walking on a cloud. So light weight. Will definitely order again.
Adidas,5,I absolutely love this shoe. Easy to slide on. Super comfortable. Color is perfect. Just all around a perfect walking/ standing shoe.
Adidas,5,"I absolutely loved these Adidas shoes. The size fit perfectly, and their super comfy. The shoes are light weight and overall quality was great. Highly recommended"
Adidas,5,I actually ordered the wrong size so mine were several sizes too big. Beautiful shoes and comforterable as ever had they fit perfect I'd have kept them. I returned and got the same ones! I work for nursing so its important to have good shoes!
Adidas,5,I add arch support and they're my favorite tennis shoes! I have them in 5 colors!❤️😁👍
Adidas,5,I added orthotics to this shoe perfect I love it because it attracted me for its looks and it’s so comfortable
Adidas,5,"I adore these adidas cloud foam pure sneakers! You must order a half size or whole size down though, I’m a solid women’s 8 and chose 7.5, I still have a small amount of room but I’m happy with them. I’ll be ordering more."
Adidas,5,"I already had a pair of these in grey, and was confident that I could order another pair online. These shoes are very comfortable, even on a plus size woman.  They did not take much time to break in which I really appreciated!  There is some strain on my foot during long workouts, but that’s more so my foot’s shape than the shoe. I think these are comfortable, affordable but still cute!"
Adidas,5,"I already have another pair of Cloudfoam shoes that I love and couldn’t pass up this color/fabric. I get compliments on them e dry time I wear them and they’re ridiculously comfortable. I love the crimped detail on the laces even, makes them just slightly more cool than a regular pair of tennies."
Adidas,5,I always add arch support to running shoes. They fit as expected and are very comfortable
Adidas,5,I always wear a size 5 in women’s and a 3-4 in kids.  But these run a lot smaller. Definitely go up a full size.
Adidas,5,"I am 56 years old and I have never ever had running shoes so comfortable!  I am a size 9 and I ordered a size 9, fits perfectly!  It’s like putting on bedroom slippers but with the benefit of when you put them on you know you’re getting going to exercise and get healthy.  I only wish that I got paid to do a commercial, that’s how much I love the shoes!  These shoes are A hearty Covid free hug with your best friend!!!!!

Highly recommend ...  !!!"
Adidas,5,"I am a nurse and am on my feet a lot and bought these shoes to wear for work. First of all, they are super cute and don't make my feet look big like some of the other shoes I tried. They have memory foam cushion in the bottom that is super comfy. The cloth of the shoe is very flexible and makes my feet feel warm and cozy like no other tennishoe has ever done. They do not have a ton of arch support which is fine for me as I have flatter feet and arch support feels weird to me. Also, the white bottoms of the shoes stay very clean somehow. My 7 year old has similar Adidas shoes and his stay clean too although I have no idea how!"
Adidas,5,I am a nurse with arthritis and bunions in both feet.  I am usually hesitant about buying work shoes without trying them on.  These soft sided shoes are awesome!  I am so pleased with how my feet feel at the end of a twelve hour shift!  I would highly recommend!
Adidas,5,"I am a nurse.  I am on my feet for long hours and these shoes are fantastic.  They are lightweight, cool, and stylish.  They fit true to size and great for someone with a wider foot.  I ended up buying a second pair in the mint green color because I liked them so much."
Adidas,5,"I am a size 6 and I usually need to buy running shoes half a size or one size smaller because they tend to run smaller, but for the first time ever I bought running shoes exactly my size and I am not dissapointed. They are super comfortable, true to size and Im just so happy they fit so nice!"
Adidas,5,I am beyond impressed with the quality of this shoe for the price!
Adidas,5,I am going to throw away all my hills and buy more of this shoes in all colors available!
Adidas,5,I am hard to buy shoes for. However when i bought these I was in love. Even bought an identical pair just like it for back up when these get old.
Adidas,5,"I am impressed with the  comfort, style, color, I would recommend this shoe without hesitation."
Adidas,5,"I am in love with these shoes. I purchased a second pair because I like the fit, comfort and look"
Adidas,5,"I am in love with these shoes. They fit true to size, and are super comfy. If you have high arches these probably aren't the most supportive in that regard, bu they're just so comfortable!"
Adidas,5,I am in love with these they are better looking then the picture love them ❤️
Adidas,5,"I am in LOVE!! I ordered these on Thursday night and they just arrived around 9:30 am on Monday. I read like 40 reviews before buying and nearly everyone said to size down. I am usually all over the place in sizing between an 11 and a 12 for shoes. Like, from Torrid an 11 falls off of me because they think everyone has wide feet and calves, and at Kohl's an 11 women's shoe doesn't even fit halfway up my foot. So, I ordered an 11 because that's the highest size they had and it. fits. perfectly. In the first photo the back of one shoe looks to be gapping but that's because of the way my heel was sitting. They feel lighter than air. If you need a shoe that feels super comfortable on your foot but weighs the amount of a feather, buy these shoes. The second photo is posted to show that they look a little narrow. I personally love this because my feet are on the narrower side. The second I put these on my family member said, ""wow, they really make your feet look smaller!"" here's hoping they hold up well."
Adidas,5,I am normally a nike fan but decided to try something new and boy was I surprised. I love them they are so light and  flexible. Will definitely be buying another pair.
Adidas,5,I am obsessed with these they are so cute and comfy. And so inexpensive! I am so glad I finally purchased
Adidas,5,"I am on my feet a lot this shoes are perfect, soooo comfortable, I love them 😍"
Adidas,5,"I am on my feet for 12+ hours a day and these are the most comfortable shoes by far. I am on my third pair. I can not believe how comfortable they are for the price! If you’re on the fence, buy them!"
Adidas,5,I am on my feet for 12+ hours a day in these things and my feet feel great after my long shifts. I was a little skeptical at first but they really do feel like clouds on your feet. I have had them for about a month and they barely show any wear so I’m confident they will last a long tim!
Adidas,5,I am really pleased with these! very light and comfy. The only thing is they are a bit wide for me around the ankle area.
Adidas,5,I am so in love with this shoe!! It’s like walking/ running  on pillows
Adidas,5,"I am using these to replace a pair of Cloudfoam QT's, and honestly I love these. The same squishy comfort of the Cloudfoam, but the slightly different cut of these is really sleek. I love the ""no-tongue"" feature and how breezy and flexible the outer material is. They're weightless. I also just think they are ""flattering"" on my feet and make them look slender."
Adidas,5,I am usually an 8.5 so that is what I got. There is a little room. I may have been able to order an 8. But that doesn't bother me. They don't rub or side around for being a bit bit. Super comfy and look great with yoga pants.
Adidas,5,"I believe I bought these a year ago now and they are still just as comfortable and holding up to my use well. I have left them out in a couple rather massive rainstorms, worn them through a few perilous terrains, and my cat has slept on them more than once.

The only thing I changed were the laces, I took them out entirely and turned them into slip-ons. Just my preference"
Adidas,5,I bought a pair at another store and they were so comfortable that I looked for another pair in a different color. I work in them on concrete floor and am on my feet a good part of the day. I’m a fan!  Wish I could buy more colors but I need to be practical. I highly recommend!
Adidas,5,"I bought a pair in a different color at Norstrom rack but found them on Amazon for cheaper. They run a little big, so if you are between sizes I would go down. They are super comfortable, I wouldn't' say they're the best for working out."
Adidas,5,"I bought a pair of these in black at DSW and loved them so much wanted another pair. They are slip on (which I like), but tie to make more snug if needed. I feel like my feet are supported and yet these are lightweight, don't make my feet sweat and I can wear them all day. (As a shoes off, and slippers on in the house person, sometimes I forget to take these off!) I love the maroon color to spice up my footwear pallet. (I am not a runner, but I do wear these for walking, power walking, playing with the kids and they have been perfect for that.)"
Adidas,5,"I bought an 8.5 and they were a little too small, the 9’s were $30 more so did not get them. I liked the style and seemed light and comfortable."
Adidas,5,I bought another pair after this one in a different color because they are so lightweight and comfortable. I go on walks with them and can lift weights but I wouldn't wear them for running or other high impact activity as they aren't THAT supportive. Great for every day wear!
Adidas,5,I bought for my sister she wore them to Disneyland all day. Comfortable trendy shoe we got grey white honestly thinking of buying one for myself
Adidas,5,"I bought my first pair at a store and loved them they fit perfectly and they looked good with leggings.So I ordered my second pair and they are narrow, can't even get my foot in them and the quality is not the same.  So disappointed!"
Adidas,5,"I bought my first pair of these at a store and tried them on.  They only had a size 7, and I normally wear a size 7.5.  The size 7 felt pretty comfortable.  They were a bit snug, but given the style, I knew they would break in.  Let me tell you!  They were the most comfortable shoes I probably ever owned within hours!  They were so comfortable, in fact, that I sought out a deal to buy some in more basic colors.  I have plantar fasciitis and back problems, and these shoes seem to help both.  My feet are pretty average width though.  I can see these not being as comfortable to someone with a wider width.  Though I feel they may even be flexible enough to break in for someone with wider feet.  I do note that the black seem a bit tighter and aren't quite as comfortable to the top of my feet.  That being said, I haven't really tried because I have two other pairs.  But I feel like I should have gone with my normal size in the black."
Adidas,5,I bought on  sale as a good deal. but they are good shoes. I got a good deal and would buy again
Adidas,5,I bought them for my mom.  She loves them.
Adidas,5,I bought these a half size larger only because it’s all they had. I figured I’d try them and return them if they were too big. They fit perfectly so I’d recommend buying half size larger. I LOVE them. They are so cute and offer amazing support.
Adidas,5,I bought these as a gift for my mom and she can’t stop talking about how comfy they are! She did mention that in the winter months she won’t use them as much due to being able to feel the breeze through the mesh.
Adidas,5,I bought these as more of an everyday tennis shoe instead of a workout shoe so I can’t speak to how well they due for that. They’re comfortable and fit great.
Adidas,5,"I bought these based on a recommendation, and would absolutely purchase again. I haven't washed them yet, so I can't speak to how they last after that, however they are incredibly comfortable. I am able to walk in them easily throughout the day with no foot pain. There isn't a ton of arch support however thankfully I don't need much. They are super easy to slip on and definitely are a cute and versatile shoe. Would highly recommend- I also note that I wouldn't use them for working out as I am definitely a bigger girl and I would personally need a more structured and supportive shoe for jogging/running and jumping in particular just due to my size."
Adidas,5,"I bought these because I’m on my feet all day long and I wanted a shoe that had good support and was also super comfy. These fit that, and they’re cute! Bonus: I got them for about half the price here on Amazon than I would’ve on the Adidas website. Super pleased with this purchase!"
Adidas,5,I bought these for $50.00 and I really can't complain. They are super comfortable and very cute.
Adidas,5,I bought these for my daughter and she says the shoes are very comfy and feel great to run in.
Adidas,5,I bought these for my daughter when she said she wanted to start walking again for health reasons and she said they fit perfectly and are so comfortable!
Adidas,5,I bought these for my Granddaughter.  She says they are really comfortable and what she was looking for.
Adidas,5,"I bought these for my mom for christmas. She is a size 7.5 but these did not fit her, i had to return and purchase a 8.5. She loved them so much that we took our chances with the 8.5 size. Thankfully they worked ! i would of liked if adidas made shoes that are wide fit for wide feet. All in all, it is a good shoe and its super comfortable according to my mom."
Adidas,5,I bought these for my Mother and she loves them.
Adidas,5,I bought these for my mother for Christmas and she absolutely loves them. They are so lightweight and are durable.
Adidas,5,"I bought these for my sister-in-law for her birthday. I havent given them to her yet, but I think she will love them! They were on sale, and I got them for $14! Total score! They look to be the correct size and they are super lightweight!"
Adidas,5,I bought these for my wife for her birthday and she has wore them several times and they still look great.
Adidas,5,I bought these for our upcoming Disney trip. They are super comfortable and cute. I haven’t broken them in yet but I think they will work well for our trip!
Adidas,5,"I bought these for traveling on a long overseas flight. I love that these are slip on to get through security faster. They are very comfy and breathable. They provide good support for walking, but I probably would not use these as running shoes. I usually wear between a US7.5 to 8 and I went with 8 and it’s a little but large but I wanted something that had room to wear compression socks and to breathe. I probably could have gotten away with ordering a 7.5. The affordability of these is great for what they are. Keep in mind that they are not meant for aggressive exercise."
Adidas,5,I bought these for walking shoes and absolutely love. They are so comfortable and lightweight I could walk for hours and my feet are never tired. I also love the color.
Adidas,5,I bought these for wearing inside the house while doing housework. They are super comfy and with my size 11  canoe feet they look decent and not like clown shoes.  I don’t think they would be the best for running in wet areas of weather. They are kind of triple bonded mesh like. Over all I would probably buy another pair for the sunny days here in the PNW. They serve the purpose easily for wearing inside.
Adidas,5,I bought these for work as a medical assistant at a clinic.  They are so comfortable and light.
Adidas,5,I bought these for working in the galley on a yacht they are comfortable but do breakdown easily. I would not go running in them but then again I no longer run. They are light weight and perfect for walking around indoors
Adidas,5,"I bought these shoes for a trip to Florida.  They were cute, lightweight, & comfortable.  I wore them for a week straight walking the parks & my feet never hurt. Also fit true to size. I used the size chart."
Adidas,5,"I bought these shoes for casual, comfy days.  Do I plan on running in these?  No.  In all fairness, I probably wouldn’t run in any shoes (unless I was being chased by a predator or running for the last bar of chocolate on earth).  These shoes were instantly comfortable. I wear a 9-9.5.  The ball part of my foot is med to wide; the heel of my foot is narrow. These work great.  I ordered 9.5 and these are true to size. They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width. I can tied the securely so the heel fits. I love the cushy memory foam. I plan on wearing these at Disney, they are that comfortable.  They look pretty good. If I survive walking 5-10 miles at Disney, I will come back and update my post Disney experience. If I don’t survive, it probably was no fault of these shoes. I’d say one too many ice creams or getting into deadly fight triggered by one too many renditions of “It’s a Small World.”"
Adidas,5,I bought these shoes for my daily runs and I love them! They provide a good amount of comfort without being too soft or squishy inside. This allows them to still give good support while running.
Adidas,5,"I bought these shoes for my mom and she loves them! She says that they’re comfortable, lightweight, and great to wear at work!"
Adidas,5,"I bought these shoes for my wife as a fashion / casual shoe. I've bought her plenty of high end running shoes for running but she needed a comfortable pair of casual shoes that she could wear with a number of different outfits. These shoes work well for that. I bought the grey/white color which she can wear with jeans, workout clothes and a number of different clothes. She wears them all the time and stated that they are comfortable and true to size. She has plenty of options to choose from when it comes to shoes but I see her wear these shoes more than any other pair. The price was reasonable and they have held up well so far. I would recommend these shoes."
Adidas,5,"I bought these shoes for my wife because she wanted comfortable shoes to wear during her 3rd trimester. And, she loved them. She still wears them now for walking."
Adidas,5,"I bought these shoes for the look - they are super cute with leggings and look tidy enough for me to wear them with jeans on a Friday at work.  I bought my first pair of these late in my second trimester of pregnancy, and it was really convenient not to have to worry about tying laces all the time, as they slip on easily and don't slide around.  The laces are really more for show anyway - they don't tighten easily, and they don't provide much support.  Because of the laces, I wouldn't have even considered running in these shoes, even if that were my intended purpose.

That said, I bought these because they were cute.  I didn't buy them for working out.  I do wear them occasionally when I lift weights or do a HIIT workout at home, and I love them for an urban mosey or a walk in the park, but I wouldn't wear them for the gym or out on a more serious hike.

I bought a second pair last week and took a gamble on a half-size smaller than my normal size, since the smaller pair was on deep discount.  These go on sale regularly, so try not to buy full price if you can help it!  The smaller size actually fits a lot more comfortably, so I think these run a little big, which is also my experience with Adidas running shoes."
Adidas,5,I bought these shoes in a different color at a store and love them so much I bought this pair as well. They are comfortable and fit true to size. Super light for everyday wear.
Adidas,5,"I bought these shoes to walk around New Orleans. Not only are they stylish, they are also comfortable!! I wish I went down a half size (only because my toes push forward when wearing them at the gym) but I still feel comfortable wearing them. I love them so much I am going to order another pair !!"
Adidas,5,"I bought these shoes to wear for some indoor workouts where others are barefoot but I wanted a little support, and also to have an extra pair that felt good to wear all day. They look great and the soles are really comfortable."
Adidas,5,I bought these since they were on sale. I'm glad I did. They are very light weight. They do feel skinny around the middle of the shoe but not in the toe box. I like the firm feeling around my foot and arch. I didn't realize there isn't a tongue until I tried them on not that I notice it at all. I am one who doesn't untie my shoes most of the time and these are great because after you tie them you can slide them on and off easily but I haven't had any trouble with them falling off and I'm on my feet all day.
Adidas,5,I bought these to use as my work shoes. 12 hour night shifts running all over I need a comfy shoe and these are very lightweight. Would buy again.
Adidas,5,I bought these to wear to work because I’m on my feet a lot. They are really comfortable for the entire 9-10 hour shift. I also wore them hiking & they were great. Very lightweight.
Adidas,5,"I bought these to wear with my scrubs at work, and I love them!! They’re so much more comfortable than medical clogs."
Adidas,5,"I bought these when I was pregnant to have something cute but comfy to wear and they are perfect! I hate big and bulky tennis shoes and these are no that at all, they are very very light"
Adidas,5,I bought this for my fiancé and she loves everything about it!
Adidas,5,"I bought this product and wasn't sure how it would fit, but I love it. Important thing to note is that they don't untie or adjust, the laces are more like decoration, they just slide on and off so its important to get the right size. I love them though, they are very versatile, and super comfortable!"
Adidas,5,"I bought this shoe specifically because most reviews said it's like wearing a sandal. If you're like me and love running with shoes that feel super lightweight and actually feel where you placed your foot, this is that kind of shoe! Bad knee? Not for you! Flat foot? Maybe not"
Adidas,5,I broke my foot 11 years ago and have screws in my left foot. It is hard to find shoes that are comfortable. Ive bought so many only to return them after wearing a couple of hrs b/c my foot starts hurting. On day 3 of these. They are awesome and very stylish. Ordered a 9 and wear a 9.
Adidas,5,I brought fo my mom she said it's really comfortable for her.
Adidas,5,I can walk all day and night in these sneakers!! If you walk you should be walking in these!!
Adidas,5,I can walk for 10 to 15 miles straight and have no issues with support and comfort.  I never give a five stars but these sneakers definitely earned 5 stars.  I bought a size 8.5 (my size) they fit great with socks.  Without socks you can get away with buying a size 8.
Adidas,5,"I can wear these to work all day and they are so cute and comfortable but they are NOT for walking, running, or working out."
Adidas,5,"I can’t say enough about how cute and comfortable they are. I WOULD go a half size smaller though, as they are so soft. Feels like wearing slippers."
Adidas,5,"I cannot say it enough. These shoes are THE BEST shoe I have had. I love them so much I have 4 pairs. They are comfortable, affordable, cute, easy to put on and off fast, and light weight. Perfect shoe for everyday wear and for working out. I will buy these forever!"
Adidas,5,I can't believe I got these for such a great steal...I mean deal! I've been searching for a white casual sneaker and these fit the bill. They're comfortable and light. I haven't used them to workout but I'm sure they'd work out fine.
Adidas,5,"I could walk all day in these, and I've gotten compliments on the look. Easy to throw in the wash when they get dirty."
Adidas,5,"I debating getting these sneakers for weeks. I really wanted a slip on sneaker to walk my dog but still wanted decent support. I didn’t realize until they arrived that they are all one piece. The higher back allows for you to hold them while slipping your foot in. The laces are functional in the sense that they can make the shoe tighter if your foot is very narrow but it’s really not needed.

Fit: I usually wear a 7 or 7.5 and bought size 7. They fit perfectly but with no room to spare. A 7.5 would be too large for sure.

Width: These are a very narrow shoe. I’ve included a picture compared to my adidas boost running sneakers.

Function: NOT for running. These are a walking or fashion sneaker. I was surprised after receiving that other reviewers mentioned getting injured after running in these because the minute you take them out of the box you should know they aren’t suitable for that. I walk 3 miles 2-3 times a week and wear these to work pretty often. They work perfectly for that kind of wear but not a high impact activity like running.

Comfort: They are extremely comfortable and very light weight. The fabric is breathable.

Cons: The sole creases in the middle after only a couple wears. They run narrow and might not fit a wider foot. The bottom scuffs away pretty easy and so I think that will be the first part to wear down making them unwearable. I would still buy another pair regardless of these things.

Pros: They look good, feel good and are incredibly functional and versatile. The slip on style is great for people who just don’t want to tie their shoes (you know who you are!) and the branding isn’t in your face slapped all over the shoe.

10/10 would recommend and as soon as I can afford it I’ll be buying a 2nd pair"
Adidas,5,"I definitely like this shoe. I had a pair of Nike free runs before, and these weren't too different. I like how the tongue is attached to the shoe. The reason I needed a new pair was because my Nike's were falling apart- especially at the tongue of the shoe. These seem really sturdy, and I have been enjoying them on my runs so far (I run every morning). The only (small) complaint I have is that they allow my foot to escape the shoe just a little bit while I run; they're not the most adjustable pair of shoes. Nevertheless, I know they won't come off my feet or anything, and they've treated me well these past couple of weeks."
Adidas,5,I did buy a half a size smaller they run big. They are very comfortable and lightweight
Adidas,5,I did size a 1/2 size down and I love
Adidas,5,"I do 5 mile walks in these shoes and my feet don't hurt! SUPER COMFORTABLE!! However the soles have given out pretty fast, only 6 months n its already starting to wear. but then again i am walking alot! MY best friend says she doesn't even care if they don't last long, they are so comfortable shes wants another pair!"
Adidas,5,"I do not run; only do elliptical and body weight exercises.  Really soft, comfortable support. Really is like walking on a cloud. When doing lunges, the impact is very well cushioned.  Not tight, even though it is not a “laced” sneaker. And front of the foot is not uncomfortable either. Putting them on with a shoe horn does make things easier."
Adidas,5,I do not wear mine to workout. I wear them as casual out and about footwear. They are super cute and super comfy. True to size.
Adidas,5,I don’t know that I’d use these to work out in unless I’m doing a light jog.  I don’t think this shoe is sturdy enough to do a heavy workout.  But they’re so comfortable!  I’m pregnant at the moment and the shoe is just right.
Adidas,5,"I don’t understand all the bad reviews, these are literally my everyday shoes! I’m a waitress, I run around like crazy, and at the end of my shift it doesn’t feel like I’ve been on my feet all day.
They are tight at first, and take some time to break in, after a week it’s effortless to put them on.
I also have very wide feet, and after breaking them in I have no issues. I typically wear a 8 1/2 W but these are 9s.
I have the black pair also, and I absolutely love these shoes."
Adidas,5,I dont know if they are good for running but they are def soft and cloud feeling
Adidas,5,I don't think I've ever left an Amazon review - much less a positive one - but I have to say these shoes make me so happy. They are sooo comfortable to walk in. I could do an amusement park all day long and not get the awful sore/aching feet that I usually do. I actually smile when I think about how comfy these are. Really wasn't expecting much but I'm pleasantly surprised
Adidas,5,"I don't usually buy shoes online, so I was worried that they wouldn't fit right. I wear a size 10, and have a wide foot. Well, these fit PERFECTLY. No breaking in period either. I'm going to order more!"
Adidas,5,"I feel like I’m wearing slippers !!
So comfy"
Adidas,5,"I find these very comfortable, I have a narrow heel and high arch and they seem to offer lots of support."
Adidas,5,I find these very comfortable. Probably could have gone with a half size smaller because they're wide. Very light also.
Adidas,5,I first ordered them smaller than I usually get in adidas because my friend had ordered some and gone down a full size. Well they were to small. So I reordered in my reg size and they were perfect!
Adidas,5,"I flippin love them! I don't think I'll buy a different type of shoe again, they are so lightweight, comfortable, and airy!! It fits perfect/true to size! I love them!"
Adidas,5,"I freaking love these. Super comfortable.

Wore them to meet my girl friend and she was wearing them in black. Great to walk around nyc in all day.

When I buy again I am going to try a half size down."
Adidas,5,"I gave them as a gift . I sent them back for a half size smaller .

I could not have guess how excited she would get , getting  these shoes"
Adidas,5,"I gave these a 5 rating because they are so comfortable. Having said that, know these few little things about them before buying.

They do not feel like they have very much support in the arch. Because of that, I do not wear them to the gym to work out. I WILL wear them for a long walk or a full day of walking."
Adidas,5,I get a lot of compliments
Adidas,5,I get so many compliments on my new shoes!! They look and feel great
Adidas,5,I got a size 11 in these shoes and they were too big. Returned for a size 10. Love them! They are so comfortable.
Adidas,5,"I got exactly what I thought i was going to get.
These shoes are lightweight, comfortable and are very durable.

I'm a size 9, and these fit exactly like I expected they would."
Adidas,5,"I got size 5.5 because i have a nike shoes that’s 5.5.
Nike fits good with a little bit of room but adidas 5.5 seems a bit smaller. But not uncomfortable. Cloudfoam is so comfortable and light. My favorite daily shoes!"
Adidas,5,I got the grey in 6 1/2 which is my normal shoe size and they fit perfect. I love the color and style. Slips right on and the material is so breathable that I can wear them without socks. The cushioned insole is a dream. When you put a pair of sneakers on and you sigh because they feel so good you have found a great pair of shoes!
Adidas,5,"I got them for walking, so comfy I could walk the dogs all day. Even ran a block in them and I don’t run."
Adidas,5,"I got them in two colors because I love them so much! I always used Nike, but have become adidas obsessed and will never go back."
Adidas,5,I got these for a steal ... 42 dollars. I just wanted something casual to wear with leggings or jeans. I absolutely love them. They are so comfortable and great to throw on to run some errands or wear out for a casual setting. Love the color too. Bought the white and gray. I am a 7 and bought a 7. I do have some room from my toe to the to of the shoe but i do like my sneakers a little roomy
Adidas,5,I got these for my daughter. They fit true to size. We live the light color of the light grey and white.
Adidas,5,"I got these for my mom. She does fitness classes at least 2x a week. She said they are very comfortable and supportive. Highly recommend, especially for the price!"
Adidas,5,I got these for my wife because i have praised mine so much.  I am on my 2nd pair and I loved it so much I bought 2 of the exact same shoe.
Adidas,5,I got these for work. I’m on my feet for hours a day. These help me so much to walk all day and back n forth. Love them no much.
Adidas,5,I got these in all white in. 9 1/2 they fit me perfect. They are so comfortable. This is day 3 at the gym and they are so comfortable on my feet
Adidas,5,I got these just to look cute. I would not recommend these as a running shoe. Easy to slip on and off. Very light weight and comfy.
Adidas,5,"I got these on sale and love them, so comfortable and light weight"
Adidas,5,I got these shoes because I work in dental and needed something supportive and comfortable. I ordered a second pair and they are fantastic.
Adidas,5,"I got these shoes in a 8, which is my usual size and these fit wonderfully. They're very comfortable and so cute."
Adidas,5,"I got these shoes in one day, I couldn’t believe that. They were a little tight on top but just needed to broken in and they’re awesome!"
Adidas,5,I got these shoes to spend 5 days walking around Disneyland in. The shoes were so comfortable and held up great with no need to ware them in. I will be buying these again.
Adidas,5,"I got these to replace a similar looking sneaker I'd had for many years and loved.  I thought I would have to break them in, but they were comfortable from the first moment I put them on."
Adidas,5,"I got these to wear at work -- i have a standing desk, so comfortable shoes are important. They're so comfy that I've been wearing them everywhere since they arrived! I'm probably going to buy another pair or two in more colors.

Also, don't let their appearance fool you. The laces are real -- you can use them to adjust the fit -- but these are definitely slip on shoes!"
Adidas,5,"I got these to wear for my 12.5 hour shifts on a very busy nursing floor. They are so comfortable and my feet feel good all day. The shoes also look really good!

Many reviewers said they run big, I don't agree. I wear an 8.5 and the sizing feels correct to me. Maybe a tiny bit more room but I personally think they are perfect."
Adidas,5,"I got these to wear on vacation as they seemed good for slipping on and off quickly at airports while also being good for light hiking (or tbh walking through the woods with kids). I wear them almost everywhere now. They are light weight and comfortable, and cute too!"
Adidas,5,I got this for my mother.. and she really liked it a lots..
Adidas,5,"I got two pairs of these shoes; different colors. They fit as expected and are so very comfortable. I did not have to break them in at all. I love them. I highly recommend them - maybe not for running, but definitely for walking and everyday wear."
Adidas,5,I had a pair before I really enjoyed it
Adidas,5,I had a pair I tried on in the store and fell in love! I’m at 7.5 to 8(Depending on the brand) I wear an 8 in these shoes! My feet are thinner so these shoes are perfect!
Adidas,5,I had a pair of these before and was thrilled to find another. they are great.
Adidas,5,I had a pair of these shoes before. So i reordered these shoes. They lasted for two years. It takes about two weeks to break the shoes in.  But they're worth buying. If you have a wide foot it will take time to break in.
Adidas,5,I had purchased the black pair in store once and loved it so I decided to order the gray pair from Amazon. Still amazing. I am a size 9 F and ordered a 9 (fit is perfect).
Adidas,5,I had some adidas similar to these a couple years ago. They were super comfy as they had the cloud foam too. Thought I’d get some new ones. These were Super comfortable and great for the price 👌🏻  Can’t complain
Adidas,5,I had to buy a full size smaller than I normally wear. But despite that they are the most comfortable tennis shoes I have ever purchased.
Adidas,5,"I had to get used to the way the back is constructed, but they are very comfortable."
Adidas,5,I had to order an 8.5 instead of 9 because there is no tongue to adjust the size.
Adidas,5,"I had to return a pair and get a new one, up a half size than my usual! But I live in them! So comfortable! Getting in other colors!"
Adidas,5,I had tried these on in a store before so I knew to size down. I am an 8.5 and I am wearing an 8 in these. They will stretch and give a little bit so don’t get discouraged if you size down and your toe may be hitting the end. Give it some time! I love these shoes.
Adidas,5,i hate sneakers. anything clunky. these are the 1st ever name brand work our shoes i have ever bought. i would highly recommend. my expectations were exceeded 10 fold. fits like a glove but not tight. thin material nothing to big/chunky. a sleek slim fitting sneaker!
Adidas,5,"I hate tennis shoes - too bulky, look like clown shoes on me. These i love, light weight, lots of compliments. I can where these all day."
Adidas,5,"I have 3 pairs of this same shoe in different colors. Love this shoe, so comfortable. Order 1/2 or more size up so it’s easy to slip on and off."
Adidas,5,I have 3 pairs of this shoe!  comfortable and stylish
Adidas,5,I have 5 pairs of these- in different colors of course! Love them! Walked over 7 miles in them in Chicago with no foot or leg pain that day or the next!
Adidas,5,I have a bad knee and am not very athletic (yet) but have been trying to reach step goals daily for the past few weeks. Switching to these shoes have been very helpful in that journey so far. It feels like I have more support on each step and I am excited to keep pushing my goals.
Adidas,5,I have a hard time finding sneakers that are comfortable for me. I had gotten a pair from the adidas outlet a year ago and was pleased to find the other color options here. I will be ordering more!
Adidas,5,"I have a high arch so its difficult to get the shoe on.  Once its on, its awesome."
Adidas,5,"I have a lot of foot issues...pinched nerve, plantar fasciitis, and a plantar fibroid...blah...blah...blah. Shoes are important to me. I prefer not to wear sox around the house and this shoe is a perfect slip-on. Super comfortable. Good looking too. I also wear this for indoor rowing, so getting more colors today. Highly recommend!

When you first put them on, you will notice the seam on the side interior. By the time I was wearing them for more than a fitting, I don't notice it anymore at all. I do not think this is a running shoe, due to the comfort styling. More for floor work, rowing and just getting around."
Adidas,5,"I have a wide foot, medium instep, medium arch. I had difficulties with other slip ons but this one fit perfect.
It's my day to day shoe."
Adidas,5,I have always been worried about purchasing shoes online mostly because of my very wide feet. But these fit perfectly and are very comfortable. I would definitely purchase again.
Adidas,5,"I have an old pair and love them so much I bought another! I usually wear a size 10
But had to size down to 9. Super comfortable but I need more support for running or workout since I’m in my 50s"
Adidas,5,I have been looking at these for a while and finally got them.  So glad that I did.  They are super comfortable and fit wonderfully.  Adidas are one of my favorite running shoes and I am so thankful to have found these.
Adidas,5,"I have been to my podiatrist who had informed me of Adidas being the best sneaker for support. IT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE TRUE. If you have pain while walking or even standing due to feet issues, this is the sneaker for you. Im on my feet all day and it is proven to be true. My pain has subsided and I have no pain while standing or walking. Thank you Adidas!!!!😃"
Adidas,5,"I have been trying to find comfortable shoes for years now- multiple pairs later, these are the ONES! I can't get over how comfortable they are right from the start. I would definitely buy more pairs! I wear a 8.5-9 and ordered a 9. They fit perfect!"
Adidas,5,I have been wearing these everyday with any outfit!!! I love them!!!
Adidas,5,I have bought these shoes more than once and each of my kids have a pair. We love them
Adidas,5,I have bought these sneakers numerous times. They fit well and are comfortable.
Adidas,5,I have bought this shoe 3 times because I wear them out walking & jogging! They are so comfortable! And now I bought a pair for my daughter's birthday! She loves them!
Adidas,5,I have enjoyed these shoes and they fit perfectly
Adidas,5,I have fibromyalgia and have a hard time finding shoes that fit right and are comfortable. These were comfortable and fit great.
Adidas,5,"I have flat feet, and sometimes I get cramps in my aches. I have only worn them one day but they are just what I expected and fit my feet great."
Adidas,5,I have high arches and most shoes cause me pain if I wear them all day. These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I own. I like that they don’t have a tongue too.
Adidas,5,I have long narrow feet. Athletic shoes are rarely narrow enough for me. These are perfect. I love the comfort and the style and color. I did not have to break these in. Great shoes.
Adidas,5,"I have never had a pair of comfortable tennis shoe in my life and I am almost 29 years old.....I know hard to believe but it is true! I wear a size ten and do not have wide feet or anything like that, I would consider my feet to be very average, and these fit like a dream! I do not normally write products reviews telling someone they need to buy something, but if you are on the fence, I will tell you that I will buy these shoes in every color they are so comfortable and cute!"
Adidas,5,"I have never owned a pair of shoes like this so this review might be biased in favor of them, but they are insanely comfortable compared to every other shoe I own. The cloudfoam is amazing, and I love how the area around your ankle is more open to allow for better range of motion. I wouldn't change a thing about these shoes, they are fantastic. Would definitely purchase again in more colors. If I could wear these every day for every occasion I absolutely would."
Adidas,5,"I have never purchased Adidas prior to this, and have always been a Nike fan.  After ordering, and exchanging several pairs of Nike sneakers (due to being too wide), I made the swap to Adidas.  I am so happy with the switch, and found these to be extremely comfortable, and the perfect fit.  Overall, they are very lightweight, and I love the color!"
Adidas,5,"I have never purchased shoes online simply because of fit but these were exactly as listed. Right size, super comfortable and look as they do in the pictures. No complaints, received quickly and undamaged. Would purchase again; great overall product"
Adidas,5,I have not bought in two colors. so comfortable and no need to retie.
Adidas,5,I have nothing bad to say about the shoe. They fit true to size and have a great look to them. They are super light and extremely comfortable.
Adidas,5,I have one in almost every color. I absolutely love them. Best shoes ever. So comfy!!
Adidas,5,"I have only wore these to the store.. nowhere extreme. I think they are so cute, and a great price!"
Adidas,5,I have only worn these shoes a handful of times but hours at a time. My feet don't hurt after wearing them and I'm pleased with my purchase. I prefer these cloudfoam pure over my swift runs.
Adidas,5,I have plantar fasciitis and Birkenstocks were the only shoes that I could wear all day without any pain... Until I found these!!! They are very comfortable and I get tons of compliments. I still love my Birkenstocks but it's nice to have an option that's a fraction of the price.
Adidas,5,"I have probably worn these shoes everyday since I bought them. I love them so much. I run, sprint and walk without any shin splints or sore feet which were both issues in the past. I love how cute they are and I will probably be getting more colors because they are the sh*t."
Adidas,5,I have problems w heel pain and these cloudfoams will be the ONLY athletic shoe I'm going to purchase👍🏽
Adidas,5,I have purchased these in different colors but the white/white/black option is my favorite.  I wear them to my bootcamp fitness class and they have just the right amount of cushion to make my feet withstand all the jumping and impact activities.  They are easy to put on.  They wash up well.  I wouldn't use them for running but I do walk a few miles in them sometimes without any issues.  I often use them while running errands as well as they look cute with shorts or capris as well as work out clothes. Great price for a great product!!
Adidas,5,I have several pairs of these.  I've had surgeries on my feet and these don't bother my scars. I'm on my feet for 12-16 hour shifts at work. These are great!
Adidas,5,"I have some heel issues, and these shoes have saved me!!!"
Adidas,5,"I have these in 2 colors they are literally the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn. It feels like you are walking on air. I HIGHLY recommend these, and they are much cheaper than Nike's. I do find that my feet get super hot when I workout in them, but I think it's because I'm used to wearing the very thin Nike's. These are just so cute. I walked 20,000 steps in them one day and didn't feel a thing!"
Adidas,5,"I have these in another color in my normal size (8) and they are so tight! Took forever to break them in. Ordered these in 8.5 and they're perfect (maybe a little more room in the toes than normal, but overall fit is much better)."
Adidas,5,I have these on 3 different colors because I love them so much. They’re light and comfortable and fit perfectly.
Adidas,5,I have these same tennis shoes in black & I love them. They are very comfortable & light weight for walking.
Adidas,5,"I have these shoes in 3 colors...  Cloud, blue and midnight.  The fit is great - I were a 6 but I purchased 6.5 - this gives a little extra room to get on/off with ease but they don't feel too big.  My feet are comfortable and they are great for the day.  Honestly,  I don't think these would make a good running shoe - they do not have a super amount of structure or support.  I have running shoes and the sole - even lighter - are structured much better.  These are very light weight with a soft bendable sole.  There is great cushion and comfort and my feet feel good in them - the easy on/off is a plus !"
Adidas,5,I have these shoes in several colors. I bought this pair because my other pair got dirty at work.
Adidas,5,"I have these shoes in two different colors - lots of compliments when wearing them. They just good athletic and “good” on your feet. As for comfort, they’re great too."
Adidas,5,"I have these shoes now in 2 colors. I typically wear an 8 in most shoes, ordered an 8 in these and they fit perfectly. I bought these before our trip to Disney and wore them walking almost 10 miles around the park and never had any issues with these shoes! I love that you can just slip them on and off. I will probably order in more colors."
Adidas,5,I have this shoe in another color. I loved this color when I saw it and had to get it.
Adidas,5,"I have tried so many sneaker and because I could not find one that did not hurt my feet I have not wore sneakers in years.
After reading about the Adidas cloud sneaker I decided to try them. I LOVE them! Finally a pair the does not hurt my feet."
Adidas,5,"I have two pairs of these, one in the black and one in the white/black. I seriously love these shoes! They are comfortable and stylish and they are so easy to just slip on while chasing my little ones out the door. I haven’t used them to workout in but I wear them every other time when I’m in a hurry out the door."
Adidas,5,"I have very big feet. They are long and wide, these shoes fit great. It’s hard to find shoes that fit well and are also cute. I’m excited to wear these on vacation."
Adidas,5,I have walked miles upon miles in these shoes and love them. You want to wear on flat surfaces as you can feel rocks and debris if not.
Adidas,5,I have worn these almost everyday from working to shopping and actual running. Some shoes make my toes numb after awhile but these are so breathable and comfy.
Adidas,5,I haven’t bought shoes in years and these are perfect. Perfect to workout in and to wear with jeans. They are so so comfy!
Adidas,5,"I honestly find all adidas comfortable for my moderately high arches, but these are very comfortable. I cant speak for how they are for running but I imagine they would be fine. I go on long walks and they have served me well. They are infinitely more comfortable than any nikes I have worn. I tried nike free and these and much, much prefer these for any activity."
Adidas,5,"I just love these and I’m so glad I got them. So comfortable, I’d recommend them to anyone!"
Adidas,5,i just received my adidas cloudfoams today! they are sooooo comfy i don’t want to take them off! i’m on my feet all day at the hospital and these sneakers are like walking on air! lightweight and cushy. i love them! i also have a wider foot and they stretch and mold to your foot . i highly recommend
Adidas,5,I just received these shoes and tried them on and they are wonderful! They fit perfectly and are so comfortable that I ordered another pair in a different color!
Adidas,5,"I just received these shoes today and am very happy with the comfort and fit.  Reviews said to order your usual shoe size so I order a 8.5.  I am usually an 8 in street shoes.  These will make great walking and workout shoes because they are very light weight.  Not super supportive like running shoes, more for casual use, which is what I wanted!  The shoestrings are useful!  You can tighten them and tie them like regular tennis shoes, just less of them!  Not sure why other reviews differ.  Color/texture is close to photo."
Adidas,5,I just received these yesterday! I’m in love with these shoes! Definitely not a shoe for working out in but perfect for comfortable fashion!
Adidas,5,I just washed these sneakers this morning and waiting for them to dry. Don’t ever put sneakers in dryer .I love the shoe and light weight and color and very comfortable to wear. Only problems is when you wash them there seems to come with brown stain around the hole for shoe strings. But I still love the shoe
Adidas,5,I kept this pair as they were super comfortable and looking good. Love the color and the quality.
Adidas,5,I like adidas shoes it’s nice and comfortable
Adidas,5,"I like everything about these shoes.  I set out to find another pair of Adidas Cloudfoam because my first pair were so comfortable.  I wear them for work.  I work in Healthcare and I'm on my feet most of my shift.  These shoes are so lightweight, yet give the needed support.  My legs and feet fely so much better by the end of the day."
Adidas,5,I like how light weight they are. I feel like they are a half size larger than expected. I use them everyday for workouts and they are great. Very comfortable
Adidas,5,I like how lightweight the shoe is as well as it's comfort!
Adidas,5,"I like how they look and they fit good. I ordered a size 9 and it was true to size. If you have wide feet it might not be a good fit for you, I have narrow feet and it was a bit snug and not so easy getting my feet into these shoes, but they are brand new so I probably need to break them in a bit. The shoes are also flat/no arch support and if you have flat feet you should put some sort of arch support insert inside for more comfort. I have a big arch naturally and narrow feet so these shoes are just fine for me."
Adidas,5,I like it and it fits good. Exact size and doesn’t run big or small.. true to size
Adidas,5,"I like running, and I need to buy it for morning running. I have worn it for a few days and it feels great. They are one of my most comfortable sneakers. The color is very beautiful, the arch support is very good, the insole is not too thick, and the flexibility is very good. I like them very much, so I am looking for other pairs of different colors."
Adidas,5,I like that they are light weight and breathable. They allow your toes some movement so don’t get cramped. So far I really like them! I got them for more of an everyday tennis shoe. The memory foam insoles are awesome!
Adidas,5,"I like the air flow in the shoe, good for a day you want to look stylish but be able to walk around a lot in."
Adidas,5,I like the comfort of this shoe and how light it is.
Adidas,5,I like the fact that they are very light and that they are great for workouts
Adidas,5,I like the feeling it feels like you're walking on foam. They are very narrow so I wouldn't recommend for wide feet. They also have long shoelaces which I don't understand since you just slide them on. I've had two triple not the shoelaces just so I'm not stepping on them.
Adidas,5,"I like the looks and was informed by a family member this shoe is extremely comfortable.
I received the shoes and unfortunately the shoes are extremely wide for me and need to return."
Adidas,5,"I like the shoes but either wear 9 or 9 1/2.  Ordered the 9 but, needed 91/2.  Was going to return and then ask daughter about grand daughters size.  Gave them to grand daughter she loved the dark teal color and the fit of  the shoe.  I gave it a 5 star because it was just what I ordered and it is loved."
Adidas,5,"I like the shoes for walking, not sure about running bc they don't seem to have a ton of support. Weirdly kind of big, I got a size 6 as someone who's usually a 6.5/7 and I probably shouldve gotten a 5."
Adidas,5,"I like the shoes, but I have to wear light socks or they feel too tight."
Adidas,5,I like the way they fit and how my feet feel
Adidas,5,I like them. Will wear eventually  these are results submitted at try on
Adidas,5,I like these shoes they do not cut off my circulation to my toes after walking awhile and the top of my foot rubbed a little at first but now I don’t feel after couple times wearing and socks help
Adidas,5,I like these shoes. I walk a couple miles a day with the dog and these have been great.
Adidas,5,I like these shoes. They are very light weight and don’t offer a ton of support so they’re a new feeling to me. When running I feel as if my ankle may give out. But they’re so comfortable for every day walking. And I got an 8.5 but should’ve gone with an 8. Maybe that means they run a tiny bit big.
Adidas,5,I like this shoe and I strictly use it for rowing indoors - it's my indoor workout shoe and I don't wear it out so that I keep my house clean. It's fine. Personally as a former runner I find that this shoe is a little light and without another support for that kind of workout and I'm not sure it would be great for lots and lots of walking but it was a good deal for what I needed it for.
Adidas,5,"I literally forget that I'm wearing when they are on my feet!  They are so comfortable!  Easy to slip on if you use the tab on the heel to pull them on.  Very light!  Highly recommend, definitely worth the money."
Adidas,5,I live these shoes- it’s like waking on air- is that possible lol they do get dirty easily if you’re craZy like me and don’t stay away from crap on the floor. These are my second pair- that’s how much I like them
Adidas,5,"I live these shoes! I bought them specifically for walking around in Las Vegas, and they have been so comfortable!! 15/10 recommend!"
Adidas,5,"I loooove these shoes! I have white and black version, also. My profession has me standing, lifting, and carrying items all day. Think working out for 6-8 hours several times a week. They really help absorb a lot of the impact. I can even fit insoles in them for high arch support. My feet have yet to hurt wearing these shoes all day. Great buy for fashion and true function."
Adidas,5,"I love adidas shoes! These fit a little smaller than my other adidas shoes, so I thought that was odd. The one thing I don't love about these shoes is the cloudfoam inside doesn't go around the entire bottom of the shoe. When I first had the smaller size, 6, my toes went over the edge of the cloud foam, so it was a strange sensation. I got the 7 and now my foot fits perfectly within the ""border,"" but I thought it was strange that it doesn't go all the way on the bottom."
Adidas,5,"I love everything about this shoe. It's light-weight, comfortable and look great!!"
Adidas,5,I love how comfortable these shoes are really wish I would have ordered another pair at the price I got them at the other day . If you thinking about ordering these do yourself a favor and order more than one pair you won’t regret it
Adidas,5,I love how it’s a true fit to your shoe size. Also very comfortable and light
Adidas,5,I love how light and comfortable they are and can’t wait to wear them on my trip .
Adidas,5,I love how light these sneakers are. I can run and and don't feel like I have bricks on my feet. Comfortable with and without socks

Adidas,5,I love it
Adidas,5,I love it!! Actually the right size I wear
Adidas,5,I love it!! I use them to work and they’re so comfortable.
Adidas,5,I love it!! Use it to work and to workout everyday!!
Adidas,5,I love it!!!
Adidas,5,"I love it, comfortable and it slips on easy."
Adidas,5,"I love love love the shoes. So about a decade ago, for a few decades I wore size 9..
But once shoes started getting this kintted / breathable mashing on top my size shrunk down to a comfortable 8 1/2 with plenty of room before  I wear them. There is plenty of room after breaking them in. I love them. I also don’t wear socks. So it gives me more room. This is my second pair of these exact brand differ color. The First pair I have been wearing for six months. And never any socks. They have some how remained  odorless. I’ve washed them twice in the washer with hot water and they are as comfortable and as new looking as the day I bought them. These are great shoes and a must buy for any and everyone."
Adidas,5,I love love love these shoes! You can barely feel them on your feet. It truly is like walking on clouds.
Adidas,5,I love love love these shoes. They are SO comfortable and easy to wear. They look amazing. I’m obsessed. Would maybe go a half size down if running - I use mine for more casual everyday walking so I like them easy to slip on and off.
Adidas,5,I love love these shoes ao comfy and support
Adidas,5,I love my Adidas. Soft and comfortable and absolutely weightless

Adidas,5,"I love that these shoes can slip on and off without tying, but they stay in place without slipping. This is my second pair and I love them"
Adidas,5,I love that they're easy to slip on. Super comfortable and supportive.
Adidas,5,I love the cloudfoam to run on!
Adidas,5,I love the color and the ease of slipping them on and off. Very comfortable walking shoes.
Adidas,5,I love the color of these. Great sneakers. Easy to get on and off. Great support.
Adidas,5,I love the color usually I am a size 5 but this was too small
Adidas,5,I love the color! Super cute!!! Really fun design! Fits TTS and are super comfortable. (Not a ton of arch support) The shoelaces are SUPER long - which I found odd for a shoe that doesn't NEED laces. I will probably switch them out but it's not that serious :)
Adidas,5,I love the comfort and support of these shoes.
Adidas,5,I love the design and got so many compliments. Best of all these are very comfortable.
Adidas,5,I love the fit and how light they are to wear...... and fantastic they are for walking in!!!!!!!!!

Adidas,5,I love the high back and the soft support. Awesome color and slipping them on is super quick!
Adidas,5,I love the look and very comfortable
Adidas,5,I love the look of these and they are very comfortable. The material is breathable and easy to wash. I did not notice any shrink from the washer and I let them air dry. So far I’m very pleased with my purchase.
Adidas,5,I love the look of this shoe as well as the ease of putting on.
Adidas,5,"I love the look, the fit, the feel.  I'm using these to run, to walk and to just look good with some of my clothes."
Adidas,5,I love the looks of them and fit.
Adidas,5,"I love the seamless design and weight of these shoes.  Interested to see how they hold up as the mileage increases, but they feel amazing.  I also appreciate the limited opportunity for blisters due to the lack of seems and roomy, but not too roomy, toe-box.  I’d buy them again."
Adidas,5,"I love the shoe itself, but these ran quite small."
Adidas,5,I love the shoes! I should have got a 8.5 but the 9 fit fine with sox
Adidas,5,I love the shoes. I use them for work because I walk a lot. I plan on buying another pair.
Adidas,5,"I love the shoes. They are perfect for me. Inwas tired of “bulky” tennis shoes. These are light, comfortable and stylish!! Love them! My daughter has a pair too!"
Adidas,5,"I love the style and the fit - they're casual and comfortable. I would recommend changing the laces out, because the ones that came with them are very long."
Adidas,5,"I love the style. The fit was true to size. It's light and comfortable. The inner soles could be more padded with memory foam, but it's sufficient. I was looking for something that was light like my Nike free shoes."
Adidas,5,I love the support very comfortable I use mine for work I’m a bartender.  They do run a bit big.  I wear a 7.5 and I purchased an 8.  I just wear a heavier sock.
Adidas,5,"I love the way they look and feel! However, I wish I would have gone down a half a size. For me they ran a little big!"
Adidas,5,I LOVE THEM
Adidas,5,I love them
Adidas,5,I love them . Was able to work a full 12 hours the first time I wore them!
Adidas,5,"I love them tbh great price , great fit."
Adidas,5,I love them they are so comfortable i wear them everyday for work and im on my feet all day. they are a great buy.
Adidas,5,I love them they’re so cute and very very comfortable I could of went for a size half down if I wanted to (6.5) but the size 7.. (my normal size) fits comfortably too so I’m ok with a little room! :)
Adidas,5,"I love them, so cute and comfy"
Adidas,5,"I love them, they are super comfortable! I wore them for the first time today to work (I’m a Medical Assistant) and didn’t feel the burning and soreness after work today as I work all day on my feet. They provided really great comfort all day."
Adidas,5,I love them. Bought a size smaller
Adidas,5,I love them. Super comfy and very lightweight.
Adidas,5,"I love them. They're less clunky than my running shoes, but still super comfy. I wear them nearly every day just chasing my kids around."
Adidas,5,I love these adidas cloudfoam shoes so much! Perfect fit for my petite feet! I hate shoes that are super wide at the toe and make my feet look huge. These are the perfect size and are so light! My feet feel great after wearing them all day. I now have them in 3 colors!
Adidas,5,I love these Adidas Sneakers!  Super cute and comfy.  Perfect for running errands and maybe weight training.  I wouldn't buy them for running or walking for exercise but they are great for casual use.
Adidas,5,I love these adidas they are so comfortable and lightweight and cute. They fit perfectly and I usually wear a 7 1/2 or 8 but I got an 8 just to give me a little bit more room because I wear 2 pair of socks sometimes for work
Adidas,5,I love these but before you buy them at least a half size small. If you buy your regular size they will feel big and they will stretch in time to be too big.
Adidas,5,I love these cloud foam shoes! These are great slip on shoes! Great for a 12 hour nursing shift.
Adidas,5,"I love these for general roaming around town, but if you need a lot of support for running or working out, I would not wear these. They are so sporty and comfy though and I am finding I am wearing these more throughout the day than my normal flip flops. I want to get the pure white pair when they are in stock."
Adidas,5,I love these- I always order 2 pair. Very comfortable and stylish. Fits as expected. Long lasting
Adidas,5,I love these kicks! The price was reasonable and the package showed up a day before I expected them. Fast delivery. I am pleased.
Adidas,5,"I love these light weight, breathable shoes. Whenever they go on a good sale I buy another pair. If you’re between half sizes, I recommend sizing down. I wear a 7-7.5, and the 7 fits best. The 7.5 was a little big (but I still was able to wear them just fine). There’s not a lot of tread on the bottom, so these are probably better for walking rather than running on a trail."
Adidas,5,I love these my new favorite shoe cute with Jean's or yoga pantsuit of shoes bother my feet I haven't had any trouble with these .should love another pair in a different color
Adidas,5,I love these shoes ! They are so comfortable and love the color. The only thing I didn’t love is the back of the shoes. It took me some time to get use to getting them on
Adidas,5,I love these shoes and have gotten lots of compliments on them. I bought them for an upcoming trip to NYC and they've been really comfortable the few times I've worn them. I didn't plan on working out in them and the one time I did they weren't great for me but that wasn't really why I bought them anyways.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes and I want more colors
Adidas,5,I love these shoes and this is my 2nd pair! Very comfortable and I can wear them all day! These are the first gym shoes I've found that I could wear since I broke my ankle!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes as casual wear!  They are very light and extremely comfortable.  I wouldn’t wear for running but great for casual wear.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes because they’re comfortable.  I needed a basic sneaker for walking and comfort as I have flat feet.  My daughter had a pair and I’d wear them from time to time. Finally, I bought my own and am glad I did. Well worth it."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes but I don’t wear them at the gym as there isn’t a lot of support for running but I like them to do errands around town
Adidas,5,I love these shoes comfortable on my feet
Adidas,5,I love these shoes especially for the price. I bought them for every day chasing around my toddler and light work outs. I have a wobbly ankle and if I were doing lunges or a lot of jumping I would probably want a show with a little more support. I recommend these!
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes for everyday wear. Not something you want to run in, but they’re cute and great for general wear."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes for just running around in... they are super comfortable and they look cute too! They do run big though... I normally wear an 7.5-8 and I am a 7 in these.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes- I have 4 pairs!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes I have them in all colors. Comfortable and cute.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes I ordered a second pair within weeks of the first!  One pair is for everyday and one is for special occasions, lol. The shoes are so comfortable and so cute. I love how they easily slip on but are not loose. I usually wear a size 8 but needed a 7 1/2 with this shoe. I even washed (gentle cycle) and then air dried a pair and they held up fabulously. You will not be disappointed in this shoe!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes so much! I have large feet, and getting old so shoes have made a huge difference in my comfort and ability to do things with out pain. I can’t recommend enough. The backs are a little soft so have to untie but would never change that"
Adidas,5,I love these shoes super comfy and easy slip on. I would order again! Fast shipping as well!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes they are my faves and I also have them in white and gray.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes they are so comfortable and so easy to put on and off I will be getting me another pair
Adidas,5,I love these shoes they will go great with jeans with a casual outfit and for the gym. I wore them for leg day today and they were great because they were flat enough do you have a good balance. Overall awesome shoe I bought and color Cloud foam pure and it’s such a versatile color I highly suggest buying.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes!  comfortable and soft.  I use them for ""every day wear"" vs. running, so I am unable to comment on their durability, but as far as a cute tennie goes, they/re spot on."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes!  I have been telling my friends how comfy they are.  I hope that Addidas starts to make some additional colors in this particular style.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes!  I normally wear 8.5 they were a little snug, exchanges for a 9 and they feel like slippers!  So comfortable!"
Adidas,5,I love these shoes!  They are so comfortable and so cute.  I want them in every color haha!  Highly recommend.  I found that they fit true to size.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes!  They fit great and I love how light they are.  Looking forward to many walks in these shoes.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! After reading the reviews I was nervous to get damaged shoes or two that were completely different sizes but that wasn’t the case. They are absolutely perfect. I never had a sneaker that didn’t have a true tongue so it was weird to get used to that but once I wore them more it didn’t bother me at all. I walk in them a lot, they are my go to shoes for the zoo, aquarium, park, etc. They are very comfortable and definitely worth it. I’ll probably order them again! If you do get a damaged shoe, Amazon makes it really easy to just return them so I wouldn’t let the negative reviews keep you from at least trying them."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! By far my best workout shoe purchase!
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! From the first day I've worn them, they have not hurt or caused any blisters. I was also worried about being able to get them on since the tongue is attached. I have had no issues, they are so easy to pop on and go! I ordered 8.5, and I typically order that or 9"
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! Great price. Very light weight and they’re like walking on air!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! However my personal trainer said no lol these are great for walking etc not a personal training session because the arch support isn't there.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! I am a runner, and would not recommend for running but  they are great kick around shoes!"
Adidas,5,I LOVE these shoes! I have them in 3 colors and I just ordered a new pair of gray ones because I wore the other ones out! They are extremely comfortable and do not require a breaking in period. It’s like walking on a cloud. I’ve run several races in these as well. Highly recommend!
Adidas,5,I LOVE these shoes! I have them in black too. They fit perfect and true to size.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! I highly recommend for people with wide feet! My only complaint is that I wish the shoes had more arch support.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! I just recently had a baby and have started working out again, and these are super comfortable!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! I purchased the “white/white/black” pair. I normally wear an 8, but based on other reviews, I decided to order 1/2 a size down and got the 7.5. They fit perfectly. I use them for running errands, bike rides, and working out (I do mostly cardio/running on a treadmill and the elliptical/stationary bike). I haven’t used them for running on trails/paths outdoors though. They’re super comfortable, light weight and stylish too. BEST PART?! I GOT THEM WHEN THEY WERE ON SALE FOR $30!"
Adidas,5,"I LOVE these shoes! I saw them in store and tried them on, but found a better price here. great for working out and running errands. I have wide feet and they are snug."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! I use these for my daily dog walks and after a little short of two years they are finally wearing out. I will be getting another pair of these. They are comfortable for the amount of walking I do and I feel they have good support being that I have high arches. Plus they are super cute! All in all I am pleased with the quality of these!
Adidas,5,"I LOVE these shoes! I wear these to the gym for spinning, boot-camp class, and weight-lifting. They are very comfortable and are stylish enough to wear around town when I'm running errands."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! I’ve had them for about 3 months and they are so comfy and cute. I will def buy a second pair!
Adidas,5,I LOVE these shoes! My feet no longer hurt. They are super lightweight and I am not distorting my feet trying to hold them in place.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! My husband has a pair really similar and they go with everything! It's very light-weight and comfortable! The laces are a bit too long and, quite frankly, just got show, but I think they would look strange without laces."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! Ordered them for work (ironically I’m an Amazon delivery driver). They are so comfortable and breathable.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! So comfortable and soft. I do think the size might be half size too big as they feel bigger than my sketchers of the same size. But they are amazing shoes and you feel like youre walking on air!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! So comfortable! Literally feels like walking on a cloud. And they’re so cute to wear for a sportier outfit look! Obsessed!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! So comfy. Got so many compliments on them.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! So cute and super comfy
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! So light and comfortable with or without socks. I don't think they would be good for running or working out, but for everyday life they are really good."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! So so comfortable! Nice clean look!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! Super comfortable and I love the style!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! Super comfortable!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! The colors blend well. The shoe is light weight and very comfortable. I am very happy with this purchase.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! The cream color goes with everything! The only bad part is how easily the dirt shows. But that comes with the lighter color shoes.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! These Adidas fit and feel great! I got the grey, next time these go on sale, I'm definitely buying more colors!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They are breathable, light and I love the memory foam. Don’t feel tight at all. And they are just so cute. I’ve received lots of compliments on the shoes :)"
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They are comfortable and I can easily fit my orthotics inside them without losing space for my foot.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They are comfortable and the color is great!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They are lightweight and comfy! I ordered a 6 but they were a little big so had to exchange them for a size 5 1/2.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They are lightweight, a little snug to slip on but very comfortable. I wore them right away and didn’t have to break them in at all. Highly recommend."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They are remarkably lightweight and comfortable. The material “breathes” - the air circulates so well that my feet never feel hot. The padding is generous and the color is vibrant. I get tons of compliments wearing these. Regarding size, I tend to wear thick socks so I purchased a half size up (I’m a 6.5, purchased size 7). The fit is ideal with heavy socks - they’re roomy with thin ones. I’d say they’re true to size. Great buy - would definitely purchase again."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They are so comfortable and light. I would buy them in another color.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They are so comfortable to run in. I thought they were “okay looking” online but I didn’t care because I wanted them for work out purposes. BUT...they are much cuter in person and look so nice on. I love them and the price...couldn’t beat it. V happy with my purchase, would purchase again."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They are so comfortable! I've bought them twice now. I will say that they only hold up for about a year and that's with daily use in the summer months and only occasional use the rest of the year. The bottom of the shoe wears out eventually and will leave you feeling like you're walking right on the ground. But, I did buy them twice and am considering purchasing a third pair as my current ones are a bit worn."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They are so comfortable. I work at a dentist office and am on my feet all day rushing around. They are so nice!
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They are so comfy and have a lot of room. I think they are a bit bigger, but actually I like that, just depends on your preference. If you don’t need more room or don’t like that then order half a size down from
your normal! I’ve gotten many compliments on them!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They are so lightweight that sometimes I feel like I just have socks on with no shoes. They are super comfortable! The sizing is a little off -- I normally wear a size 8.5 in Adidas, but I had to get an 8 in these shoes. I highly recommend these shoes!"
Adidas,5,"I LOVE these shoes! They are the perfect everyday, running errands shoe. Light weight and comfortable."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They came super fast and were exactly as the picture showed as well as true to size. I am an elementary school teacher and have a fast pace life with baby and family and these are the best shoes for all those jobs!
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They fit perfectly and are comfortable even when I wear them all day. They look good, too."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They fit true to size. I bought my normal size. I’m a long-distance runner and I can use the shoes for that because they are so comfy and the sole isn’t too big and bulky. Definitely recommend!
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They were delivered to the wrong address and I had to wait another week, but the shoes are perfect!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They’re a little big, but that’s my own fault. I typically wear an 8 so I would size down maybe a half size. I actually found these in store and liked them, but decided to order from Amazon. . . Should’ve tried them on. But they aren’t SO big that it’s worth a return. I love the way these look and how comfortable they are - oh also there’s no separated tongue which I didnt notice until I put them on if that bothers you."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They’re perfect for running errands and long days walking.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They’re so comfortable and stylish. I get compliments all the time.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes! They're absolutely beautiful but besides that they are super comfortable.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! They're very comfortable and cute. I agree with the other reviews that day they don't offer much support. However, if you're just wearing them to go to the gym and run errands, they're okay."
Adidas,5,I LOVE these shoes! This is now my 2nd pair just a different color. If I could I would order every color they have. They are light and are very comfortable.
Adidas,5,"I LOVE these shoes! Ultra lightweight, super comfy! My go-to faves!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! Very comfortable, fit perfect, and really cute."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! When I first put them on I wasn’t so sure, they’re extremely light weight but after wearing them for a few days I have no complaints! While I wouldn’t say these would be great for actually running, I find them perfect for casual wearing or while I’m at work. Super cozy and really cute!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes! When I noticed that my exact size was on sale in this color, I could resist, but they are totally worth the full price! They are incredibly comfortable. They seem to be holding up great, and don't slip easily, if that makes sense.

I don't do anything high impact in them, but they are great for walking, housework, and stretching. These are now my daily shoes."
Adidas,5,I LOVE these shoes!!  They fit great!  I read reviews before hand and they do run a little big.  Depending on the brand of shoe I run between and 6-7.  Everyone said to order a half size down and I did.  They fit perfect!  I have another pair of adidas shoes that are a 7 so I got a 6.5 and are super comfy.  The show doesn't have a tongue that is separate from the show so a thinner sock will make it easier to get on and off.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes!! I’m a 9 and the 9 fits great. I also bought the white I love them so much. Great for running errands and looking fashionable, not for you if you plan on running marathons!"
Adidas,5,I LOVE these shoes!! So light and they slip on easily. It feels like I’m not even wearing shoes. They fit true to size. I plan on getting another pair or two.
Adidas,5,I LOVE these shoes!! They are some of the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned. I love that there is no tongue and they are super easy to get on and off without untying the laces. And they look great on!
Adidas,5,I LOVE THESE SHOES!! With different brands/materials my size varies. Im typically a 9.5 but I ordered these in an 8.5 and they fit like a sock. Thank you!!!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes!!!
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes!!! They aren’t really “work out” or “exercise” quality shoes. BUT for dressing casual for shopping, errands, or watching your kids sports games these are fantastically comfortable!!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes!!! They came in original Adidas packaging, I am a size 7 and they fit just right! The color is just like the picture and they are really comfortable! I'm happy with purchase!"
Adidas,5,"I LOVE THESE SHOES!!!
Ok, I’m not into sports, so I don’t know if they are good for running, etc. However, I am on my feet all day for my job and these are the most comfortable AND fashionable shoes!!!!! I hate tennis shoes because they always make my foot look so bulky- but not these! They make my foot look small- they have a smaller look to them but with more comfort that any pair I’ve had before. I always have to add comfort insoles to my shoes, but not with these!
They do run large. I had tried them on in-store so I knew which size to buy. I normally wear an 8.5 in tennis shoes, but in these I’m a size 7.5! Big difference if you aren’t expected it. I bought them from Amazon because they were $20 less than in-store.
I’m about to buy a second pair from Amazon in another color! :)
I have literally had a stranger stop me to tell me they loved my shoes and ask about them! Another note- they are actually slip-ons. The laces make them look like typical shoes, and they can tighten them some to adjust for comfort. But you can still slip them on and off with the laces tied without affecting anything. Plus- they don’t stretch out from slipping them on and off! They are designed so well and fit like a glove even though they are slip-ons.
I can’t say enough good things about these shoes!! I don’t have any negative things to add! Get the shoes!!! Maybe try them on at a store for size, but for the price, get them from Amazon!"
Adidas,5,I love these shoes!!!!
Adidas,5,"I LOVE THESE SHOES!!!! These shoes are the best I have ever bought. I am huge sketchers fan but after I saw these on amazon I showed them to my boyfriend and he said buy them. I said, but I’m a big sketchers fan, I only buy sketchers shoes. So I bought sketches and adidas (these shoes ) and thank God I bought them. They are amazing. So light, so comfortable, very stylish, looks good and you can walk in them all day and feel comfortable. I think from now I’ll buy only Adidas. People buy these shoes. THEY ARE THE BEST"
Adidas,5,"I LOVE these shoes, but I had to order 1/2 size down.  I usually wear a 5.5 in shoes, but a 5 fits much better in these."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes, great support and feels good all day., plus they look great"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes, I have been wearing them all day everyday and they are super cute and comfy. They are a pretty coral color, not orange. I'm a 7 or 7.5 but usually a 7.5, and 8 in running shoes. The 7.5 fits great."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes, I workout in them daily. They’re lightweight and are holding up to the daily use. I like the stylish color and fit as well."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes, my husband bought me a pair for my birthday so I ordered another pair in a different color. They are very comfortable and light. Good for workouts too. Recommend!!!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes, they are super comfy, but run a tad on the long side, could have sized down a 1/2 size. NOT alot of support and I would never really call them running shoes, as they don't give tons of support. BUT they look great with leggings and shorts as an every day shoe!!!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes, wore them to run errands. Super comfy and true to size."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes.
Adidas,5,i love these shoes.  They are very comfortable and feels almost like you are walking on clouds.  Fit was just as expected.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes.  This is my second pair this year; I wore the first pair out.  This pair I sprayed with repellent to hopefully avoid some of the dirt light colored tennis shoes inevitably get, but even if it doesn’t work, I won’t care much.  They are slip ons!  The laces are just for show and don’t do that much.  Probably not great for people with wide feet, but mine are narrow so it’s one of the few slip-on shoes that fit.  They are as cool may as slippers."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes.  Wore my last pair out
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. Cute and comfortable
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. I am not sure they will last a real long time but if I get 6 months I’ll be happy because they are so comfortable.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. I bought two pairs!
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. I had a pair of the adidas slides that had the cloudfoam in them and they were the most comfortable shoes I owned. So when I saw these shoes had the same material, I had to try them. I had just started working full time shifts after being out of work for a while because of an extensive surgery. My shifts are long and are all standing/walking. The first month back was awful because I was wearing old work shoes...when I started wearing these shoes I noticed a complete difference and significant decrease in foot pain within only a few days wearing them. They are amazing and now that I have them completely broken in they are literally the best!! My feet don't hurt at all anymore than maybe a slight ache some days. Nothing like before! Must buy. I got the beautiful maroon color. No pictures can do the color justice. Simply must see in person. Absolutely reccomend. Will be re-purchasing."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. I have another color. I wear them daily. They are comfortable, but not a lot of side support. They are lightweight and airy. Just wish support was a little better"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. I have been eyeing it for a while and finally got it for a good price. Nice, Durable, Fits as expected & Very comfortable."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. Such a great price for them. I go running in them and they work great, not as good for weighted workouts but thats just because of the support."
Adidas,5,I LOVE these shoes. The fit was on point. Great for the Gym =)
Adidas,5,"I LOVE these shoes. They are comfortable and supportive, super light weight. Great value! My only complaint is I have a preexisting injury to my right Achilles’ tendon and wearing these shoes for too long severely aggravates it. I’m not sure exactly why because on my left foot I forgot I’m even wearing a shoe, but my right tendon is SCREAMING after too long. If I didn’t have this injury these shoes would be PERFECT."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They are light weight and super cute. They are exactly what I was looking for in a slip on walking shoe. I have also received many compliments on them from friends and family. I did order a 1/2 size up so that slipping on the shoe wouldn't be a struggle.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They are lightweight and feel great on my feet. They are a beautiful black with a hint of color coming thru.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They are my new go to pair to where out everywhere. Very comfortable and easy to wear for working out or just going out and about.
Adidas,5,"I LOVE THESE SHOES. They are NOT a running shoe, make no mistake. They’re a great street shoe for running errands, shopping, a long walk. I would never run in these shoes for their lack of support throughout the entire shoe, but especially through the arches and ankles.

They’re cute and look good with  skinny jeans or leggings and a hoodie."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They are really light weight and comfortable.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They are so comfortable. I wear them to work out in. They are just a tad bigger than I thought they would be. I might order a 6.5 instead of 7 when I get them again.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They are so comfy and great for walking or working out. I wear them when kickboxing and they are perfect!
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. They are so light and comfortable. I have had foot pain for years due to bone spurs and plantar fasciitis and these shoes are amazingly comfortable. Normally I wear a size 7, but they were a tad too short. The 7 1/2 fits perfectly."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. They are super light weight, have good support and they look really good."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They are too cute. I bought them for casual wear as well as work out shoes. I gave these shoes 1 star for support. I don’t think that’s what they’re designed for. They are very soft and comfy though and I am so glad I got them
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They are ultra lightweight and so comfortable. Slip on and fit is perfect.
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They are very comfortable and the price was great!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They fit perfect and are light and very comfortable. YAY!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They fit perfectly and are so comfortable for my daily walks.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. They slip on easily, very light and comfortable. I will say they are slightly wide on my feet, but it doesn’t make them slip off or anything so I’m ok with it. Not sure how well they would hold up for running, but I love them for comfortable shoes to walk around in."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes. They’re a bit big and stretching out as I use them.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. They're cute and comfy and the color is so nice. I personally feel I should have gotten my true size, an 8, instead of sizing up a half size."
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. This is my second pair. I'm currently pregnant, so they're great for slipping on and off and stretch with my swelling feet! Super comfy, not stiff, and no need to ""break-in."" Will likely buy again and again. Very satisfied!"
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes. This is now my third pair. I have the black ones, the lavender ones & now these. I loveee how they are stylish, look good with really any bottom & COMFORTABLE! It also I feel has ankle support."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes; they are so comfortable.  Great shoe and price!
Adidas,5,I love these shoes; they are so light weight and comfortable.
Adidas,5,"I love these shoes; they’re my latest addiction. They feel like heaven on my feet!
For reference: I usually wear a size 8 or 8.5 (I think my feet are on the wider size) and while the 8 fits beautifully, I have another pair that’s 8.5 and they fit me fine too."
Adidas,5,I love these shoes;They are very comfortable.
Adidas,5,"I LOVE these shows! I have a wider foot and these are perfectly comfortable! No need to even break in! They’re super cute and sooo comfortable! I’m a 6.5 and got a 6.5. Can’t say enough about these! Thank you for
all the previous comments! They helped me know which size to buy :)"
Adidas,5,I love these shows. These are my go to shoes. I wear them practically everywhere.
Adidas,5,I love these slip-on sneakers. Super lightweight and stretchy.  Plus a stylish look.  These are great for around town use.
Adidas,5,"I love these sneakers for athleisure outfits. They are lightweight, breathable, and comfy. I love that they slip on and have a high back. However, these are NOT workout shoes. They don’t have great arch support and they don’t hold your foot very well if you run or walk fast."
Adidas,5,I love these sneakers!
Adidas,5,I love these sneakers! And are very comfortable.
Adidas,5,I love these sneakers! They fit great and I love not having to adjust the tongue! There isn’t one! They slip on and are so cute and comfortable! I have them in white and black and love both!
Adidas,5,"I love these sneakers, I wear them for errands and on weekends. They look good with shorts and athleisure wear. With the Prime day pricing, I got them for a steal!  They are super comfortable--  I wear them with and without socks, depending on how long I'll be out."
Adidas,5,"I love these sneakers, they’re very comfortable and definitely good for running. I have flat feet so I find these to be exceptionally comfortable."
Adidas,5,"I love these sneakers. I have this style in 2 different colors and plan to buy more. They are so comfortable in the gym or just to wear as casual shoes. I usually wear a size 8, but purchased these in a 7.5 and they fit perfect. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for a stylish yet comfortable sneaker."
Adidas,5,I love these sneakers. I'm on my feet all day at work and these keep my feet happy.
Adidas,5,I love these sneakers. So comfy!!
Adidas,5,"I love these soo much! Super comfortable and true to size might be a bit big but I don't mind.  My new fav running shoe, buh-by nike!"
Adidas,5,"I love these tennis shoes so much! They’re the best! I run long distances, sprints, I do CrossFit and basically all exercises. They’re perfect and I need to buy more."
Adidas,5,"I love these! Bought two different colors. So comfy for working out, walking, everything. I’m wearing one of my pairs every single day now. When these wear out I’ll buy another pair. And such a good price for the product. Definitely recommend!"
Adidas,5,"I love these! I use them for strength training, conditioning in a gym, and walking around town and for walks in nature. They’re pretty! Shoelaces are easy, shoes is easy to get on and off."
Adidas,5,"I love these! I was a little skeptical when I received them and they aren't tie-able, but they're super easy to slip on and fit great, even when I work out. Although I don't run, I'm not sure if they'd slide up and down running, but they're great walking and on the elliptical! And super cute, probably getting them in another color"
Adidas,5,I love these! I wore them while traveling and they were great for 20k steps a day! They’re comfortable and cute. I don’t think they would be good running shoes because there isn’t enough support for impact. But for walking and kicking around they’re great!!!
Adidas,5,"I love these! So comfortable and perfect for running. They don't hold up very good in wet weather, it'll soak right through, but that's with any shoe like this. These are beautiful, comfortable and just what I was looking for."
Adidas,5,I love these! The Adidas Cloudfoam are the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever had. I bought a pair of Nikes at the same time and have barely worn them.
Adidas,5,"I love these! They are far cuter than I expected. I usually wear an 8 so I ordered a 7 1/2 since sneakers usually run a bit larger - they fit fine, but I probably could have ordered a 7. Happy with the purchase!"
Adidas,5,I love these! They are perfect. Be ready to receive all the compliments on your new shoes!
Adidas,5,"I love these! They are super light, and easy to slip on. I highly recommend these."
Adidas,5,"I love these! They are very comfy. I was looking for a casual sneaker to wear on the weekends/to run errands in. I wasn’t looking for something to run miles in or do a full gym workout in.
Many reviewers said they “were too big” I almost got a size or two smaller because of that but I’m glad I didn’t. I’m a size 8 and ordered a size 8. They fit! BUT because of the stretchy fabric I might have been able to get away with a 7.5 but I definitely won’t be exchanging for a smaller size. The 8 is good. Hope this helps!"
Adidas,5,"I love these! They’re so comfortable and light!  Feel good to run in and I get compliments on them a lot.  I did get a 6.5 even though I’m normally a 7, and I’m glad I did.  They run a bit large."
Adidas,5,I love these! They're cute and comfortable! I walk alot and these are great and don't hurt my feet at all!
Adidas,5,I LOVE THESE!! They’re SO perfectly comfortable-great support yet feel like the best slippers! I want more colors!!
Adidas,5,"I love these, I have bad feet, and they’re sooo comfy. Like a cloud. So cool-looking."
Adidas,5,"I love these, my kids gave me a hard time with mixing brands (Nike with Adidas) so I finally broke down and bought Adidas for myself.  I am typically a Nike shoe person but these are very comfortable and I wear them on a regular basis!"
Adidas,5,I love these. I don't think they would be so great for jogging but for general use they are top notch.
Adidas,5,I love these. They fit perfect. They are ultra light and look terrific. Highly recommended
Adidas,5,I love these❣️ It’s a little tricky for me to order shoes online due to very high arches. Also my foot gets wider at the toes so I need a wider toe box. These are really perfect for me right out of the box. I walk every day and so far these are comfy and no need to suffer through breaking them in. I’m disabled & walk with a cane so I need practical. Needs met!!  😎
Adidas,5,I love theses shoes so much I bought 3 pair for me and for my kids they love them as well!! They are very cute and super comfy!!!!
Adidas,5,"I love this brand, this is my 5th pair of this style shoe, just a different color. I am a medical professional so im on my feet all day and these are literally a life saver. No back pain. No leg pain. Very comfortable and they are slip on!!"
Adidas,5,"I love this comfy shoe. Not only does it look great, but it feels good on my foot. I feel like these run about a half size bag."
Adidas,5,"I love this pair of sneakers 👟, they are so comfy, soft, feel good, I already ordered the same for my daughter and the peach one!  They run a little big!"
Adidas,5,I love this shoe so much I have other colors!!  It's a great tennis shoe that's light and comfortable.  True to size!!
Adidas,5,I love this shoe! This is the 2nd pair of the same ones I bought. I am a nurse and I wear them at work for 12 hours they stay comfortable. They are also easy to wash and dry out quick in the sun. I also wear them for running and have never felt like they aren't supportive enough
Adidas,5,"I love this shoe, just bought it to replace old adidas.  Great fit, great comfort"
Adidas,5,I love this shoe. It’s comfy and not bulky at all which is what i was looking for. I needed a sneaker that will pair well with cute dresses for a chic/sporty look.
Adidas,5,I love this shoe. This was my second pair. They are so comfortable and really good on my feet. I'm a receptionist for a busy Dr.'s office. I'm on my feet most of the day. My feet are never tired. I wish the off white/beige would come back. They are the cutest! #lovenyadidas
Adidas,5,I love this shoe.. very comfortable!
Adidas,5,I love this show. I also bought a pair in black
Adidas,5,I love this show..so comfortable..I walk a few miles a day in them. I usually wear a size 9 but bought 9 1/2  to be roomy for walking. Perfect!
Adidas,5,I love this sneaker. Not my first pair. The pattern is awesome. Super compfy!
Adidas,5,I loved everything about this order. Fast and free shipping. Shoes just the way I expected. & the shoes alone are awesome for work.
Adidas,5,"I loved how comfortable they were.
I use them a lot for street walking, trails I tend to use footwear a little sturdier.
Very stylish and cute."
Adidas,5,I loved it!
Adidas,5,"I loved the first pair of these shoes I bought. This order was supposed to be the same...name, size, etc.  But it isn't made in the same way.  It is tight on my instep and across the toes."
Adidas,5,"I loved them!Very comfortable,good quality.I usually wear 8,5 but ordered 8.It was super!"
Adidas,5,I loved these shoes. Bought them for a month long European vacation. Was able to pack and wear. Extremely comfortable and durable. True to size.
Adidas,5,"I loved these. Bought them before my Disney trip and was worried I was going to have to break them in. They were super comfortable from the start, especially with all the walking I did on my trip. Considering buying a second pair in another color."
Adidas,5,I loved this sneaker so much i bought 3 pairs!
Adidas,5,"I LOVEEEEE these! I wish I’d switched from Nike a long time ago. Seriously, no blisters bread comfort!"
Adidas,5,"I mostly just got these for comfort and to style when working with clients.  I'm a personal trainer.  I haven't used these to work out in yet.  I typically do high intensity workouts with my running shoes.  These would be great to strength train in, especially on arm day.  I'm not sure how much support they would give for more active workouts, but my daughter has a pair that she used to run in, so I'm sure it depends on the individual.  I'm too old to worry about twisting my ankle!:)"
Adidas,5,"I needed a pair of shoes for working out and walking. These shoes are perfect - comfortable, easily washed, light weight. I loved them so much I bought a pair in black."
Adidas,5,I needed new shoes for work and read alot of good reviews on these. I work in a hospital and walk around for over 12 hrs. And I really like these. So far were them for almost a month and I have no complaints. They do fit a tad bit large. I ordered a 7 cause I am a 7.5 and read they run big. They sure do. A 6.5 would have been perfect!
Adidas,5,I needed new walking or running tennis shoes. these do not dissapoint.
Adidas,5,"I needed some work out sneakers and I give this one a try, it was comfortable and light,good for walking and running too."
Adidas,5,"I needed support, these have been my go to shoes all summer!"
Adidas,5,I never buy shoes online because I have a hard time finding a style that looks good and fits right but these are great!
Adidas,5,I never write reviews but these shoes are too great not share. They are incredibly comfortable and so cute. I had been looking for a pair of sneakers that I could wear with jeans and these are perfect!
Adidas,5,"I normally wear a different brand and , but last summer my daughter suggested I try these.  I stand all day at work and these shoes are very supportive and my feet did t seem as tired as usual.
Loved them so much I ordered these recently, which are the same as the  pair I enjoyed all last summer."
Adidas,5,"I normally wear a size 8. I was reading the reviews everyone said to go a size down, so I ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfectly. I love these. Harder to slide on over heal but they are so comfy and cute."
Adidas,5,I normally wear an 8. I should’ve ordered a 7.5. Love the shoes. Comfortable and cute.
Adidas,5,I ordered a 7 they are a little roomy but great! Love how they sit in my foot & super comfy. I ordered the blue color its awesome
Adidas,5,"I ordered a 7, and they were a bit big. I’d suggest a half a size down.
Other than that, this sneaker is top of the line. Very very comfortable, good support and has a nice stretch to them. The white and gray color is awesome!
Great purchase, I recommend!"
Adidas,5,I ordered a half size smaller than I normally wear because of the previous reviews and they were too small. Sent them back and ordered my normal size 7 1/2 and they fit perfect. True to size.
Adidas,5,I ordered a size 5.5 as I read that some said they run small and the 5.5 fits perfect.  The shoes are so much lighter than I expected they were going to be and they are extremely comfortable.
Adidas,5,I ordered an 8 and can wear 7.5 in some brands so this may fit normal and may be just a little bit large either way it is still super comfortable! I love these shoes! Great for running!
Adidas,5,I ordered my regular size and it was too big. Sent them back and then ordered a size smaller and they fit great! I love how comfortable they are!
Adidas,5,I ordered my usual size but had to exchange for a half size smaller. I love them
Adidas,5,"I ordered the white pair in a size 6. I wear a consistent 6 in all other brands including other activewear brands. These shoes came and are almost about 1/2 size too big. They are still comfortable and okay but there is a little more space between my toe and the top of the shoe than I am used to. The quality seems great, but I wouldn't suggest these for working out or running. Because there isn't a functioning tongue, the laces can't really cinch and it is more of a slip on shoe. The cloudfoam padding isn't as squishy or dense as the Adilette sandals are which was a little disappointing but they are still comfortable. I would recommend these for running errands, casual wear for day to day, or walking. I would not suggest these for hiking, running, jumping, or any very active wear."
Adidas,5,I ordered these a half size smaller than I usually wear and they fit great. Super comfortable and stylish. I love the look with no tongue.
Adidas,5,"I ordered these because I recently got a job at a hospital to work on the O.R floor and they are EXTREMELY comfortable! They look like the product shown above, they feel amazing. I also wear these to town when going grocery shopping or while running other errands so I can be comfortable. I definitely recommend them if you stand on you’re feet for long periods of time, work out, or you are always on the go. I’m going to buy another pair soon in a different color!"
Adidas,5,I ordered these shoes as a walking shoe for traveling. So far they are perfect! They are extremely comfortable; I feel like I could walk for hours in them. Based on other reviews I ordered a half-size down (8 instead of 8.5) and they fit perfectly.
Adidas,5,"I ordered these shoes because i have the same shoe in a different color and I love them! I will say that the color was a little different than expected but not enough to make me dislike my purchase, quite frankly, I might like this color better anyways."
Adidas,5,I ordered these shoes to do at home work outs since the gyms are closed. They arrived quickly and were perfect. I love the support and how comfortable they are!
Adidas,5,I ordered these to replace an old pair of comfortable shoes that gave me years of good use.  I fully expect these to be a great replacement.
Adidas,5,I ordered up half a size and they are a perfect fit.  The most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned.  I ordered a second pair in a different color.
Adidas,5,I originally bought my normal size but it was too big so purchased half a size smaller and fits great. Very comfortable
Adidas,5,"I originally bought these for my daughter, and since we wear the same shoe size, I tried them on to make sure they’d fit her. I ended up loving them and ordered a pair for myself!"
Adidas,5,"I originally bought these to replace my workout shoes (which involves a 2-mile walk), but I can tell the sole is pretty thin. So I plan to use them for everyday, grocery shopping, go to the zoo, hanging-out-type-use instead. They're still really comfortable, just maybe not ideal for for heavy use."
Adidas,5,I originally ordered a 10 because that’s what I wear in heels and flats. I had to reorder for a size 9.5 hopefully that will fit better. The 10 women’s was too long and left way too much room for my feet. The show was light and very airy which I like. My daughter has a pair also and she loves them. They are not bulky and the sole is very comfortable.
Adidas,5,I own 3 pair of these all different colors of course. They feel amazing and look amazing. Love love love them.
Adidas,5,I own 3 pairs and seriously they are great ..I am usually and 8 1/2 but wear a 9 in Adidas..
Adidas,5,"I own 3 pairs of these shoes...They're reasonably priced, hold up great, and are super comfortable!"
Adidas,5,I probably could have Went down a half size but these are so cute and comfortable!
Adidas,5,I purchased a size 6 for my 12yr old in light grey and white stripes. A size 5 for my 16yr old daughter who will never truly attest to the comfort both have fallen in love and say they are comfy...my 12yr old daughter is active af so we go thru shoes...I plan on treating myself soon!
Adidas,5,I purchased first pair of these Adidas shoes in a brick/mortar store and I was worried that they might be of a different quality ordering from Amazon - Nope!  Same great quality... BUT LESS EXPENSIVE than the pair I bought in the store.  Thinking about purchasing another pair in case the style gets discontinued.
Adidas,5,"I purchased these for a vacation and am so glad I did. I walked 12 miles in them on day one of our trip and my feet were tired but also comfortable! I did get a tiny blister on the top of my ankle where the tongue rubbed above my sock, but considering the amount of walking we did this is pretty darn good!

They are stylish and cute and not too bubbly (I hate the new style where the sole of the shoe bubbles out around your foot). They are classic and so comfortable, easy to slip on and off at the airport, and super stylish!"
Adidas,5,"I purchased these for an upcoming trip as I wanted something light weight that could be worn with a variety of outfits. I think I found the perfect shoe. Based on reviews, I ordered a sz6 and sz6.5. I normally wear a sz7 in regular shoes and sz7.5 in running shoes.  The sz6 fit perfectly so definitely size way down.  Can’t wait to wear them."
Adidas,5,I purchased these shoes just days before leaving on my honeymoon. I had no time to break these in and wore them for 9 days straight. We walked several miles each day on our honeymoon and they never once hurt my feet.  I love these shoes.
Adidas,5,I purchased these sneakers to wear on a Disney vacation.  They were extremely comfortable for the miles and miles I walked! I would highly recommend.
Adidas,5,"I purchased these to wear to Disney World.  I wore them for 13 hours a day and my feet never hurt!!!  Awesome price, too!!!!"
Adidas,5,"I read many reviews about this shoe 👟. When I googled best running shoe for women this shoe was on the list, so I thought I’d give it a try. Well, this shoe is actually one of the best I’ve tried. It’s light, fits well and provides great cushion and form when running. I absolutely love this shoe and will buy more colors! If you’re looking for a great running shoe, this is the one ☝️! Highly recommended!"
Adidas,5,"I read reviews which said sizes ran a bit small, so I bought half a size bigger — I wear an 8.5 and ordered a size 9.  Bigger size fits perfectly!"
Adidas,5,I read the reviews before buying.  I have been walking almost 3 miles daily and fell in love with the comfort of these sneakers.  Love.  Love.
Adidas,5,"I really like the way these fit. Very lightweight, stretch with your foot and is so stylish! I wear them with everything."
Adidas,5,I really like them!
Adidas,5,"i really like these shoes for work! they are super cute, but i have pretty sensitive arches so these aren’t the comfiest without inserts (no shoes are for me though lol) but they are still really comfy nonetheless! i do a lot of walking & haven’t had any problems with these yet."
Adidas,5,"I really like these shoes, there so comfortable and cute.  It was almost 20.00 cheaper than Kohl’s and shipping only took a day."
Adidas,5,"I really like these shoes. I bought my first pair at an Adidas outlet in Portland, OR, while on vacation. I’ve worn them for a year now and they still fit really well and are my most comfortable shoes to wear anywhere. I was very excited to see them on Amazon so I could buy another pair for less than any I saw online. The new pair is as good as my first one. I wish I could get more in different colors. I definitely recommend them."
Adidas,5,I really like these shoes. I originally got an 8 and the were supper comfy but a tad to big. Sent them back in exchange for a 7.5 fit was perfect and the price was great as well. I like the fact that you can literally just slip in and out of them. I don’t usual wear these kinds of shoes but I would definitely buy them again.
Adidas,5,"I really like these shoes.
Very light weight and comfortable.
Cute too!"
Adidas,5,"I really like these! I needed a new workout shoe and was trying to avoid going to a store to get them. I have wide feet, so I'm usually pretty leery about ordering shoes online instead of going to the store - but I couldn't this time. So I tried these. They fit perfect and are comfortable for working out. I even find myself wearing them to run errands in - so I'll probably need to get another pair soon!"
Adidas,5,I really like this shoe! HOWEVER- just beware that the color for the ice mint is NOT anything like the picture shown. They are definitely a bright sea foam green color. I still love them! but nothing like the picture.
Adidas,5,"I really like this shoe! Its very comfortable and attractive. I have big feet so athletic shoes usually make them look bigger. Not these, they’re slim and good looking"
Adidas,5,"I really like this shoe, and I’m not a huge fan of athletic style tennis shoes.  Fit is true to size, style is cute, comfortable, and the shoe is lightweight.  I bought them for this spring....can’t wait for spring to get here!"
Adidas,5,"I really like this shoe. It's super lightweight and comfortable. I use them for the gym and have run in them also. They do run large, I'm typically a 9 in sneakers or 9.5 in heels or dress shoes and my feet run a bit wider, and I returned the 9 I originally ordered for an 8.5. They are great for wide feet.  Would recommend."
Adidas,5,I really love how light they are and they are super cute. Only thing that kinda bugs me is the tongue of the shoe rubs.  Fits true!
Adidas,5,"I really love how light weight they are! I use these for running errands, and moderate walking. These aren’t the shoes I would pick to run in or do a workout class with, but I love them for being out and about!"
Adidas,5,I really love the shoes I want to wear them all the time. I got them just for running but I find myself always wearing them because they’re so comfortable. The style is really nice as well and they make my wide ankles look thin so there’s a plus. I would definitely recommend.
Adidas,5,"I really love these shoes but today, the 2nd day of wearing them I noticed a gap in the shoe and the sole.  Pretty disappointing.  Hope they last awhile."
Adidas,5,I really love these shoes! I work at the front desk of a hotel where i work 8 hour shifts where i stand the whole time. The sole of these shoes are so soft and comfortable that it makes the standing not so bad! I havent run or worked out in them as i ordered them mostly just for my job and being comfortable while standing! Id recommend ordering in your exact size as they fit perfectly! I also get lots of compliments on them!
Adidas,5,"I really love these shoes.  They fit great, and are not tight at all on the top, but also not loose. Just right. They are very comfortable, I love the cloud foam. I’m not sure how they would hold up to running for dedicated work outs, but they are great for me to slip on to go for a walk, jog, or other outdoor activity. Plus, they look really cute!"
Adidas,5,"I really love this shoe!! I wear inserts for my foot and I have thicker socks for comfort so the shoe fits great, but without them I can see how this shoe would be loose around the foot and ankle. But overall I LOVE the look and feel of them"
Adidas,5,"I really love thumbs shoe. I bought it for my treadmill, but they are excellent for outdoor too. They are light and cute to just wear for errands too!"
Adidas,5,I received a pair of these shoes (in black) as a gift. I stand 9-10 hrs a day and have had a lot of foot pain. These shoes are like little miracles. My feet do not hurt anymore. I loved them so much a bought another pair within a month. I highly recommend these to anyone who stands for long hours.
Adidas,5,"I received my sneakers yesterday and I’m wearing them for the first time this morning. I am very please with how they fit! I am a 9.5 and they are true to size. Extremely cute, and I don’t feel like I’m going to have to work very hard to “break them in”. Loving my new work sneakers!"
Adidas,5,I received these a day earlier. I put them on and fit perfectly. They’re comfortable and very light. Thank you.
Adidas,5,I received these as a birthday present after I put them in my amazon wish list. These are so comfortable! They feel nice and I would say fit true to size. I want to order more in a different color!
Adidas,5,"I received these shoes in the mail last week and have been really, really happy so far! I have yet to wear them to run in, only walking long distances but they are honestly like walking on air. They also look very cool and are extremely comfortable."
Adidas,5,"I received these sneakers very quickly and was happy from the minute I opened the box. They are lighter than air, they fit beautifully, they look great and I wore them all day the first day without a single minute of discomfort. I definitely recommend them and hope to buy more in different colors!"
Adidas,5,i recomend this shoes 100%
Adidas,5,"I recommend getting a half size smaller than what you normally wear. Otherwise, these are great shoes. Very comfortable!"
Adidas,5,"I returned these. I liked the look, but there was very little support/cushion. The name of these infers that they are for running - definitely not a running shoe."
Adidas,5,"I rolled the dice when purchasing these online - I prefer to purchase my shoes in person but was unable to do so due to current circumstances.  I wear a 6.5 and purchased a 6.5.  These fit nicely and are really comfortable.  The one think I’m not real thrilled with is the toe of the shoe is somewhat elongated, or at least that’s how I feel when I wear these.  I’m 5’1 and wear 6.5 shoe size - when I wear these I almost feel as though the shoes look big on me.  Perhaps a size 6 would have fit better.  All in all, these shoes are truly comfortable and will get me through my summer workouts."
Adidas,5,"I rounded up a half size, as that’s how it seems most sneakers run, and it was perfect.  These are super cute and very comfortable. Love that you can slip on without tying"
Adidas,5,I run a lot on the street and a school track. These shoes are the greatest shoes I've found. They are very comfortable and have a great arch for me.
Adidas,5,I run with these everyday and they are comfortable.
Adidas,5,"I saw these shows at a store and fell in love with them! I didn’t think to look on amazon and once I found them they were almost $20 less that the store price! Authentic, everything I expected and soooo comfortable to walk in!"
Adidas,5,"I selected these as a comfortable slip on shoe with adequate support. They absolutely do that for me. The uppers are very flexible and stretchy, the shoes are incredibly light and they slip on very easily. I can wear them all day in comfort, as opposed to my bare footed preference. But those same attributes likely make them unsuitable for a hard core runner or cross trainer."
Adidas,5,I seriously love these shoes. The price is great and they’re so easy to slip right on for the gym.
Adidas,5,I seriously love these shoes. These are my second pair
Adidas,5,I should’ve ordered a size smaller BUT they are the most comfortable shoes  have I ever owned!  They also match with almost anything!
Adidas,5,"I sized a half size up (as I do for Nike's as well). They fit perfect, super comfy, and very cute! I get a lot of compliments on them too."
Adidas,5,"I sized up half size and happy i did, way more comfier that way when im hiking and walking down hill. the comfiest pair of shoes ive ever owned. unfortunately my dog got to them by the second time wearing though, so i will have to invest in a new pair eventually."
Adidas,5,"I spend a decent amount of time on my feet, and needed a pair of shoes to help my feet feel less angry. These pair of Adidas do the trick! I come home, and I don't have to deal with throbbing feet. Best decision buying these. Highly recommend!"
Adidas,5,"I started walking five miles a day recently. I quickly wore out my shoes I had worn for a couple of years.  I googled ""most comfortable walking shoes"" looking to replace them. First one that came up were my favorite current cloud foam Adidas. I was not surprised and although my current pair were simply wore out because of the mileage I put on them I ordered a second pair. I have terrible feet with bunions and can hardly wear any closed in shoes. The cloud foam Adidas are the best! No need to break in just put them on out of the box and you're ready for a mile mile walk."
Adidas,5,I swear these are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. I can wear them all day at work and my feet don’t hurt at all.
Adidas,5,"I think I’m on my 4th or 5th pair since the pandemic started which may seem like a lot but I’ve been walking a ton since there’s nothing else to do. I’m averaging I’d say roughly 250-300 miles per pair so I’d say that’s pretty good.
Some of my walks are obviously very long (I’ve done a few solo walking half marathons for “fun”) and these shoes are a dream! They are so incredibly comfortable and I don’t have to worry about blisters. Clearly I love these shoes as I’ve bought quite a few pairs.
FYI I do not run at all so I don’t know how they’d be for that but for walking at a decent pace/distance, they’re great!"
Adidas,5,I thought 9.5 M would be perfect but it is still pretty narrow. A 10 would be too big for me. I want to love these shoes so bad but my wide feet are making it hard :/
Adidas,5,"I took a chance on the reviewers and went a size down in these and they fit perfect! My normal size would definitely have been too big. Another plus is that they are so cute and slimming! They don't make my size 10 feet look bulky at all. Don't hesitate, buy these!"
Adidas,5,"I tried adidas brand shoes for the first time and I am in love. The shoes were very comfortable. They are okay for working out, but there isn’t much grip on the soles of the shoes so if it is wet, you slip. The shoes gave me the much needed support in my arches as well."
Adidas,5,I truly.love these shoes they are like walking on a cloud I have a bunion and they work great doesn't hurt my foot at all and can't beat the price for Adidas awesome
Adidas,5,I typically wear 8.5 but sometimes have to order 9 in other brands but the 8.5 fit perfectly. These are very comfy & have a lot of cushion. I wear them all the time & they’re stylish & my feet never ache after a long day.
Adidas,5,"I typically wear a 7-7.5 in adidas shoes. I read reviews that said these shoes ran a little large, so I went with a 7 and they fit perfect! The last pair of adidas that I bought off of amazon didn’t have the cloud foam sole like advertised, but this particular pair do have the cloud foam. Very good quality and super comfortable! Would def buy again."
Adidas,5,I typically wear an 8 in a sneaker which is what I bought.  I should have purchased an 8.5 since I walk 5 miles a day.  They don’t pinch my toes but I don’t think I have enough room.  But these are extremely comfortable.  I will buy again.
Adidas,5,i use forcwalking and gym.  fits well. flexible and very comfortable
Adidas,5,I use it for light running on concrete 2 miles. I’ve had it for a month and it’s still looking good. P.s I only run almost 3 times a week.
Adidas,5,I use them for jogging and so far so good. They are confortable and look amazing.
Adidas,5,"i use these all day as a PTA. i have severe hyperextension in my knees and often shoes give my knee or heel pain. these are great, no more pain!"
Adidas,5,"I use these at the gym. They are comfy and look fantastic.  I have 3 pairs, different colors.
My last pair, I wore in Vegas for 5 days.  All I can say is wow! My feet and back did not hurt like it did when I wore sandles or any other tennis shoes"
Adidas,5,I use these for cardio workouts and they are great! Very soft and flexible. Only complaint with cardio is with mountain climbers the will slip off due to the laces being so far up. Would definitely recommend though!
Adidas,5,"I use these for indoor workouts, not sure how they would hold up for outdoors. Super soft and comfy!"
Adidas,5,"I use these shoes at the clinic and i’m on my feet a lot. it’s doesn’t do much for support, but it’s insanely comfortable. I like that it’s a slip on shoe and the laces are for show"
Adidas,5,I use these shoes for track walks and runs. I absolutely love how light weight and comfortable they are.
Adidas,5,I use these shoes to do cross fit training. They are soft and flexible enough to work on a cushioned gym floor. Also work well with interval training!!
Adidas,5,I use these to work out in and they are comfortable. I also always get compliments on the look
Adidas,5,"I use this at work and it's perfect. A little note, the tongue comes up pretty high to where it was rubbing into the top of my foot, so breaking them in the first day was uncomfortable. It made the top of my feet and ankles swell. But after a day or two, they softened and now feels great."
Adidas,5,I use this product for work
Adidas,5,"I use to run marathons in the past and had a hard time finding comfortable tennis shoes that were great for wide flat feet. I seem to twist my ankle easily if I wear the wrong type of sneakers. These are great for just about everything I do and it does not put an uncomfortable pressure on the walls of my feet.

This is a trendy style and I love wearing them with my tennis skirts. They are not oversized looking and I love how you can just slip them right on. It does feel like a cloud and they incredibly lightweight!! They are true to size."
Adidas,5,I used these Adidas for walking . Had problems walking far distance. But now I can go all day and be 🙂
Adidas,5,"I usually hate sneakers, and this is finally a pair I like! I've had these shoes for a few months and I think they're an incredible deal. They're comfy and stylish. Great for everyday wear and exercising. I was worried that the soles wouldn't be supportive enough, but they work great for me (I work out and walk in them every day and run sometimes, but am not a runner--I think serious runners probably should not and would not use these as running shoes). I got these after my physical therapist recommended them--they looked great on her and she wore them to work and said they stayed comfy all day. The one thing to keep in mind is that I think the soles will wear out after a year or so of heavy use--which is normal, especially at this price point. Mine are already starting to wear out, so I could see buying a new pair in about a year. And I will definitely be buying a new pair of the exact same ones!"
Adidas,5,I usually hate wearing sneakers but these are so light and comfortable and breathable. The memory foam sole is perfect and I tell everyone to buy them. I even ended up buying them in a second color.
Adidas,5,I usually only wear brooks tennis shoes and these are even better!! So comfortable I’ve had them for over 2 months and working in medical field on my feet I needed good shoes! Will definitely buy more!!
Adidas,5,"I usually wear 7.5 and I got the same size in these shoes and they fit perfectly, slightly loose but they are fine once I wear socks. Really comfortable and they look great!"
Adidas,5,"I usually wear a 5.5 and I got these in a 6 (women’s) they are a tiny bit big but not like the other shoes I purchased elsewhere on Amazon, unlike those I can actually wear these without them sliding off my feet. Very very comfortable great for working out and bartender life."
Adidas,5,I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 depending on the shoe. I bought a 7.5 in these which is great but if I planned on never wearing socks a 7 would have worked too. They look & feel great & best of all no blisters!!
Adidas,5,"I usually wear a 9.5 in sneakers and brought that size and they fit perfectly. They are very comfortable, easy to slip on, and above all nice looking."
Adidas,5,"I usually wear a size 6, but sized down to a 5.5, and they fit perfect. I love that they're slip on. I wear them mostly as athleisure and not to workout because they have the support I would need."
Adidas,5,I usually wear a size 6.5/7 and I got a 6.5 they fit great and I get a lot of compliments as well! Very comfortable too but wearing them for work for 5 hours my feet do still hurt! But I do work in a wear house. Running with them are ok as well!
Adidas,5,I usually wear a size 7 but I think this runs small.thay were really tie.Probably a half number above will be good.I return them.If you like attention this are the pink shoes you want.
Adidas,5,"I usually wear an 8.5, but always get a 9 in sneakers. The 9’s were way too big so I sent them back and got my usual. They are perfect and so comfortable. Very soft, flexible and lightweight. I can put them on without untying them which I like, but they may be too loose around the ankle for training or hitt workouts. These are great if you’re prone to ingrown toenails too."
Adidas,5,"I waited a couple of weeks to write this review, and despite what other reviewers have said about them not being good for exercise, etc, I completely disagree! I’ve worn these for yoga, jogging on trails, going to the gym, and even just around the house because they are so supportive and comfortable! They fit like a glove, came in perfect condition, and are better than what I could’ve hoped for! In the picture with them in the box, there is a stain (from the jogging on trails:( ) and I plan on cleaning them to get it out! Other than that, they are my favorite new workout/ everyday activity shoes! I’ve recommended them to friends/ family and am still receiving compliments for them! 11/10 would recommend, and I’ll probably come back and buy in different colors too!"
Adidas,5,"I waited a while to write this.  I wanted to break them in before making any judgment.  I have to say I love them.... not at first tho.  They are super light weight and the foam soles have a very different feel to what I’m used to.  The tongue / back is higher than  i’m used to and because they are pull ons, this was a bit “rough” at first.  But, after about 1 week of wearing them, they were broken in and I couldn’t imagine wearing other casual shoes.  I have severe rheumatoid arthritis and have had 2 hip replacements along with various other back and shoulder issues- I say this because I cannot speak from the work-out or running perspective.  Walking is my exercise and these are absolutely perfect.  The foam soles are cushioned and feel amazing even after walking all day.  I know that you’re not going to be able to return them after giving them the chance they need- but from where I stand- it’s worth breaking them in."
Adidas,5,I walk 45 minutes a day in pavement. These hold up fine for about 6 months. In my opinion that’s great. I do NOT recommend running in these. They are cute enough that I’ll wear them on a day trip. You can wear a semi-cute outfit without sacrificing comfort. I’m in my 20’s and love these and my mother-in-law in her 50’s wears and likes these as well.
Adidas,5,I want to buy more pairs! I have a wide bunion on the front of my foot and the flexibility of this fabric is exactly what I need in a running/walking/anything shoe.
Adidas,5,"I wanted a casual sneaker that was neutral, comfy and affordable and this is all three! After reading through the reviews I decided to go with a size 9. I wear a size 9 to 9.5 depending on the brand. (I have a different pair of adidas in 9 which are slightly close to my toes but felt like my foot slipped forward in the 9.5) I have slightly wider feet and these shoes fit snug on my feet, but not too tight. There is plenty of room in the toe box and I’m glad I didn’t size up. These don’t have a lot of support but I think they’re really comfy and perfect for running errands/short walks. So happy!"
Adidas,5,"I wanted a cushy sole - I had some cheap shoes from walmart so I ordered these at twice the price expecting more from addidas.
Not.  Get a flip-flop or go to walmart"
Adidas,5,I wanted a lightweight shoe primarily for walking/some light jogging. This works great and is comfortable and lightweight. Looks great too.
Adidas,5,I wanted a new pair of shoes for spring and summer because ALL of my other ones are black. I live in Washington where it rains 99% of the time so white isn't smart year round but I brought the white/grey and they are just like the picture and SO cute on! They also have some memory foam at the bottom and it makes them so much more comfortable to wear. 100% will buy another pair. Love this style!!
Adidas,5,"I wanted to find a pair of shoes that are comfortable for walking, easy to slip on and stretch to allow for the bunions i have by my big toes. I typically have to purchase wide width and an 8.5. I read the reviews and decided to order the standard with size 8. They fit and feel wonderful!!! Most comfy teenies i have ever purchased. They do not rub and allow ventilation. Love them and will buy again!!"
Adidas,5,"I was a little afraid at first, but the shoes fit perfect and they are comfortable. Very true to size, looks exactly like the pictures."
Adidas,5,"I was a little concerned about buying an Adidas brand, not sure if it would be a knock off, it is not.  I have another pair that I purchased from a retail store, these are exactly like them.  I am very happy with this purchase and told others about purchasing from Amazon for their Adidas products."
Adidas,5,"I was a little nervous about ordering these because I got them on sale for $20, but they are legit, and my favorite sneakers now. They are so comfortable.  If you wonder if you should get them, you should."
Adidas,5,"I was a little worry about the size of this shoes because I read a lot of reviews about to fitting or have to choose either a smaller nor bigger size, but for me that I'm 7 in this kind of shoes, they fit perfectly! They are really comfortable and now that i'm staring to run again, they just feel great on me. Super happy with this purchase!"
Adidas,5,I was going to return them only because I have too many shoes. But decided to keep them and glad I did! So comfy!! 5 stars!
Adidas,5,"I was happily surprised! I always struggle with running shoes because they are either too tight, unsupported, or the back rub against my heel and gives me blisters. These are absolutely wonderful. I got the pink and it is beautiful, super bright and eye catching. Definitely worth the money compared to ones that were a little cheaper."
Adidas,5,"I was hesitant on purchasing these shoes on Amazon. My first pair of cloud foam Adidas shoes I bought from a department store and loved them. There were a lot of reviews saying these shoes are fake and that’s not true at all. The tag inside these shoes say “Made in Indonesia”, my other cloud foam shoes say “Made in Vietnam” thus there a small differences in the tags/packaging. However, Adidas has factories in numerous countries including Indonesia and Vietnam. These shoes fit/feel the same way as my first pair. Noted- these shoes are not meant to wear if you walk 10+ miles a week. But that does not mean they are not good sneakers. I’ve had mine for about 8 months and worn them to theme parks, outdoor malls, etc. and haven’t had any issues with wear/tear and they still look great. Most comfortable sneakers I own & I will definitely buy more!!!! Hope this review helps!"
Adidas,5,I was looking for a comfortable sneaker to run errands in and these are perfect for that. I work out 6 days a week and would not recommend for working out. They are light weight and although supportive not enough to run or exercise in. Also don't wear them when it's raining. But I love them !
Adidas,5,I was looking for a shoe I could walk around for 2 days at Disneyland and universal studios. I could wear these for 16+hours and my feet weren't achey and sore. I loved them so much I bought them in the lighter color also!
Adidas,5,"I was looking for some new, everyday sneakers and thought I'd give these a try.. They are amazing!! Very cushiony and comfortable!! Definitely true to size."
Adidas,5,"I was on the hunt for good ""treadmill"" shoes for so long! These are so light and very comfortable. I purchased another pair. Highly recommend!"
Adidas,5,I was skeptical about purchasing a shoe online but it was worth it. They fit comfortably and it is like walking on a cloud. Will definitely buy another pair once these wear down
Adidas,5,I was so nervous on how they would fit but they are perfect i got a size 9. I like my size 9 sneakers to be snug and they are beyond comfy and snug.... I haven’t worked out in them yet but I’m sure I will have no problems!
Adidas,5,I was wicked hesitant to buy sneakers with out trying them on but these are above and beyond expectations. I really like them.
Adidas,5,I was worried they wouldn't fit so I went up to 9.5 I could have gotten a 9 and been fine! Overall they are extremely comfortable!
Adidas,5,"I wasn’t sure what to expect with these, but as soon as they were delivered I threw them on and started my work out. They are extremely comfortable and easy to put on. I might just have to buy some in other colors, too!"
Adidas,5,"I wasn't paying attention to the shoes at first, I thought they looked great and didn't realize I bought women's shoes, but since they were extremely comfy, and light I said to hell with it and decided to keep them. Granted they were a bit tight at first but when I broke them in, these shoes have been one of the best I've worn for running. I'm thinking of ordering a second pair just for the hell of it!

Update: I ordered a second pair"
Adidas,5,"I wear 7 1/2, could have got an 8, but sticking with 7 1/2."
Adidas,5,I wear 7 1/2-8 depending on the shoe. I got these in 7 1/2 and there’s about 1/2 inch of room but overall very comfy and light. I work 12 hour shifts and they’re durable. I will get another pair in a differently color soon 😁
Adidas,5,"I wear a 10-11, or a 10 wide. I ordered 11s and they fit. :)"
Adidas,5,"I wear a 6, ordered a 6 ans they fit perfect. They are exactly what I wanted. My daughter already has a pair of these. We paid double what I paid for mine. Exact same shoe! Very happy!"
Adidas,5,"I wear a 6.5 and had to return for smaller size 6. Have only worn once for working out, but no complaints."
Adidas,5,I wear a 6.5 in Adidas (7-7.5 in other brands) so make sure you know your size before ordering. The price was fair (and less) than box stores. Quick arrival. Super cute shoe and comfortable
Adidas,5,I wear a 6.5 or 7 usually and I feel like i should have ordered a 6. The 6.5 fits but the shoes are so soft they feel slightly big but not so much that i can't wear them. Absolutely LOVE the shoes though. They are so comfortable
Adidas,5,I wear a 7 and they were a tad bit big. But after braking them in a little they felt ok. I love them. Soooo confortable! And perfect pricing!
Adidas,5,"I wear a size 7 and bought a size 7. Fit perfectly and they are very light weight and they are so comfortable.
Wearing to Disney, will update after experience."
Adidas,5,"I wear a size 7, but the shoes are too big"
Adidas,5,I wear and 8.5 but I ordered an 8 since they slip on and they fit perfectly.  These shoes are very comfortable. I have the same shoes in white but the white is much harder to keep clean.
Adidas,5,"I wear at home,  but cute enough to wear out. Shoe strings are long, wish it was a toggle to tighten. I like them very much."
Adidas,5,I wear at work for comfort which requires lots of walking and standing.
Adidas,5,"I wear either a women's 8.5 or a 9, I got a size 9 and it fits perfectly! I work on my feet all day and walk about 12 miles while at work and I feel they support my feet well!"
Adidas,5,I wear the shoes for running around every day
Adidas,5,I wear these shoes everyday at work sometimes for 18hrs a day! They’re very comfortable and easy to put on every morning just slip them on! I have multiple pairs of these in diff ent colors they’re amazing!!
Adidas,5,"I wear these shoes solely for boxing and I love them so much. They are really light weight and don't have a a lot of treads, which makes it easy to pivot. I have worn holes in the bottom of this pair and I am getting ready to order another."
Adidas,5,"I wear these shoes to work and as my casual sneaker. I really love them. Not too bulky, slim and looks good in my comfy clothes. I wouldn’t run in these tho. Not my type of running shoe!"
Adidas,5,"I wear these tennis shoes about every day, walking around my campus. They fit very well, although they are tighter than the shoes I normally buy. Still like them though!"
Adidas,5,I went down a full size in these. They are extremely comfortable and work well for the miles I walk on my treadmill.
Adidas,5,"I will buy this shoe over and over again. Love the color, love the style, light weight, and so comfortable!"
Adidas,5,"I will never buy another pair of sneakers in my life. I have ever person in my family wearing these because they are really the most comfortable pair of sneakers ever, and I don’t really like sneakers!!! Buy these they will change your life."
Adidas,5,I wore these almost everyday the last trimester of my pregnancy and they were so comfortable when nothing else was. Go a 1/2 size up though.
Adidas,5,I wore these for regular around town and school shoes. They are too light/not supportive enough for an active shoe. Very stylish and goes with many outfits.
Adidas,5,I wore these most recently for a long day at the Mall of America. So many miles walked and my feet weren't tired afterwards. I would definitely recommend for a reasonably priced simply sneaker.
Adidas,5,"I wore these out as soon as they came and walked for about 3 miles that day! No pain, no blisters, very lightweight and comfortable. Also very cute and fit sung. Definitely going to get more!"
Adidas,5,"I work as a package handler and spend alot of time standing and walking. I bought these shoes to help with my flat feet. the foam cushion under my heels helps so much,that theyre not throbbing like they use to."
Adidas,5,"I work in a hospital,long shifts on my feet constantly, these shoes are beyond comfortable.  Compared to my favorite nike shoes they are just as comfy and half the cost!"
Adidas,5,I work in Customer Service and I bought these to wear to work! I absolutely adore them. They are cute and comfy as can be!
Adidas,5,"I work in the dental field and am always looking for new shoes. I am constantly on my feet and need something light and durable.
These shoes fit like a dream and feel like there in nothing on my feet. They are designed with people in mind. They slide on so well."
Adidas,5,I work in these shoes. All day they keep my feet happy and dry. I'm literally about to order another pair
Adidas,5,I work on my feet ten hours a day with no breaks so I tend to go through a lot of shoes. These were so comfortable after switching from my last worn pair. And definitely helped the leg pain I was experiencing. I liked that they were higher up at the heel because it made them much easier to slip on.
Adidas,5,"I work out regularly. I have lots of work out shoes but these are my favorite go to shoes. Supportive, comfortable, light weight and stylish. What more could one want!? People are always commenting that they love my shoes when I wear these....I own several colors."
Adidas,5,"I work retail and I bought these for work, I've worn them around town the last couple of days to ""break them in"" but they are so comfortable and form-fit that breaking them in wasn't even really necessary. I plan to buy a few more in different colors!"
Adidas,5,I work with horses and I wear these shoes in the barn during morning and afternoon chores. They provide wonderful comfort and support and create the illusion that I am actually walking on a could surrounded by unicorns.
Adidas,5,"I workout in these every day! i like a lighter shoe, and these are awesome! i am normally a size 9 so that’s what i ordered, and i feel like i could have gotten an 8.5. Still fits awesome though!!"
Adidas,5,I would go 1/2-1 size smaller than usual.
Adidas,5,"I would not use these shoes for working out as I don't think they offer enough support. However, they are super comfortable and light weight! I've purchased in multiple colors for walking and work."
Adidas,5,I would recommend sizing up on this shoe I wear a 5½ but got a 6 and the 6 is a little tighter around my foot then what I'm use to but fits great.
Adidas,5,"I would size down by half a size next time. Otherwise, these are high quality and lightweight."
Adidas,5,"I would still order your normal shoe size. I ordered a 9 and 8.5, just because my experience with adidas sizing has fluctuated lately. I’m a big adidas shoe wearer and I’m usually a 9, but some of the newer models are too big for me. Well, I kept the 8.5, and it’s pretty cozy, but feels tight after a workout. Stick with your real size and learn from my mistake. I really do love these shoes, except I’ve seen them on like 9 girls walking around town now. Time for a new It shoe!"
Adidas,5,I’m 5’2” and I 135lbs I walk heavy and loudly . My feet never hurt wearing these in my daily medical assisting job where I’m constantly on my feet . The cloud foam is AMAZING and the money is definitely worth it . I’m not surprised the price is higher for how amazing these feel on my feet ! I will be only being cloud foam ADIDAS for work & any other feet wear cloud foam comes in .
Adidas,5,"I’m 9.5 other adidas shoes. Personally I should have half sized down, the toe area is elongated and narrows. Not good for hikes/dirt area you will slide. Also, not for moderate exercise but it grips a yoga mat, but these are my outdoor shoes so no.  Overall really cute when they were clean and the grey blends the dirt. They’re fully worn in now, and I haven’t worn them too consistently either. Anyways, they were okay. Avoid if you have a toe injury, there are more supportive shoes."
Adidas,5,I’m a Nurse and these are the BEST shoes I’ve ever used!! They are extremely comfortable during my shifts. I’m so happy with my purchase!!!!
Adidas,5,I’m a nurse and wear these shoes for work and I love them
Adidas,5,"I’m a resident taking 28 hour calls and these shoes are up to the task. They’re soft yet supportive. They slide on and off easily, but don’t slip off your feet while your walking. And honestly they look so much more polished than the classic clogs. I will definitely buy them again when I’ve worn mine out."
Adidas,5,"I’m a size 7.5/8 and I got a 7.5, they fit perfect! extremely comfortable  I will be purchasing these in another color!"
Adidas,5,I’m always a little skeptical buying sneakers online but these fit great! True to size and extremely comfortable. I wear these mostly for running and cardio not good for heavy lifting.
Adidas,5,"I’m always really nervous buying new shoes. I have scar tissue on my heels that loves to rub against any new pair of shoes I purchase - usually resulting in bloody painful blisters. These sneakers have a higher back than most which is what my main source for concern was. However, the high back is perfect. The shoes are extremely lightweight, snug in the right places, and do NOT rub blisters. I will absolutely purchase these again."
Adidas,5,I’m an ER nurse. I just work 14.5 hours straight while wearing these shoes. I felt like little angels were carrying me around all day and night. I was walking on literal clouds. My dogs certainly aren’t barking. I’m one happy customer.
Adidas,5,I’m glad I got these
Adidas,5,"I’m gonna be honest I never write reviews, but these shoes have worked incredibly well. They’re not only great for your every day walking needs, but they worked for me on a 6 mile hike in Arizona where I didn’t slip once! The shoes are very comfortable and fit perfect! I loved them so much I’ve recommended them to everyone I know!"
Adidas,5,I’m in love with these shoes! I can never find a good pair of walking shoes with support and comfort that last. These ones do!
Adidas,5,"I’m in the Army National Guard and we take our physical training test on a track. The running shoes I had before these are not good track shoes. I bought these the shoes make a difference in your performance. I love these shoes, they are great on the track and on the road. Very comfortable and light; is like running on clouds. These are my new running shoes when I don’t run on trails. Absolutely awesome, I referred them to my friend. I only refer things that work amazing and I think others can benefit from. Hope your as happy with your pair as I am."
Adidas,5,I’m normally a 7.5-8 and the 7 fits perfectly. I love them so much i have them in two colors already and plan on getting more
Adidas,5,"I’m not a runner, but I love HIIT workouts and these have been amazing. They’re so light, and they look amazing on."
Adidas,5,I’m not sure if there was a glitch or special going on but these were a great price !
Adidas,5,I’m obsessed with these shoes!
Adidas,5,"I’m obsessed with these shoes! I bought them specifically for running, and they’re great. I’ve noticed my left knee doesn’t hurt after running in these."
Adidas,5,I’m obsessed with these shoes. I already owned a pair of pink Cloudfoam shoes but I wanted a more neutral pair. These are PERFECT! Most comfortable shoe ever! All day wear keeps my feet feeling awesome (and I’m a teacher so I’m on my feet all day)!!!
Adidas,5,I’m on my feet all day and these are probably the most comfortable sneakers I have bought yet!
Adidas,5,"I’m on my feet all day and they’re so comfortable, I would recommend them to everyone that I could."
Adidas,5,"I’m on my feet all day at a children’s dental office. I have every color option in these shoes (that were available on Amazon) and love them. Even wearing them the first day I got them in, no sore feet. You don’t need to “break them in”, they come comfortable. Great support, fits as expected (I wear a 7.5, the same as I wear in any Nike shoe) and are great for the gym too. I recently switched from Nike brand to Adidas and haven’t been disappointed."
Adidas,5,"I’m on my feet all day at work on concrete floors and these are the only shoes I’ve found that don’t have my feet just screaming in pain every night I come home. Lightweight and cushy, I can’t find anything negative to remark on."
Adidas,5,"I’m on my feet most of the day and these shoes are supportive and comfortable, plus they’re cute too."
Adidas,5,I’m originally a size 10 or 9.5 so I ordered these in a 9.5 but they were too big but I returned and ordered them in a size 9. Size 9 is perfect!! They are super cute and comfortable. Love them thinking of getting them in another color.
Adidas,5,"I’m so happy I found these! I bought a pair of these in store over a year ago that were a little darker blue and have been looking for another pair but they only ever have them in black or white. I absolutely love these shoes, they are so lightweight and comfortable!"
Adidas,5,I’m so in love with these shoes. It’s literally like walking on a cloud. And they are so cute
Adidas,5,"I’m usually a 7 1/2 in other shoes. I got a 7 in this shoe and it fits perfectly. I love these shoes. I’m very active. I wear them when walking around town but I also wear them working out. I haven’t run in them, but I do lots of weight training. They probably aren’t the best for squats and things because of the cloud foam, but they’re so comfy that I just find myself putting them on everyday. I got the white ones. I can see how they might get a little dirty. If anyone has any info on how to wash these I’d love to hear it."
Adidas,5,I’m usually a 8.5 I got an 8!
Adidas,5,"I’m usually a size 7 and ordered a size 7 and it’s perfect. Favorite, most comfortable tennis shoes. I have them in three colors"
Adidas,5,"I’m usually an 8.5 but the 9 fit perfectly. I heard about these shoes from the CNN list of best gifts from amazon. These shoes are truly amazing! They are light weight, so comfy! I can walk all day in them with no problems, fit perfectly and comfortably since day 1. I have since bought 3 more in different colors. They are great for travel too because they are slip on!"
Adidas,5,I’m very happy with these shoes. I bought the maroon and black pairs and the colors looked as expected. I wear a size 10 in sneakers and these fit perfectly. They are easier to get on than other no lace sneakers I’ve purchased in the past. The heel back is flexible and easy to move around as youre sliding your foot in. They fit snug and are soft. Very happy with my purchase.
Adidas,5,"I’m very picky when it comes to buying tennis shoes. My feet are on the wider side and I normally wear a size 8-8.5 depending on the brand. I bought a size 8 and they fit perfectly. They’re so light weight, very easy to walk in and wide enough for my feet. The price is also good too and it comes in so many different colors. I’ll definitely purchase some of the other colors since they’re so comfy!"
Adidas,5,"I’ve always liked Adidas. So I took a chance on a different style. Boy was I surprised!! The fit, the comfort everything about this style has been great. It’s lightweight so you don’t feel weighed down. The material is very breathable. Had net had any problems with washing any dirt or dust of them, all comes right out.
Overall definitely a style I would recommend.
I’ve since bought a second pair because the first pair were so amazing. So now I alternate"
Adidas,5,I’ve always sued sketchers for running shoes but I have to say these are hands down awesome and comfy for running for everyday
Adidas,5,"I’ve been walking a lot, volunteering, and I have actually forgotten about certain discomfort I used to feel. I feel like I have good support and that’s what was important for me."
Adidas,5,I’ve been wearing these every day during my pregnancy. The cushion support is fantastic. Plus the slip on is easy for me since I can’t bend over my belly. I found them at a fantastic price and will definitely snatch up a back up pair if the price drops back down to $30.
Adidas,5,"I’ve found that adidas run large so I bought an 8. I’m usually a 8.5-9. Very light, comfy, and stretchy."
Adidas,5,"I’ve had a burgundy pair of these for almost 2 years, and I love them.  They are still in good shape, but I wanted a lighter color.  As other reviews state, unless you have a wider foot, you can go half size down in these.  I typically wear a 9.5 in dress shoes and a 10 in boots or sneakers.  I take the 9.5 in these.  Also, these are not really running shoes.  They’re cute and comfy to slip on with or without no show socks to do your errands and other day to day tasks.  They are just not supportive for heavy exercise or running.  Cute look though with jeans or leggings."
Adidas,5,I’ve had these shoes for over a year now and wear them to work daily. They have held up nicely and are very comfortable!
Adidas,5,I’ve had these sneakers in the past and just LOVED them.  Most stores in my area no longer carry them since they are clearanced now. I just hope Adidas doesn’t quit making them.
Adidas,5,I’ve had this style for a few years and wear them so much I got my mom a pair too. She loves them too!
Adidas,5,I’ve never had shoes that fit this amazing! I’m actually about to buy another pair!
Adidas,5,"I’ve wanted maroon shoes for a while so I really got these for the look and brand.
They are much more comfortable than I expected. I paid them with compression socks and wear them when I’m expected to do a lot of walking, ie grocery shopping or walking several miles at Costco. Soooo comfy and my feet never hurt when I finally make it home.
I’d buy again, in a different color of course. Though the ones I like aren’t available in my size- I have big feet lol. I’ll keep checking back though."
Adidas,5,I'd give these more stars if I could. I have two pair in different colors. Super comfortable. Fit perfectly.
Adidas,5,ideal for me!  to run
Adidas,5,"If I could change anything, I would eliminate the heel tab, which my Jean's get hung up on. 5 ⭐ overall."
Adidas,5,"If they can survive a trip to Disneyland and an everyday shift at an ER then I’m sure they can survive an apocalypse...maybe.

So far so great with these shoes. SO soft and comfy. Even when I’m not walking or putting any pressure on them..they are comfy. Wore them running around Disneyland and wear them running around work and my feet don’t hurt as bad as they used to. They fit true to size, and now I could only hope they’ll last as long as my precious pair of sneakers (seven years) happy as a cloud"
Adidas,5,"If you are looking for a good walking shoe, this is definitely the number one pick, with great support and not too bulky or heavy. They really are like clouds. I will say that they run narrow, or rather, my feet run wide, so I would recommend going 1/2 size up if your feet run wide."
Adidas,5,"If you are looking for a nice everyday walking shoe, this is for you! I love the cloud foam that is embedded in the shoe. Literally feels like walking on a cloud. I love the chic white look with the gold strips. It fits my minimalist aesthetic. Would purchase another pair!"
Adidas,5,"If you have narrow/slim feet, this sneaker will fit kind of wide, but it is very comfortable."
Adidas,5,"If you like your shoe snug, go a half size down. But otherwise perfect shoe."
Adidas,5,"If you were debating on buying these shoes, do it! They are ridiculously comfortable they fit perfectly very true to size."
Adidas,5,If you work on your feet for 10 plus hours a day... these are for you.  My feet don't hurt and they are  stylish
Adidas,5,"I'm a middle school teacher and always on my feet. I was looking for a comfortable, supportive pair of sneakers that would fit in my budget. These shoes definitely fit those criteria! I highly recommend them."
Adidas,5,"I'm a nurse & work for 12 hours on my feet.  I also have very flat, very wide, large feet for a woman (thank you Nana!) lol  These shoes are so comfy!  They're super light, flexible, they don't make any noise when I'm sneaking into my patients room in the middle of the night to do things, they don't make my feet sweat or stink.  I'm considering getting another pair to be running around, every day shoes b/c wearing your gross nursing shoes outside the hospital...yuck!  My ONLY complaint about the shoes are that the soles can be a bit thin.  I notice when I take my dogs on walks & they decide to pull me off the beaten path & I have to walk over rocks or tree branches, you feel it!  So for hiking or any surfaces that aren't ""normal walking"" areas, they're not the best for that.  Otherwise, absolutely amazing shoes!"
Adidas,5,I'm a nurse and I spend the majority of my 12 hour shift on my feet. These shoes have made a huge impact on my level of comfort throughout the day. It's like walking on a cloud. I'm probably going to buy a second pair in another color.
Adidas,5,"I'm a nurse and I work 12 hour shifts (lets be real, usually 12-14 hours) so I was in search of a shoe that was really comfortable, offered support, and wasn't a clog! I LOVE these shoes. I wear a size 7 normally, which is what I ordered, and they fit perfectly. I have a high arch to my foot and the soft cushion on the bottom hugs my arch really well and is so comfortable. Not to mention, they're not a bad price at all. I'll definitely be ordering these again when its time for new shoes."
Adidas,5,I'm a size 7 and this fit perfectly and are light weight and good for walking.
Adidas,5,I'm a true 9 narrow and I bought the 8.5 because of all the reviews and they fit perfectly. Super cute! Almost like a slide on shoe but great for running and every day wear.
Adidas,5,I'm a true size 8 and it fit perfectly. Bought for a trip coming up to Europe so I had comfortable walking shoes. I actually just sprained my ankle so I've been wearing these and they are very comfortable. Also really cute! I bought grey and have gotten multiple compliments. Would definitely recommend.
Adidas,5,I'm an 8.5 and it was true to size. Great light weight shoe exactly as pictured. And fast delivery! Just wish it had a little more padding near the toes.
Adidas,5,"I'm an RN and I work 12 hour shifts. I am on my feet constantly, and I wear these (or another of the 3 colors that I have) everyday. 10/10 would recommend."
Adidas,5,I'm in love with these running shoes. They are super lightweight and so comfortable. I've been using them for a couple months now and they're still good as new.
Adidas,5,"I'm new to running and wanted a basic shoe to start out in after having problems with other shoes. I went out for a run right after getting them and I thought they were great (no blisters, feet didn't hurt after, etc.). I was slightly hesitant to get these after reading old reviews of people saying they got fake/used pairs but mine came in an Adidas box (not beaten up), clearly had never been worn outside before (still had tags on), and overall seem great quality.

If you're on the cusp of being between two sizes (for me I'm between 8.5 and 9 women's) I would recommend sizing up."
Adidas,5,"I'm NOT an athlete, but I do get in 12 miles a week on my treadmill. I replaced my New Balance with these and they're AWESOME. Lightweight and comfortable for a jog on the treadmill. Great support. Would buy again"
Adidas,5,In love with these shoes!! Can’t believe I snagged them for $35!
Adidas,5,"In love with this shoes , go with your original shoe size mines is usually a 7 and i ordered a size 7 and it fits perfect so comfortable , i think i’m going to order more colors :)"
Adidas,5,Incredibly comfortable running shoe. Looks great as well.
Adidas,5,Incredibly comfortable! Ordering another in a different color too because I like this one so much.
Adidas,5,"Initially I thought I wouldn't like them. The seams felt odd. But then I wore them around the house, and couldn't stop. They are so comfortable."
Adidas,5,Is nice and comfortable
Adidas,5,"It fit great! I was unsure because of ordering online of course, but I got a 9.5 and they fit very comfortably. They are super light weight, so when I pick them up they’re as light as a feather. Super breathable!"
Adidas,5,It fit so well. I love them. And they are super cute!
Adidas,5,"It fits perfectly and i bought these shoes to dance in. it was exactly what i wanted and expected, easy to point in and jump around in for drill team practice! comfortable to wear around all day as well."
Adidas,5,It is literally like walking on a cloud or pillow. It has little lumps for cushioning in the sole. Really light weight shoe and spacious. I love the white with black heathering!!!
Adidas,5,It is very comfortable
Adidas,5,It looked big but the fit was just perfect. Purchased to use for my clinical rounds in the hospital.
Adidas,5,"It looks just as it picture, very comfortable, very happy with this purchasw."
Adidas,5,It was a bit bigger thank expected.
Adidas,5,It was a gift for my sister and she loved them!!
Adidas,5,"It was a gift for my sister she loved it, it fit perfect"
Adidas,5,It was comfortable to wear and memory foam inside the sneaker was great. I had it on for several hours and it helped me move around smoothly.
Adidas,5,It’s like putting on a sock ...snug in the upper part of foot and Roomy in the lower part. It’s a nice looking shoe. I’m diggin them. I don’t have to hassle with laces. Just put on and go!
Adidas,5,It’s ridiculous how comfortable these are. I wish I could never wear another shoe again. Seriously they are that awesome! Super cute too. I get compliments all the time. So incredibly light weight.
Adidas,5,It’s so comfortable that I ordered a second pair!
Adidas,5,"It’s very comfortable and gives support, I’m on my second pair. The first pair lasted for 5+ months of daily use and long walks."
Adidas,5,Item arrived as described and earlier then expected! Would buy from seller again!
Adidas,5,"It's a bit large and wider than I used to. I have returned 7.5 size and just ordered 7, should fit me perfectly!!!"
Adidas,5,"Its a good shoe for the price.. I have been wearing it everyday for 2 months and it looks great..
Hopefully it will last longer"
Adidas,5,"It's an amazing product, comfortable, very light in weight. Just perfect for common exercises at the gym. If you're looking for higher impact shoes, these ones probably won't work."
Adidas,5,"it's comfortable and good for a small/light workout. I wouldn't recommend it for heavy HIIT workouts though, more like a light-stay-at-home workout :)"
Adidas,5,It's comfortable and work perfectly.
Adidas,5,it's comfortable to wear.
Adidas,5,Its just verry cool
Adidas,5,"I've always wore Nike, but lately nothing I've tried is comfortable..so I was kinda nervous to try adidas thinking it would be the same.  I am now all about the adidas shoe!"
Adidas,5,"I've been doing a lot of walking lately and wanted a comfortable shoe that would provide support but not make me feel like I'm clomping around.  I've always liked Adidas products, so decided to give these a try.

From the moment I pulled them out of the box and put them on, it was perfect. They were light weight but not flimsy. They were comfortable and fit just right. (I'm a size 7, ordered a size 7, and they fit just right.) But, for me, the best thing was that they didn't require any breaking in.  Typically my pointy heel rubs against the back of a new shoe for weeks before it breaks in and becomes comfortable.  But with these, I haven't had a problem.  And I've probably put 20+ miles on them within the first week.  I've honestly been thinking about getting another pair so I've got them ready when I need them.

So yes, I definitely recommend them."
Adidas,5,"I've been trying to find a shoe that fits my size 12 women feet.  I tried two other brands and their size 12 women's shoes just were too small.  I finally ordered these and was so happy that they actually fit well!  The shoes are comfortable and I love how they look.  (However, the box they came in was damaged.  Not sure if that occurred during shipping or prior to being shipped.  Thankfully the shoes weren't damaged)"
Adidas,5,"I've bought this shoe in almost every color! They are very comfortable and versatile. I've used them to go to the gym, for a run, to the airport, and basically everywhere. I can also wear them without socks, without damaging my foot. They are also reasonably priced!"
Adidas,5,"I've enjoyed these shoes so much, I actually own 5 pairs.  The mesh-like fabric allows for comfort when my feet swell after being on them all day.  Some inside shoe fabrics cause my feet to get hot, almost like burning, but this particular shoe is comfortable all day long.  The size is true to fit.  I wear a 10.  I bought a 10.  A 10 fits perfectly.  Highly recommend."
Adidas,5,"I've had multiple foot surgeries so it's always a struggle finding footwear that is supportive and attractive, but these are IT!!!  I will definitely be ordering other colors tonight!  I have custom orthotics so I ordered my shoes 1/2 size larger, otherwise they are sized appropriately.  Honestly, I could not be happier and I'm a forever Adidas customer!"
Adidas,5,"I've had these in my cart for months but wasn't sure due to conflicting reviews on width. I have wide feet and most shoes squeeze my toes, these don't and they're comfy. And super cute. Perfect for working out or just with a casual outfit. I haven't used them for running yet so can't comment much on that though."
Adidas,5,"I've loved these shoes. I'm a walker not a runner so can't speak to that aspect of the shoe, but they've served my active lifestyle well. They're breathable and lightweight, stylish for all casual occasions and are the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned, by far."
Adidas,5,"I've never worn Adidas before. I tried this pair on at Famous Footwear and thought they were so comfortable, like wearing slippers. Only Famous Footwear sold them for $65 on clearance! Of course, I went to Amazon to see if I could find them cheaper. I did and I am so happy that I bought them. I wear them all the time. My feet are comfy and warm. I would definitely recommend buying them. I'm ready for another pair in another color."
Adidas,5,I've ordered two pairs of these sneakers. These are the best sneakers that I've ever owned. They are lightweight and incredibly comfortable. They are the mot comfortable pair of sneakers I've ever had. They are cute and stylish. I think I will be purchasing a pair for my mom. They do run a little bigger than normal. I took the advice of others and ordered a half size smaller. I wear a 5.5 in sneakers and I had to order a 5 and that fit just fine.
Adidas,5,"I've spent hours standing in these and they're a dream. The fit is good, the style is cute, and I'm in love with the memory foam. I want more!"
Adidas,5,"I've walked a many miles in this shoe, outstanding they are."
Adidas,5,Just as described!
Adidas,5,"Just as pictured, love!"
Adidas,5,Just got the shoes tried them on… They run a little big but I think I’ll keep them. I am what I consider to be a true eight and these are slightly bag. The shoes and selves are very comfortable and look amazing! Quick delivery
Adidas,5,"Just got these and I love the look and feel. Super lightweight. I don’t think I’ll be wearing these much for workouts because the support isn’t what I want for that, but great for a day to day comfortable sneaker. I’m usually hesitant to buy sneakers where the tongue isn’t separate from the rest of the shoe, but I really love the fit of these."
Adidas,5,"Just like clouds on my feet, so comfortable and lots of support."
Adidas,5,Just the perfect shoe!
Adidas,5,Just tried these on and they are very comfortable. The most comfortable pair of shoes I’ve ever owned. I’m very happy with my choice!
Adidas,5,"Keep in mind that these shoes are slip-ons, so they are a little loose around the ankles.  But they are super comfortable and look really cute.  Probably not the best option for working out, but GREAT for walking around or a casual outfit.  I'm very happy with them!"
Adidas,5,"La tela del tenis es de mala calidad, no tiene elasticidad,"
Adidas,5,Las utiliza mi esposa para caminar
Adidas,5,Less arch support than i thought it would have
Adidas,5,"Let me preface this by saying I would never ever wear these to the gym. They are not for running or lifting. But I wanted a comfortable, knit fabric slip-on shoe for my 12-hr ER shifts and this is exactly that. They have held up remarkably well for the amount of walking I do at work. They are so comfortable that I bought a second pair to be my “clean” shoes to wear around town outside of the hospital. I did find that my normal size was too large. I think it’s because of the comfy stretchy materiel. I sized down 1/2 size and they were perfect."
Adidas,5,Let me say....I loved the shoe and gave it 5 stars. It unfortunately ran big. I mean a good bit bigger; and I gave them to a friend that wears a size 9 normally. I purchased an 8. So just know that when purchasing.  I could have easily worn a 7. But do love the shoe.
Adidas,5,"Let’s be clear from the onset: these are not running shoes. If you’re running across the street to your car, or running for the ice cream truck, then ok. These are ultra thin, cheaply made clouds for your feet. Excellent to tool around in. It’s barefoot-without-wanting-to-end-a-life-from-stepping-on-Legos support, which means none. Zero. Don’t pay more than $40-$50 for these, because you’ll be replacing them in six months. DO buy a pair in every color when you find them on sale because there isn’t a stinker in the bunch. They’re that cute. You can adjust the shoe with the laces even though these are slip-ons. I’d recommend if under $45."
Adidas,5,Let’s just say I feel like I’m walking on clouds! I have these in almost every color. I’m a nurse and these are a god sent! Easy to out on as well which is a plus!!!
Adidas,5,Light & so comfortable. True to size!!
Adidas,5,"light airy comfortable shoe for casual walking
could not wear on treadmill, made feet hurt"
Adidas,5,"Light and clean lookin, doesn't feel like I have to break them in as much."
Adidas,5,Light and comfortable
Adidas,5,Light and flexible ... great all around shoe!  Would not recommend for longer running.
Adidas,5,"Light and very comfortable shoe. I'm a 9.5 this fit a little loose and big, I ordered a 8 and that was too tight. So order your size just expect it to be a little loose but still very comfortable and light"
Adidas,5,"light as air, trendy color."
Adidas,5,Light comfortable soft
Adidas,5,Light comfy stylish :)
Adidas,5,light on feet yet great on support! Very comfortable. My walking pace is way better with my new Adidas. Feel more confident!
Adidas,5,LIGHT SHOE
Adidas,5,Light weight
Adidas,5,"Light weight and comfortable. Haven’t used for running, I don’t think it would be enough support"
Adidas,5,Light weight and perfect for running.

Adidas,5,Like
Adidas,5,Like
Adidas,5,"Like a walk on the clouds! Literally! I don’t know for running, but for walking they are sooooo soft! Perfect!"
Adidas,5,"Like all Adidas, make sure to order half size smaller. These are very light and comfy. Used them on long walking trips around Ireland and on the tennis court. Easy slip on and off as there's no actual tongue, just laces to get them tight on your feet."
Adidas,5,"Like everything, one of my comfortable pares."
Adidas,5,Like it !!!
Adidas,5,Like it works great
Adidas,5,"Like that these shoes are lightweight, the sole is cushioned, the upper cloth covering is soft and flexible. They are very comfortable!"

Adidas,5,Like walking on air. Very comfy and true to size.
Adidas,5,Like walking on clouds
Adidas,5,Like walking on clouds!!! Love them!!
Adidas,5,"LIKE: I like the various shades of gray being used. The peach is a great contrast and just enough so you notice it, but in no way distracting. I also like the cloudfoam memory foam.

Dislike: my sneaker size varies with the manufacturer. These are my first Adidas. I am a size 5 in general for any shoe. My existing sneakers are Nike and 1 pair is a 6 and the other is a 4. It’s not a design flaw that they are a bit big bc as I said, I vary. They will be fine with a little tissue in the toe area.

Bought to have a sneaker for darker clothes like joggers. They are beautiful!"
Adidas,5,Liked the style and color
Adidas,5,"Listen. This shoe isn't going to run your marathon for you, complete a triathalon or do your dishes. But it will make you look amazing when you put them on after to go get a coffee! These are my go to shoe when I am in workout mode, but no plans to work out. I love these shoes with their soft sole and super fly look. I just slip these puppies on!! Babygirl, just put them in your cart already. I am whispering softly in your ear, if you buy them they will come. They will come anyway, and frankly probably too fast. But I digress. Buy these shoes. Do it.  They go on sale every so often, so if you buy them regular now, you can just buy them over again when they go on special because you will already be fantasizing about them again. ( and your previous pair will probably look like garbage by then if you are doing it right. ) Did I mention to buy these shoes? Oh yeah! Listen to jjinreallife I know what I am talking about."
Adidas,5,Lite weight and looks nice with my outfit
Adidas,5,Literally feels like your walking on clouds!

Adidas,5,Looks great. Well made. Super comfy. What more could you want in a shoe? I would definitely recommend this shoe.
Adidas,5,"Looks just as pictured, and they’re extremely comfortable. The only thing is that I’m usually a true 6.5 but when I tried them on they fit pretty big. Had to exchange for a 6 which fit perfect. I will say I have a skinny foot, which may be why it was so big? But I don’t usually have this problem, especially with tennis shoes."

Son iguales que en la imagen.
En general me gusta mucho el modelo y son muy cómodos.
En mi opinión, estos zapatos son para personas con pies delgados ya que la parte de adelante del zapato podría lastimar un poco si tienes el pie ancho."

Adidas,5,"Love Adidas Cloudfoams! Before this style of shoe, I had an ankle that'll act up every now and then. Now, I only have pain when I wear non supporting shoes and standing around all day.

I use these to lift and do cardio but would not recommend for a heavy leg day, I don’t think they would give enough support or grip for that.

I don't use them for working out, running, etc. I keep them on for every day errands, walking and casual wear when I don't want to wear a flip flop. Very comfortable and true to size. I wear an 11 it fits perfectly. No need for socks, they are very breathable, or no show socks work great with them too. The shoelaces are more for show, you cant really tighten them, the shoe has more of a slip on vibe."

Adidas,5,"Love these shoes! Super cute & fit perfectly. I normally wear. 6.5 & probably could have been fine in a half size down, as well, but the 6.5 are comfortable & not falling off my feet.

Adidas,5,Love these shoes! They are so comfortable for everyday wear or gym shoes!
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! They are so light and comfortable! I walked about 3 miles in them in the Turks and Caicos and they were seriously so comfortable! As a person who always wears sandals I love throwing these on especially when traveling!
Adidas,5,"Love these shoes! They are super comfortable and match with everything. I normally wear a 9.5 and got these in a 9, they run a tad big. My foot is very narrow but the shoe would fit a regular width foot."
Adidas,5,"Love these shoes! They are super cute and easy to take on and off. They have been really comfortable to wear to the gym and as a casual shoe. I’ve worn them while weightlifting and during cardio and they have been great! My feet did feel a little tired after running 3-4 miles, so they may not be the best for long distance running."
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! They are the only tennis shoes I have ever had that I didn’t have to “break in” for them to be comfortable!
Adidas,5,"LOVE these shoes! They are very lightweight and fit like a glove. They are easy to slip on and off but still nice and snug. The no-tongue is nice. I wouldn't recommend wearing these for running, training or anything high impact as they are a pretty basic shoe with no support, but I bought these to just be a regular sneaker to wear on a daily basis, airline travel etc so they met my intended use. Think of them like the Nike Free."
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! They look great on me and fit perfect 🥰 so happy definitely recommend
Adidas,5,"Love these shoes! They look sleek, are great for errands or a run. The grey doesn't get dirty easily and the white soles stay white with a little wipe now and then. And they are incredibly LIGHT but don't sacrifice comfort at all. Some shoes pinch my ankles or top of my feet (I think I have a real canckle situation) and these don't at all. They didn't take much breaking in at all and they fit like a glove, er, shoe. I used to be a die-hard Nike wearer but I may be converted now."
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! They're very comfortable and look very nice.
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! This is our 3rd purchase of this brand! Most comfortable shoes ever!
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! True to size. Only downfall is the get dirty very fast- but clean easily as well. I’ll purchase other colors!
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! Very light and comfortable! True to size. Will for sure order more in different colors.
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! Wear these probably once or twice a week super cute easy to clean and fit nice. Also very good for the price it’s way more expensive in the store. But I would not recommend these to go the gym I wear these just to school and walking and their soft and comfortable but I would not recommend working out in them.
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! Would by again!
Adidas,5,Love these shoes! Would consider ordering more in different colors. Super lightweight and did not require a breaking in period. Fit great and were immediately comfortable.
Adidas,5,Love these shoes!!
Adidas,5,Love these shoes!!  Comfortable. Light weight and flexible.
Adidas,5,love these shoes!! so comfy and great quality
Adidas,5,Love these shoes!! Super comfortable- and great support!
Adidas,5,"Love these shoes!!! I first discovered these at a local shoe store.  I'm normally a size 8 or 8.5 depending on the brand of shoe and the 8's fit me perfectly with thin (or no) socks.  If you wear slightly thicker socks, you may want to go up a half size. I promptly wore these for 3 days straight at Disneyland after only wearing them for about a week prior and had zero blisters!! They were so comfortable! When I got back, I returned to the store to buy the other 2 colors but was disappointed to find out that they did not have my size in stock. Amazon comes through once again! Found the other colors in my size with free Prime shipping. One other thing to note, these are more of a slip on shoe. There are laces but you don't need to undo them to get the shoe on or off.  There is no tongue like a normal shoe so the laces seem more like a decoration. They can tighten the shoe somewhat though if you feel that are too lose."

Adidas,5,Love these shoes!!! I paid way too much for them here though!!!! Found them $30 cheaper in a store! Besides that I absolutely love them! They are very comfortable!
Adidas,5,Love these shoes!!! They are like walking on air. I would not want to use them for working out though.

Adidas,5,"Love these shoes, they’re my second pair in a different color. One of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn. I work 12 hr days on my feet and these shoes are lightweight and comfy! I’m normally a 9.5-10 shoe size and for these I order 9.5 and they fit perfectly."
Adidas,5,"Love these shoes, this is my second pair of the exact same shoe. So comfortable but also stylish. My feet never hurt when wearing these even when walking for long distances. I don’t use them for exercise or hiking but for casual walks and Disneyland. I have very low arches and some knee/hip issues."
Adidas,5,Love these shoes.  Feels like I’m walking on air!
Adidas,5,Love these shoes.  They are comfortable and cute.  I am a dog sitter and am on my feet all day running and walking my charges.  These shoes are perfect for my life style.

Adidas,5,Love these shoes. Great memory foam. Super comfortable. Great fit.

Adidas,5,"Love these shoes. I'm glad I went with my gut instinct and not the reviews on the fit and size.  I wear a 9.5 and that is what I ordered and they fit perfect. Also the width fit perfect.  I wear a medium width.
  Love the room in the toe area and how lightweight they are. These are just for casual and errand runs. I can't attest to the durability as I only wore them twice. Will update with that information next month."
Adidas,5,Love these shoes. Lots of compliments and very comfortable!

Adidas,5,Love these shoes. They do run large. I sized down half a size and probably could have done a full size.
Adidas,5,Love these shoes. They’re my second pair! Thinking about buying them in other colors. They’re so comfortable and great for running.
Adidas,5,Love these shoes. This is my 3rd pair. They are so comfortable. I normally wear a size 9 in shoes but I get these in an 8.5 and they fit perfect.
Adidas,5,Love these shoes. This is my second pair but first time buying it on amazon. Very comfortable. My last pair lasted me for a year and a half. Keep in mind I used them daily for the gym and errands. So for as much as I used them they lasted. I still have them the only the is the bottom sole is smooth. That is why I had to repurchase the same ones again.
Adidas,5,"Love these shoes. This is the second pair I bought. Most athletic shoes make my toes hurt, or are heavy. These are not like that.  I don’t run in them, they are for everyday wear so I can’t say how they are in a work out. But, they’re light, cool, and comfy. I would buy again."
Adidas,5,Love these shoes. Very cute and comfortable but I wouldn't use them for workouts. Just casual walking/etc. They are a little large (I ordered my normal size) and I could've rounded down a half size but I won't return.
Adidas,5,"Love these shoes. Very cute with everything.

Not so comfortable after I stood for a long time but they are great for a sleek, not bulky, tennis shoe."

Adidas,5,Love these shoes... So comfy and easy to slip on and off. I have them in a blue and now the black. Absolutely the most comfortable shoe to walk in and they (blue ones) have lasted for me for 2 years and have more than enough life left. That's why I got the black ones.
Adidas,5,"Love these shoes.... They're my second pair!
I don't use them to workout or run bc I prefer a bit more support when exercising, but these are my go-to casual shoe. Love them"
Adidas,5,Love these shoes...my second pair.
Adidas,5,"Love these shoes...this is my second pair, and I will buy more in the future."
Adidas,5,Love these shoes..very comfortable..will buy again
Adidas,5,Love these shows!!! Need them in white!
Adidas,5,Love these sneakers for a casual look & also to work out.
Adidas,5,Love these sneakers they are very cute and very comfortable but they do run smaller in my opinion I got my normal size 7.5 and they are a bit tighter than what I wanted but still fit! But they are cloth and white so def have to be super careful not to get anything on the material !
Adidas,5,Love these sneakers!  So cute and comfortable!!!!
Adidas,5,Love these sneakers!  Very light weight and extremely comfortable. They slip on without undoing laces.
Adidas,5,Love these sneakers! Fit is perfect. They look like a tied shoe but are slip ons! Throw them in the washer and they come out looking and feeling like new again!
Adidas,5,"Love these sneakers! They are so easy to throw on and look cute. They are extremely comfy with memory foam like insole. I have the black and just received the grey pictured. I absolutely love the grey! They look really cute with leggings, jeans or shorts. They don’t give blisters or anything. I am always a size 8 in sneakers and I purchased these in 7.5. My last pair was in 8 but these size 7.5 fits better. Yes I would say they run slightly big compared to other sneakers like Nike or new balance. I have many other pairs of sneakers but these are always the ones I grab for on a daily basis! These are great for leg/knee/back problems!"
Adidas,5,"Love these sneakers, bought 2 pair."
Adidas,5,"love these sneakers. they run a little big, I sized down half a size."
Adidas,5,Love these sneakers. Very comfortable. I like them so much this is my 2nd pair

Adidas,5,"Love these! I have two pairs. Very comfortable, great color."
Adidas,5,Love these! I normally have bought new Nike Free’s every year and a half and these feel just like them but I think are much cuter. I normally wear a 7.5 in Nike so I got both the 7 and 7.5 in these since ppl said to size down. I stuck with the 7.5 because the 7 left no room while wearing super thin socks. Would def recommend.
Adidas,5,"Love these! I wanted a cute casual shoe, not for working out but for wearing daily and this is perfect! I get so many compliments when I wear them. Planning on wearing them to Disney and I think they’ll hold up fine with the amount I’ve been wearing them."
Adidas,5,"Love these! I work in retail and am constantly running around, these are one of the only shoes that don’t hurt my feet after hour 6. They do run a little on the big size so go down a half a size"

Adidas,5,Love these! These shoes are so comfortable.
Adidas,5,"Love these! They are great for traveling and any event where you're planning to walk a lot. They are light weight and slip on and off without having to untie/re-tie the laces. I have a flat foot, so I need more support for a running shoe than that's provide, but for theme parks, traveling, and running errands, these are my go-to shoes"
Adidas,5,Love these! They are so lightweight and comfortable. Even cuter in person too.
Adidas,5,LOVE these! They are super comfortable! I ordered a half size up in case they ran small. I could've bought my usual size but these fit great too. They have good support and I would definitely recommend and would buy again!
Adidas,5,"Love these! They run a little big, I went down a half-size but they are super comfy!"
Adidas,5,"Love these! They wouldn’t be comfortable for working out in my opinion, but great for just running around town. Fit true to size."

Adidas,5,"Love these!!! Was looking for a cute ""walking around"" tennis shoe and these fit the bill. They fit TTS and are so dang comfy. The only thing now is.. I need new white socks"
Adidas,5,"Love these, casual and sleek, the monochromatic look makes these less casual than more frumpy sneakers and I wear these everywhere."
Adidas,5,"Love these, so comfy and stylish! I get lots of compliments on them."
Adidas,5,"Love these, they don’t feel like a weight on my feet considering I’m a size 11. Nice and lightweight, foam sole is springy and comfy. Charcoal color makes it not look so much like a tennis shoe."
Adidas,5,Love these.  From the first time I put them on they have been the most comfortable sneaker I’ve ever owned.
Adidas,5,"Love these.  Light, comfortable, and cute.  Hard to find these attributes in a size 12"

Adidas,5,Love these. I did size down a 1/2 size.
Adidas,5,Love these. Very comfortable. Great value!!
Adidas,5,Love these. Very comfortable. I think they are made to wear without socks. I wear with thin socks. Laces come tied but shoes fit without having to worry about tightening laces.

Adidas,5,Love this shoe. It’s super light weight and perfect for running on solid surfaces. Extremely comfortable with more toe room than most other running shoes on the market. Also love the color option.
Adidas,5,Love this style of shoe I have almost all the colors.  I have bad feet so I need extra cushion and this shoe gives that and more!  The shoe does run big I usually wear size 10 but I needed a 9 in this shoe.
Adidas,5,Love this style. SUPER comfy and pretty darn cute. Even my teen daughter wants a pair
Adidas,5,"Love this Tennis Shoe, will order my regular size next time Sketchers run smaller, and wasn't sure about these si I ordered a size larger, and they are alttle big, but will put insoles in them to make them fit better"
Adidas,5,Love this tennis shoes.  Very light and comfortable..
Adidas,5,Love!
Adidas,5,Love!
Adidas,5,"Love!  Adidas normally run a little big so they fit as expected them to fit.  I love that I can put I setts in for my plantar fasciitis and the shoe still fits amazing.  I also have a bunion on my foot so these are great because they don't hurt. I workout a lot and if I can't because my feet hurt I get sad.  Lol.  Love these shoes and I'm ready to buy another adidas shoe.❤️  BTW, I mainly do treadmill walking, stairs and dance fitness classes.  These are fabulous for those things. IMO. :)"

Adidas,5,"Love, Love, Love! My favorite tennis shoes by far! Light weight, soft and comfy."

Adidas,5,Love...fits perfectly and looks exactly as shown!
Adidas,5,Loved how comfortable these are. I have really flat feet & these accommodate pretty well for any arch pain I have been having.

Adidas,5,Loved them
Adidas,5,"Loved them needed exchange runs a bit large however, l need serious ankle support having no reason to have bothered otherwise though bc l'm handicapped. They l must say are attractive easily getting on comfort & wish worn faster but will be exchanging p & just l needed a tighter personal fit. Personal extra ""tight"" fit for support bc l too am very clumsy ! No fault to seller very happy purchse buy them anyone would love these all around wearable tennis shoes! 🥳"

Adidas,5,Loveeeee these shoes. They do fit a tad big so you may want to size down. I will definitely be ordering another pair!

Adidas,5,Loveeeeeeee this sneakers!!!!!!!!!
Adidas,5,Loves them so comfortable . must have all colors .
Adidas,5,Matches my jacket perfectly
Adidas,5,"Maybe somewhat small. Sock/slip on fit. Need to wear thinner socks with them or they’d be too snug. But I love the look and the price is right. If you are looking for arch support, I’m not sure if these are for you. The cloud foams took a bit to get used to. The foam bottoms are definitely different than other shoes"
Adidas,5,Me encantan son mis nuevas compañeras en el gym
Adidas,5,"Me encantaron estos tennis, son muy confortables, los uso para andar de un lado para otro en mi casa, y tambien para salir a caminar. Los primeros que compre me quedaron un poco apretados de los lados. La segunda vez ordene medio numero mas y me quedaron perfectamente bien. Lo que mas me gusto es que no cuestan tanto. Volvere a ordenar mas de diferentes colores , porque tienen una gran variedad de colores. Recomiendo altamente estos tenis."
Adidas,5,"Me encantaron!!!  El color divino. Súper cómodos y se ven súper lindos. Deportivos, pero a la vez con estilo para usarlos del diario. Feliz con mi comprita."

Adidas,5,"My feet are wider than most, and these fit like a dream. They bend with my feet and can withstand a 10 hour work day in a warehouse"
Adidas,5,"My feet don't hurt! I've peripheral neuropathy in both feet. There's numbness in both of my feet so I don't feel friction from foot- ware, but I can and do get blisters/friction burns. Can't have that with neuropathy. These shoes give me support and yet the top material stretches making room for movement of the toes. Size runs true. Smart looking shoes, too."
Adidas,5,My feet usually are sore after being on them all day but not anymore.  I wore these for a 4 day trip to Disney World of walking over 5 miles a day and standing in lines for hours and my feet never hurt.  I was so impressed of how comfortable and how light they were.  The cushion was just what I needed.  Hoping to be able to by more of these (especially at the great sale price I got them) to replace most of my other shoes.  Get these...you won't regret the comfort!!
Adidas,5,"My first pair lasted a year and a half, I wore them often."
Adidas,5,My first pair of Adidas and I may be hooked!
Adidas,5,"My foot is 9 and a half inches long and 3 and a half inches at the widest point. My last tennis shoes was size 10, and some how it worked, but it still was way too big. I bought this in a size 8 and it fit perfectly. My feet are very narrow, but these would work for people with wider feet too. Definitely recommend."

Adidas,5,My girlfriend loves these shoes! She said they are great for walking long periods of time. She definitely would recommend
Adidas,5,"My go to shoe for day to day wear. This is my second pair—I wore out my other pair after 2 yrs of daily wear. Lightweight, easy to slip on, great comfort. I don’t run in them but no issues walking several miles."

Adidas,5,My husband bought me these sneakers for Christmas. I love how comfortable they are! They do run a tad on the small side. I typically wear an 8.5 I should have gotten a size 9.
Adidas,5,My husband got me these for my bday and it was just before we were leaving for spring break to Universal studios. He knew we'd be doing a lot of walking that week so I'd need good shoes. Well these are it! We were there from 9am-10pm on one of the days and my feet didn't hurt at all! These shoes are so comfortable and I love how they slip on. Wore them the whole week we were there. They have become my gym shoes now. I'm obsessed.

Adidas,5,My niece loves them!
Adidas,5,"My second pair because I like them so much. Don’t have to tie them after the first time, you can just slip them on and off. Very comfortable shoes.  I have the black and gray also. Everyone keeps asking me where I got them!"
Adidas,5,"My second pair different color. These reviews on how it’s fake? IT NOT! My other pair is from shoe carnival and it’s exactly the same, fits the the same and it’s styled the same. Best gym shoes I have ever had in my life.  Very comfortable and light."
Adidas,5,My second pair. Adequate cushion and support. Would recommend!
Adidas,5,My shoe size is typically between a 7.5 and 8. I originally ordered an 8 but they were huge— Exchanged for a size 7 and they fit perfect. These are my ‘casual’ shoes to wear and not work out in. Very comfortable.
Adidas,5,My shoes are the best thank you
Adidas,5,"My sister in law had these shoes on a couple of months ago and I fell in love but could not find them in any local stores. She then found this deal on Amazon for me. I have to admit, I was hesitant to buy shoes online because I never have good luck. However, I wanted these so badly I went for it and I was not disappointed. They fit perfectly in the size I am used to wearing, material is great and they are super comfortable!"
Adidas,5,My sister loved them as a gift. I will definitely be getting myself some.
Adidas,5,My son purchased for me for the gym. Quick shipping. I love them

Adidas,5,My wife said she would rate these shoes a 7 out of 5. She said the feel of these shoes gives her more satisfaction than being intimate with me.
Adidas,5,My wife said these are the best walking/ running shoes ever. Super comfy
Adidas,5,"my wife says ""its like walking on clouds""
what more can you ask for?"
Adidas,5,"My wife’s like it. However,  If you are planning on wearing them for working out I will not recommend it."
Adidas,5,My youngest daughter has a pair and recommended them to me. I have a crooked toe which makes finding a comfortable shoe very hard. I usually wear a size 11 which causes pain. I found these shoes and I was able to order an 11.5 which fit perfectly! I'll be ordering another pair very soon.
Adidas,5,Nana approved
Adidas,5,"Need a narrower size.  NA in 9.5 N
Really cushioning.  Wish I could wear them!"

Adidas,5,Nice and got deal
Adidas,5,"Nice and light when running on the treadmill. The support isn't the greatest and I need to use shoe inserts to help support by heels, which helps a ton. Great design for being light on the treadmill or while working out."
Adidas,5,"Nice and lightweight, perfect for daily errand wear or walking/at home fitness. I don’t go to the gym or run so can’t vouch for that. I love the look and the fit, it’s spot on."

Adidas,5,nice shoe not as comfortable as my other adidas shoes
Adidas,5,"Nice shoe, however, if you have a high arch, like i do you will probably not be able to wear the shoe for more than 10 hours consecutively. Less than that fantastic."
Adidas,5,Nice shoe.
Adidas,5,Nice shoes but have only worn for a week. We will see how durable and long they last
Adidas,5,Nice shoes thank you Amazon
Adidas,5,Nice shoes 👍🏼
Adidas,5,Nice sneakers  Not for running though  no support. But are comfortable. I wear a 10 but ordered 9 1/2 and they are comfortable with light socks I would buy another pair but want more colors to pick from
Adidas,5,Nice soft light weight shoes love the color comfortable tennis shoes great price.
Adidas,5,"Nice, casual sneaker. I wouldn’t go jogging in these but they are very nice looking."

Adidas,5,"Nice, just get dirty quick"
Adidas,5,"Nice, light weight, as pictured. Comfy & cute."
Adidas,5,No arch support... you can feel the ground and they are thin soled. I still like them for every day walking around.
Adidas,5,No break in time needed. Just slip them on and go! I love them so much that I’m ordering a pair for my dad. I hope he’ll love them as much as I do.
Adidas,5,no complaints
Adidas,5,No half size
Adidas,5,"No need to tie after you adjust the strings the first time you wear them.  Slip on, lightweight, and comfortable.  Hug you feet, good support.  Would buy again."
Adidas,5,"No new shoe break in time, out of the box and to the gym. Recommended for purchase
Fits true to size"
Adidas,5,"No socks. Slip on. I’ll buy more colors. So comfortable and breathable and weightless.

I did buy a half size down. But, I usually do in Sports Brand runners."
Adidas,5,No son blancos son azul claro pero están muy lindos y muy cómodos son originales
Adidas,5,No son buenos para correr
Adidas,5,No support inside. Having to buy support so the shoes are usable.
Adidas,5,No support. Bottom felt very flimsy and cheap. Not for someone with skinny ankles either.
Adidas,5,"Normally I wear a 7.5-8, I ordered the 7.5 and they fit comfortably, could have even sized down to a 7. These are super comfortable and perfect for athleisure wear, I don’t think they would hold up very well or be comfortable for working out but for casual, running errands type wear they are great."
Adidas,5,Not cushier enough. But for my kid any way.
Adidas,5,"Not for running, but these are the cutest casual sneakers. They’re great when you are running errands but don’t want to look like a complete greasy bum who is nursing a hangover while trying to get things done. Pair with leggings and a cute ath-leisure top and you’ll look like a real person! Sooooo effing comfy too, probably the most cushiony shoes I’ve ever owned"
Adidas,5,"Not great for running, but cute and comfortable for my aging feet that are too tired for classic Vans everyday

I am very happy with my purchase, but saw them at Costco today for $30, just a heads up."
Adidas,5,Not made by Nike
Adidas,5,Not only are these shoes gorgeous but I bought them for working out and they are ridiculously comfortable! I feel like A stay at home mom but I wear them to do my shopping because they’re just so comfy  😂
Adidas,5,"Not only are these shoes super cute, but they’re soooo Comfortable. A must have in every color!"
Adidas,5,Not only is this a very cute shoe it’s also lightweight and comfortable!
Adidas,5,Not sure if these are knock offs or real but I actually dont care because they look awesome and feel great on my feet! And for only $20... I really can't complain! Highly recommend 👍
Adidas,5,Not very supportive but I love these shoes.
Adidas,5,Not what I expected
Adidas,5,nothing
Adidas,5,"Obsessed with cloudfoam shoes! I used these all through nursing school and now as a nurse! So comfortable, and lightweight. I own them in so many colors"
Adidas,5,Obsessed with these shoes! So comfortable and easy to workout in! Getting multiple colors.
Adidas,5,Obsessed with these shoes!! So lightweight and comfortable. I wear them everywhere. They are perfect.
Adidas,5,Obsessed with these! Super comfortable
Adidas,5,Obsessed with these. I have worn Nike shoes for 15+ years and finally found a better more comfortable shoe.
Adidas,5,"OBSESSED!! I work on my feet for 8 hours a day x 5 days a week, and they are so comfortable! Love them!"
Adidas,5,Oh my goodness its super comfortable I even got my sister in law to buy one.
Adidas,5,Oh my gosh I love these sneakers. They literally do feel like clouds. Highly recommend!!
Adidas,5,Oh wow! They are light weight and oh so comfy!!!
Adidas,5,"Ok first the price was excellent, 28$ US. You can’t beat that if they didn’t do the job, but they did. Cloud foam interior kept me comfy and energized during a whole day at DISNEY the concrete fun house. This sneaker has done the job no foot complaints and sit down breaks like with other shoes in the past."
Adidas,5,"Ok so I ordered a 7.5 when typically I am an 8 in shoes but after reading reviews people said the shoe runs big & you can size down a bit. For me it was absolutely true the 7.5 fits perfect with room. The shoes are very cute, trendy & soo comfy, so lightweight no wonder they are called cloud they weigh almost nothing. You can also feel the cushiony foam in the insoles.  I got the whitish ones with black they are so bright white & clean & nice looking I love that!
Only 2 cons are super unnecessarily long laces for the style of shoe so when tied they look a bit awky
& also the shoe doesn’t have a tongue since it’s a slip on sock style which makes it difficult to get it on your foot especially for an elderly person or someone that finds that kinda thing difficult with some shoes.
But I know that’s just the style of the shoe & how they are & I like how they look anyway despite that."
Adidas,5,"Ok so im not a tennis shoe kind of girl,  however these are very stylish and extremely comfy. Im really impressed with these shoes i love them, so much i ordered a second pair"
Adidas,5,Omg I absolutely love it! I do 12 to 14 hr shifts at hospital and this is what I needed! I don't know how long they'll last but they fit me perfectly t feel great and let the air in! I will definitely buy every time I need a pair
Adidas,5,Omg I absolutely love this shoes . It’s super comfortable.
Adidas,5,Omg I love
Adidas,5,"Omg love them!!

So cute, great color in the light grey.

I would say they run a little bigger then Nike. I always buy 7.5 Nike and wish I would have bought 7 in these shoes. But not that big a deal might be good so they can slip on easier."
Adidas,5,Omg these shoes fit amazingly and super comfortable!
Adidas,5,On day 2 in Disney World and these shoes are so comfortable!! My feet never hurt in these shoes!! Such a great purchase and would definitely recommend.
Adidas,5,On my feet for 10hrs at work no sit down job and it keeps my feet comfortable like these shoes so much going to purchase another pair just for when I go to store or walking
Adidas,5,one of my new favorite pairs of shoes! I size down 1/2 size from my normal street shoe size for all adidas shoes i buy. always fit as expected! this is a beautiful white sneaker - not disappointed!!
Adidas,5,"One of the best durable,comfortable shoes I own!!! Light weight and cute!!! Highly recommend..."
Adidas,5,One of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. I love the look and feel of these. My current favorite show.
Adidas,5,Order a half size down from your regular size. Shoes are comfy probably not running shoes more like walking.
Adidas,5,Order a size smaller
Adidas,5,"Order half size larger than you normally wear. For look only, I don't think I'd run in them."
Adidas,5,"Ordered a half size down and they fit perfect! Extremely comfortable to wear all day, but not very supportive for working out, or running."
Adidas,5,Ordered for my wife. We needed to return and get a size down. Runs just a touch in the large size. But really nice shoes.
Adidas,5,Ordered half size smaller. Breathable and my back doesn’t hurt after wearing them for 8+ hours
Adidas,5,Ordered my 11 year old niece a pair for Christmas couldn’t believe she wore my size so I tried them on and they are Comfortable & very stylish so light in weight you can’t tell you have shoes on so my daughter & sister tried them on & we all 3 ordered a pair for the comfort I would have expected them to be over $100 dollars they are under $50 best deal of the year
Adidas,5,"Ordered my normal size 7, perfect,  and so comfy!!!"
Adidas,5,Ordered my normal size and they quickly became my favorite running shoes. & are cute enough as just regular any day shoes too
Adidas,5,Ordered on a whim and wasn’t disappointed. They are so comfy and a great support at the gym.
Adidas,5,Ordered these for myself as I desperately needed a new pair of sneakers for work. They are very comfy and well worth the money. I'd recommend these shoes to anyone who spends most of their days on their feet
Adidas,5,Ordered these with Amazon wardrobe.  The fit is great and they are comfortable.  I kept the size 6.
Adidas,5,Original order was lost but second order was received within a couple of days and the shoes fit perfect.  Very comfortable.
Adidas,5,"Our daughter is a varsity basketball player.  Most players finish practice and go to their ""slides"".  She wanted something that was easy to slip into but still secure as she has to drive about 30 miles to the practice facility.

She loves them and wears them all the time.  Around the house, running errands, pre & post practice.  She says that they are super comfortable.  Highly Recommend."
Adidas,5,"Overall good shoe. Not as much cushion as I thought, but still comfortable. Good price. Can get dirty easy."
Adidas,5,Overall very comfy.
Adidas,5,"Own multiple pairs and in different colors.  Very comfortable!

UPDATE Ordered another pair in a different color and the fit and comfort are exceptional"
Adidas,5,"Per reviews, I ordered half size down. Usually wear 10, got 9.5. Wouldn’t be a running shoe, great for running errands, Walks with dogs. Doesn’t have a physical tongue so can’t adjust or make tighter, only with laces."
Adidas,5,Perfect

Adidas,5,"PERFECT FIT... MOST COMFORTABLE SNEAKER I HAVE EVER HAD ...
ARRIVED ON TIME ..."
Adidas,5,Perfect fit...EXCELLENT WEARING SHOES
Adidas,5,"Perfect for casual wear, they are my go-to shoes for running errands when I know I’ll be walking a lot! Super comfy!"
Adidas,5,Perfect for everyday wear but not a lot of support for heavy exercise. Seems a little long in the toe bed but that’s okay as I’d rather have a little wiggle room. I like that the back of the shoe comes up higher but is made of flexible materials so it doesn’t cause rubbing or sores on the heel or ankle.
Adidas,5,Perfect for long walks.
Adidas,5,Perfect for my daughter
Adidas,5,Perfect for my foot size shape and balance.
Adidas,5,Perfect for running and workout
Adidas,5,Perfect for running errands.
Adidas,5,"Perfect for summer. No sock needed. Would purchase half size up if wearing a slim sock. Wear all the time with shorts, long skirts or short skirts. Great purchase."
Adidas,5,Perfect normal I wear size 7 but I order 61/2  and fit me perfect
Adidas,5,Perfect pair of shoes! These are so light and comfy! My favorite for sure!
Adidas,5,Perfect running or walking  shoe.

Adidas,5,Perfect shoe for every day wear and working. Out! Love!
Adidas,5,Perfect shoe if your on your feet all day. Very comfortable. True to size . Love the shoe.
Adidas,5,"Perfect shoe, it make my feet looks smaller."
Adidas,5,"Perfect shoes for low profile sneaker. These are super lightweight and flexible. I would say excellent for pavement running only as these are thin. I normally wear 8.5 but ordered an 8. I wear them barefoot mostly or low profile socks. Definitely would purchase again when I wear these out. They are light colored and neutral so I wear them all the time in summer. When they start to get dirty I throw them in the delicate speed wash and they stay looking new! Once dry, I spray with a shoe protector and let dry completely! This helps keep them looking better for longer!"
Adidas,5,"Perfect shoes to wear in pandemic while working from home.
Can wear at desk at home and for a quick trip to grocery store and a quick walk of the dog.
2nd pair I’ve purchased"
Adidas,5,Perfect sneaker. Easy on; great for traveling and long walks.

Adidas,5,"Perfect! I haven't bought a pair of running sneakers for over ten years bc I simply didn't like the way they looked.  These, however, are so nice. Just as pictured. The color is a very light pale Gray, and accented with white. They do lace but really slip on. They can be worn with low socks and you don't see the socks at all. They're a casual shoe, not just a running shoe, so they can be worn with cute clothes and still look nice. Not just for running."
Adidas,5,Perfect! I’ve bought these twice.  Very comfortable with or without socks.  Easy to clean and durable.
Adidas,5,Perfect! Super comfy and love the way they look!
Adidas,5,Perfect!!
Adidas,5,Perfecto
Adidas,5,Personally had to size a half size down. Nice comfortable fit. Went hiking in the mountains with them and they were sturdy enough for rocky terrain but flexible enough for comfort. Nice and light weight. The slip on and off design along with the flexible fabric top are very comfortable.
Adidas,5,Picked these up for my wife. Nailed the size and everything. She says they are super comfortable and now we can train for our race!!
Adidas,5,Plan to get another pair! So comfy
Adidas,5,Pleasantly surprised!

Adidas,5,"Purchased for my daughter who is a nurse, she really likes them!"
Adidas,5,"purchased for my wife, who is super-picky about shoes and fit and feel.  These are her favorite shoes.  She was skeptical because the heel lip was so pronounced (big) but these are amazingly comfortable and fit as expected."
Adidas,5,"Purchased these for my teenage daughter. She says these are the most comfortable shoes shes ever had! She wears one pair of sneakers every day, all day, until they wear out and these are currently at the 3 month mark and still looking good."

Adidas,5,Really comfortable. They run about a half size big.
Adidas,5,"Really comfy, easy on and off - I had back surgery and was tired of having to ask someone to help me put my tennis shoes on, lol. Also I wanted a tennis shoe with a good sole for alot of walking as opposed to a traditional slip on shoe.  At first it was a little bit trying to get them on without bending over, but after wearing them for a week, it is easy to slip in and out of them. Not bad arch support, but will probably add insoles at a later date."
Adidas,5,Really cute AND comfortable!
Adidas,5,Really cute and fit well. The 11.5 was perfect. I typically order a 12.
Adidas,5,Really cute shoe. They were too big but my daughter wanted to keep them rather than return them. I’m concerned about the wrong fit. But her old shoes she wore without putting her heel in so I guess I’m glad she puts her whole foot in it.  So I cannot comment on the correct fit but my daughter really likes them. They are well made.
Adidas,5,"Really cute tennis shoes! They are a perfect fit and just as I expected.
After arriving two weeks later from being lost in transit, it was worth the wait.
Definitely using them for work, as well as everyday life."
Adidas,5,Really good sneakers. Bought at my exact size and it fits perfect.. didnt need a smaller size. Material looks and feels like very good quality and its really comfortable.
Adidas,5,Really lightweight shoe. Comfortable
Adidas,5,Really like it buying again
Adidas,5,"Really liking these new kicks. 😊 comfy, well made, cute."
Adidas,5,"Really love these shoes , I’m always either a 8.5 or an 8 but i got the 8.5 just to be safe but i honestly could’ve gone with the smaller size. I did try them on without socks and the back part didn’t slip off so i didn’t see a reason to need to return them."
Adidas,5,"Really needed some decent looking black sneakers after foot surgery. These look nice and they are super comfy, with some kind of foamy padding on the sole."
Adidas,5,Really nice I love it!
Adidas,5,"Really nice shoe! Comfortable, cheap and they look great! My sister bought the same pair and she loved them too. I do recommend. They look high-end without the price tag"

Adidas,5,Received 👍🏽
Adidas,5,"Recieved fast, lived shoes and the fit."
Adidas,5,Run slightly big but super cute.
Adidas,5,Runs a little big
Adidas,5,Runs a little large. I’m normally a 9/9 and 1/2 and I had to get a 8 and 1/2 and there was still a lot of room in the toe. This shoe is very lightweight and stylish! Very comfortable for running!
Adidas,5,"Runs a little small, maybe 1/2  size.  Very comfortable!  Very light weight, yet supportive!!"
Adidas,5,Runs a size big. I’m normally an 11 and it was way to big. Bought a 10 and fits perfect. I use them for normal day to day activities. Haven’t used them to workout in. Comfortable for a wider foot too
Adidas,5,Runs big. Needed to return. Beware you have to pay to ship it back. It was 17 bucks to do that.
Adidas,5,"Runs slightly big. I tried on my usual size 7.5 in store and since they don’t really “tie” I went down a half size and they fit perfect with no show thin socks. Not sure about how they are with any kind of exercise or running, haven’t had them long enough."
Adidas,5,Runs slightly larger than normal but adidas typically does for me. Very comfortable.
Adidas,5,Runs true to size! These feel great on and look great too!

Adidas,5,"So comfortable that I have two pair.  They are true-to-size.  In my opinion, only 2 slight cons:  the front comes up high on your foot, so that may bother some people, and very little arch support  (I just add my own insert).  Love these shoes!"

I could have ordered a 6 in these and been a little better off, but I'm keeping g them anyways. I'll order another pair for sure."

Adidas,5,So comfy! I got these shoes because they’re slip ons after a hip replacement. They are wonderful. I wear them to the gym and around town. They fit true to size and seem like good quality. I want to see if they hold up around the pinky toes (might rip) and see if they rip around the shoe lace holes
Adidas,5,"So comfy! I ordered my true size of 8.5 because of the reviews and they are perfect! I almost always wear a size 9 because I have a super high Arch and a wide foot, but these run slightly bigger so the 8.5 was just right."

Adidas,5,Such a great slip on shoe.  I ordered a size 12... perfect.  Love the look and feel.  Tons of compliments

Adidas,5,Super comfortable and perfect fit! I had a pair of cloud foam adidas in the past and fell in love so decided to get another pair. These are even better because the tongue is sewn in and doesn’t move around which I love.
Adidas,5,"Super comfortable and true to size. Also very attractive, and make my slightly wide foot look narrow. I’m not much of a walker but I walked all around NYC in these and my feet, bad knee and back were fine. LOVE."
Adidas,5,Super comfortable and very light on my feet.
Adidas,5,"Super comfortable shoes, just love them"
Adidas,5,"Super comfortable shoes. A little wide if you have narrow feet, but not bad."

Adidas,5,Super comfortable! Love these shoes!
Adidas,5,Super comfortable!!
Adidas,5,"Super comfortable, and cute. I do a lot of working out and tear shoes up VERY easily, these have remained in great condition and I’ve had them for 3 months. I usually have to buy new shoes every 3 weeks to 7 weeks."
Adidas,5,"Super comfortable, and the back of the shoe is high enough where my ankle socks don't fall down all the time!"
Adidas,5,"Super comfortable, I wear them to work every single day and I’m always on my feet. Just got a another job where I have to wear white shoes so I just bought another in white. I definitely recommend, doubt this is a purchase you’d regret they’re cute and practical. That’s why I now have two pairs lol"
Adidas,5,"Super comfortable, super lightweight, love the shoes for walking. I don’t feel my foot Is narrow but I do have to tighten the strings to wear the shoes wrinkle on top of my foot. I don’t mind and it doesn’t bother me.I would buy them again."
Adidas,5,Super comfortable.
Adidas,5,Super comfortable. I usually do at home workouts and these are perfect for it. They’re easy to get on and off too
Adidas,5,Super comfortable. I'd say half a size big.. I normally wear a 8.5 in nike and ordered the 8.5 in these and they are a little big but not anything that made me exchange sizes. Doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my feet. LOVE!
Adidas,5,Super comfortable. Love that I can slip these on easily even when tied. I wear a 9 normally but always size up a half size in tennis shoes. These fit exactly as expected.
Adidas,5,Super comfortable. Was disappointed I had to return because they were too big. I wear a woman’s sneaker size of 8-8.5. I bought 8.5 and it was at least an inch longer than the tips of my toes. Most likely will repurchase in a size 8.
Adidas,5,Super comfortable. Will definitely buy another pair in a different color

Adidas,5,Super comfy and cute
Adidas,5,"Super comfy and cute. Feel like bedroom slippers. Just don’t use them for exercise walking. My calves HURT for three days because they are looser fitting. It’s like trying to walk in flip flops. But for daily wear, they are awesome!!"
Adidas,5,Super comfy and easy to put on! They have a slight stretch to them :)
Adidas,5,"Super comfy and easy to put on.  As a mom on the go I like that I feel stylish while in comfort.  I would not wear these to work out, simply because I like to workout hard.  I need more support than these offer."
Adidas,5,Super comfy and easy to slip on!
Adidas,5,Super comfy and light weight. Haven’t worked out in it so I can say for that but super comfy
Adidas,5,Super Comfy and lightweight  love them

Adidas,5,Super comfy shoes. Weightless
Adidas,5,"Super comfy
My new favorite weekend warrior shoes"
Adidas,5,Super comfy!
Adidas,5,Super Comfy!
Adidas,5,Super comfy!

Adidas,5,Súper comodos
Adidas,5,Super cute
Adidas,5,Super cute & comfortable.
Adidas,5,Super cute and comfortable 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Adidas,5,"Super cute and comfortable! However, they run big. I normally wear a 7.5 and need a size 7."
Adidas,5,"Super cute and comfortable! Very light weight shoe! I’ve worked out in them a few times and while running errands. The soles are a little thin so I wouldn’t suggest using these for hiking or trail running. IMO they run a little big, I originally ordered these in a 10 and had to go down a half size because my feet were swimming in them. I like that there is no tongue because I don’t have to adjust it through out the day."
Adidas,5,Super cute and comfortable. Easy to slip on and off. Thinking of getting a second pair
Adidas,5,Super cute and comfortable. Great to pair with jeans. I like that they're slip-on but with laces.

Adidas,5,Super cute and comfy with affordable price
Adidas,5,Super cute and comfy. A little more snug than alll my others and I always buy this shoe but I love the color.
Adidas,5,Super cute and fits true to size.  Not as comfy as I had expected though.
Adidas,5,"Super cute and I’m replacing the shoelaces with shorter pink ones. I will say that adidas normally run true to size for me. These 7.5’s fit more like an 8. I read the reviews about them having no support or durable soles. I have really high arches and I wear an insole for that anyway so that’s not an issue. Also for those who also like insoles, there’s plenty of room for that. I’ve found other brands don’t always have comfortable space to add an insole without removing the factory lining."
Adidas,5,Super cute and super comfortable!
Adidas,5,"Super cute and very comfortable. Perfect for running errands or going on walks with my dogs.
Wouldn’t recommend wearing these for running though as they don’t provide a ton of support in my opinion."
Adidas,5,"Super cute shoes ! Good quality, light weight and very comfortable. I am almost always a size 9, I ordered an 8 1/2 and they fit perfectly! Would buy again!"
Adidas,5,Super cute! As pictured and great price!
Adidas,5,"Super cute! I sized up because most running shoes pinch my big toe but I have ample room to move around in it, and comfortably too!"
Adidas,5,"Super cute!
But I’m leaving this positive review for more than just the product quality/satisfaction (both of which I’m exceedingly pleased with 🙂). Instead, I want to compliment and share my experience with the most ridiculously simple online return process in which I’ve ever taken part in.

So, before I brag about how easy this was, here are the details-...last weekend, I ordered a (different) pair of Adidas (A1)...only to realize upon receipt that I completely and totally overlooked the fact that they were made in wide-fit sizes ONLY! (I thought the title mention of “wide” was simply stating that wide-fit was an OPTION in with A1,and not the rule; the typical “W” noted after the shoe size {American sizes anyway}- i.e. “8.5W”-would usually be displayed in the size drop-down menu, thus identifying the fit of each pair! Basically- No “W”? Regular fit. Yes “W”? Wide fit.)So when I received A1 and saw how big they were I was so disappointed, as I’ve been looking forward to receiving them for quite awhile now. The style for which this particular review is being posted- A2- was actually my second choice, thus my go-to when A1 didn’t exactly work out and I needed to determine an exchange. This process was INCREDIBLY SIMPLE! While I’m definitely thrilled with A2’s style+fit, I’m so so so much more than satisfied with the swap process as well. I simply specified the parameters of my return - options include: return A1 for refund, only exchange A1 for a different size in the same style, or exchange A1 for a totally different item (with the under/over $ amounts simply being charged or refunded). I selected the latter option of exchanging A1 for a pair of similarly priced A2s and was then given return instructions for the A1s. I assumed that, upon receipt of the returned pair, they would then get the A2s sent out; however, after processing the exchange on Amazon on Wednesday (6/10), I’ve actually just today (Friday 6/12) already received the new pair before even having the opportunity to get to post office to send back the pair originally ordered A1s.
Excellent turn around. Simple process.

Why must you be so amazing, Amazon?! The ease in which everything is done and the amazing convenience means I’m on here spending/ordering far more often than I really need to be haha but in all seriousness, I’m thoroughly satisfied and so pleased with every aspect of this transaction. You guys rock! xx"
Adidas,5,Super cute. Has reflector bits all over but it makes it almost look like little sparkles which I love glitter. I love that it just has a hint of pink to make it more feminine. Would buy again

Adidas,5,The perfect shoe. True to size. Super comfy. Easy to slide on and off. Would buy every color if I could!

Adidas,5,The perfect workout sneaker.
Adidas,5,The product was received in a good conditions
Adidas,5,The shoe has the look of a lace up shoe while also functioning as a slip on shoe. Extremely comfortable during walks with dog and running. Highly recommend.
Adidas,5,The shoe is reallt cute  and lightweight.  The drawback is that they are huge.  I would say a whole size bigger.  I will not be keeping them.  The seller however was very quick.
Adidas,5,"The shoe is so light! As far as fit, they are nice and tight but if my feet were a little fatter I don’t thing they would have fit. Definitely for slimmer feet."
Adidas,5,The shoe is very light and comfortable. It is also very durable. The size fits alright but the cutting might make the fitting less comfortable for some people.
Adidas,5,The shoe runs a little big so I downsized. I normally wear an 8 but purchased a size 7. The shoe is great for all day wear. Very stylish and comfortable. I’ve received several compliments on them!

Adidas,5,"The shoes are great. I like the feel of them under my feet when I run. This is a great purchase, you will not disappointed."

Adidas,5,The shoes is perfect. Feels like a slipper and yet provides support.

Adidas,5,The shoes were great for my daughter for gym class and for other things as well. They are very comfortable and fit great. They give lots of support for my daughter during gym and school.
Adidas,5,"The shoes were perfect! However I did have to return due to sizing. I think adidas do run a half size bigger. I’m consistently an 8.5 in sneakers but ordered and 8. When I finally got the right size they were perfect. Super comfy and breathable. I think I’ve worn these about 3x in the last week since purchasing. Nice shoe! Great addition to my closet. You can wear to workout or just wear with a relaxing outfit. I’m not sure how these will hold up running because I don’t think they have THAT much support but def HIIT and strengthening workouts, you’ll be fine! Oh, they also are more of a slip on shoe, so I would def make sure you get your correct size! Would recommend!"
Adidas,5,"The size fit perfectly for my foot! I love the colors, the feel of the shoe and it forms great around my foot! I use them for when I’m at work in the hospital and they are super comfy and easy to move around in. Especially in emergency situations!"

Adidas,5,The support is great! Fit as expected! I was looking for easy to put on shoes and these are them!!
Adidas,5,The support is pretty good. They are very comfortable!  Lightweight too. It feels like i put a pair of slippers on!

Adidas,5,The wife loves them
Adidas,5,Theeeeee most comfortable pair of shoes you’ll ever purchase
Adidas,5,There are so comfortable and easy to get on. They have great support.
Adidas,5,"There are very light and easy to get on!
Granddaughter wears them everyday!"
Adidas,5,"There is a lot of cushion. It is lacking on the arch support, but I have plantar fasciitis so I have my own inserts."
Adidas,5,"There is everything to like about this shoe!  This is the second pair & same color i have bought.  They are lightweight, fit true, go with everything, super supportive & lets not forget to mention cute!!"
Adidas,5,"There is nothing better than this lightweight, comfortable shoe. This is my second pair and I will definitely buy again!!!"
Adidas,5,There is nothing I dislike about these shoes.  They look great and fit perfectly.
Adidas,5,There’s shoes are very comfortable.  The slide on easy.  I love that the back of shoe around the heel is high for support.  The shoes fitted as expected.  They are great for walking and standing long periods of time as well as working out. The shoes strings were a little long but you are able to tuck into shoes with no issues.
Adidas,5,"These Adidas are so comfortable! I usually wear an 8, but I ordered an 8.5 instead and I'm glad I did. I have wide feet and these shoes are made a little bit wide anyway so the 8.5 was perfect. You can barely tell you have anything on your feet. Also, if you have neuropathy, like I do, you can't go wrong with these!"
Adidas,5,These ads lightweight and comfortable!
Adidas,5,These are a dream to wear. Very light and comfortable. I bought them for every day wearers.
Adidas,5,"These are a God sent for me!  I am thankful Amazon has so many shoes with free returns... I've tried on about 30 pairs and sent them all back except the 3 I'm reviewing!  These are perfect with no binding on my joint condition of my large toe.  I can't wear anything that puts pressure on the top of my foot since my feet have changed so much at age 60.  I put them on and had absolutely no pain...anywhere!  I have osteoarthritis and lots of painful area's on me and these will be like walking on a cloud and help my hips too!  Hope they hold up well...  I am thankful I can walk still and am looking forward to the mile walks I do!  These would fit a medium width foot too as I tightened up the laces since I'm a AA narrow and have no arches.  I just added my orthodontic insert to the shoe right over their pad since mine are 1/2 and not full size supports and a perfect fit! The arch support isn't enough for me, but a ""normal"" foot it would be fine!"
Adidas,5,"These are a tad too mig, but nothing crazy. I prefer Some room in my shoes. My foot is anywhere between a 6.5 and a 7, depending on the shoe, and this feeling closer to a 7-7.5. Over great shoe. Get great compliments. Feels wonderful! Also, easy to put one as they are slip on."
Adidas,5,"These are absolutely my favorite shoes. Comfortable, lightweight, and good looking shoe. I wear them everyday. Will be buying in a different color soon."
Adidas,5,These are amazing for weekend wear! Not so much for workouts or running. I did size down. I normally wear 7 but 6.5 was better fit.
Adidas,5,These are amazing shoes. They are super comfortable and very durable! Highly recommend!
Adidas,5,These are amazing!
Adidas,5,These are amazing! So comfy and great to workout in! I sized down a half size and I’m glad I did! I think I could’ve gone down a whole size. But overall great pair of shoes! Highly recommend!
Adidas,5,These are amazing! So comfy! Feels like a glove when wearing. I like them for my daily walks!
Adidas,5,These are AMAZING!!! The sizing and style is just perfect. They’re light and great for workout! Highly recommended!
Adidas,5,These are amazing. Fit perfectly and don’t hurt.
Adidas,5,These are amazing. It's very difficult for me to buy shoes because my right foot is swollen. These slide right on and are super comfortable. Also they take the swelling out of my foot. Not just push it up into my leg.
Adidas,5,These are amazing. So comfortable!
Adidas,5,"These are amazing. They’re cute, they slip on and can be tightened with the laces. They are so comfy! Love them."
Adidas,5,"These are awesome!  I’m third trimester pregnant so I need slip ons, but these are true to my non-pregnant size so they’re going to be perfect for now and after the baby, too. Comfortable, good arch support, super cute. I would give these 12 stars if I could."
Adidas,5,These are awesome! They are very easy to put on and take off and are great for walking and/or hiking. These are stylish and sleek.
Adidas,5,These are by far my favorite casual sneaker. Comfy and light. I love they slip on and off. I ordered them in in 6 and 6 1/2. I kept the 6 1/2 which is what I typically wear. True to size fit for sure.
Adidas,5,These are by far the best running/walking shoes I’ve ever owned. I have wide feet and they still fit amazingly. I’ve had them for a while and I thought man I really need to review them.
Adidas,5,These are by far the most comfortable shoes ever!!
Adidas,5,"These are comfortable and I had tried them on in a store before ordering. Very disappointed in how they arrived though, as shown in pictures. For what I paid, I would expect better care. Won’t order from same company again."
Adidas,5,"These are comfortable, fit as expected (size 7.5), and look nice with leggings, jeans, and shorts. Plus for some reason this color was only $30. Not sure I'd feel the same about them if I had paid $80."
Adidas,5,"These are comfortable, lightweight, and nice to look at! I love the color options and they go with everything!"
Adidas,5,these are comfy and very light weight. they are true to size
Adidas,5,These are comfy shoes. I wouldn’t use them to workout because I need more support. I wear them everyday just walking around and taking the dog out. Love them!
Adidas,5,These are comfy sneakers with little support. I love the way they look. I would never run in them but they’re fine to walk in. Order a size smaller.
Adidas,5,"These are cute and light weight athletic shoe.  I purchased to wear for an upcoming overseas trip as I wanted a shoe that was light weight, comfy and stylish.  As other reviewers mentioned they are not very cushioned for a shoe that says it's cloudfoam.  I would expect a lot more cushioning in the ball of the foot area.  Another reviewer commented that the sole in the ball area of her shoe wore out pretty quickly and I can see that being possibly as they do seem rather thin.  I am going to take my chances seeing as they weren't expensive shoes and hope that doesn't happen."
Adidas,5,These are cute and very comfy. I have been wearing them for a week now and LOVE THEM. They do run a little large but I am doing fine in my normal size. These are super lightweight so if you like support these are probably not the best shoes for you. I am on my feet at work a ton and haven't had the foot pain I had in my last tennis shoes (asics). They essentially feel like being barefoot. I just hope they hold up well to everyday use (my last shoes made it 6 months).
Adidas,5,These are cute and worth the money. The memory foam part is nice too.
Adidas,5,These are cute but I have no idea why people think they are comfortable! The cushion is almost non-existent. They would be fine for running errands maybe. I returned.
Adidas,5,"These are cute, casual, and practical. If you can size down, I’d go down half a size."
Adidas,5,"These are dope. Really light, easy to slide on. Definitely not supportive at all so if you’re already suffering from support issues like weak ankles I would highly recommend not working out in these. I just got them for long shifts at the hospital and they hold up great for that purpose. But for running I don’t think they’d be nearly supportive enough on the arches to be considered a safe running shoe. Very good for weight training though."
Adidas,5,These are extremely comfortable but it doesn’t have any arch support. I wouldn’t use these for a long run but definitely pop them on to run errands.I typically wear a size 7 but had to get a 6.5
Adidas,5,These are fantastic and super comfy and slide on really easy. The memory foam on the inside is so comfy and none of my previous sneakers have had arch support this good. I lile that it isnt too chunky under the heel so they could be used for some lifting as well. Size as expected. Feet dont get too hot with the memory foam insoles because the fabric of the shoe is so breathable and light weight. 10/10 would recommend
Adidas,5,These are fantastic for work all day on my feet! So comfortable and easy to slip on/off
Adidas,5,These are great
Adidas,5,These are great everyday sneakers . I wear them to work for my 12 hour shifts and love them. I don't think they have enough support for working out though
Adidas,5,"These are great for every day comfortable walking activity, but I do not recommend them to run in. There really isn't enough cushion to support the shock and pounding of a run. I love wearing them as they are stylish and fun!"
Adidas,5,These are great for walking around but I would not wear them to work out.
Adidas,5,"These are great for work & so stylish
Look great with scrubs"
Adidas,5,"These are great light weight shoes. I mostly where them for errands. If you need a lot of stability in the bottom of your shoe, these might not be for you.
I need light weight shoes because I have a problem with my hip. I don’t think I would like these for a 10 hour day running around though."
Adidas,5,These are great shoes as long as you get the right size since you can’t adjust them much. Go a half size or even a full size down if you lien you running shoes snug. But they look great and last!
Adidas,5,"These are great shoes for short walks and look great to throw on as you are stepping out of the house. While I originally bought them for running, I ended up using them for daily wear instead (since they aren't supportive as I need). I've already bought three different colors and plan to buy more in the future."
Adidas,5,"These are great shoes for the price, simple and comfortable! They are very lightweight and easy to take on and off, they Just slip right on and off!  These go with everything so I wear them a lot!!! I wouldn’t recommend these for running but more for leisure activity!!"
Adidas,5,These are great shoes for travel!
Adidas,5,These are great shoes! Comfortable and cute. Only thing I would change is the back heel. It comes up a little high but no big deal. These shoes are my new favorites.
Adidas,5,These are great shoes.  Light weight but good support.  Very comfortable!

Adidas,5,These are literally the most comfortable gym shoes I've ever worn! I'm hoping to find these in a couple different colors!
Adidas,5,These are literally the most comfortable shoes ever  I’m a waitress and these are what I wear on hard concrete floors averaging about 10k steps a shift. They have great grip which basically makes them non slips. They have incredible cushion and support better than anything I’ve found from a regular service industry shoe. These are like walking on air; my feet still feel amazing after those 10k steps.
Adidas,5,These are more lavender than mauve. They are nice and comfortable! The price was great!
Adidas,5,"These are my absolute favorite shoes. I can wear them all day without my feet hurting. I have them in 2 colors so far, plan to get more! They run true to size!"
Adidas,5,These are my absolute favorite tennis shoes! Extremely comfortable and easy to put on and take off. They are top quality.  I will be ordering again!

Adidas,5,"these are my favorite shoe! I have them in 3 different colors. Great fit and comfort. I went to Disney World for a week and walked 60 miles, these shoes were perfect for it! so comfortable"
Adidas,5,These are my favorite shoes ever! Super comfortable and light weight!! Wore these on my trip to Universal Studios and my feet didn’t hurt a bit after long day day walking.
Adidas,5,These are my favorite shoes I own! This is the second color I have purchased in these exact shoes. They are so comfortable and I love how easy they are to slip on and off. I loved the first pair so much I bought this second pair just to wear around my house as “house shoes”.
Adidas,5,"These are my FAVORITE shoes!! I love that they are a slide-on! I'm a size 7.5 but typically size up to an 8 in tennis shoes. If you're like me, DO NOT DO THAT WITH THESE! They will be too big."
Adidas,5,"these are my FAVORITE shoes, on my 4 th pair"
Adidas,5,These are my favorite shoes.  Highly recommend.
Adidas,5,"These are my favorite shoes.  They are light, comfy and fit perfectly"
Adidas,5,"These are my favorite shoes. For every day, working out, all of it!"
Adidas,5,These are my favorite shoes. I wear an 8.5 and they are a bit roomy. I suggest ordering a half size smaller than normal.
Adidas,5,These are my favorite sneakers for everyday wear. I love how comfortable they are! May not be the best for running but for everyday wear they cannot be beat and BONUS you dont have to tie them!
Adidas,5,These are my FAVORITE sneakers for running! They are super lightweight and fit perfectly.
Adidas,5,These are my favorite sneakers they are do cute and I wear them with everything
Adidas,5,These are my favorite tennis shoes ever. They are light weight and they slip on easily. They are great for working out or daily wear. Very comfortable and they look great. I’ve bought two pairs so far and will buy more soon!
Adidas,5,"These are my favorite tennis shoes! So comfortable, light weight & cute!"
Adidas,5,"These are my favorite walking and workout shoes!! Amazingly comfortable and breathable as well as plenty of support for a shoe made of softer materials.
When my old pair from
Kohl’s got old I immediately ordered another. My Kohl’s were wide fit, fine for walking, and my Amazon’s are more slim and more supportive for daily running."
Adidas,5,"These are my favorite walking shoes very comfortable. Since they do stretch, I recommend sizing half a size down if you are between sizes."
Adidas,5,"These are my first pair of Adidas, so I was skeptical as to how they would fit and feel. They have turned out to be amazingly comfortable. I am flat footed, and feel as if I have good support in these shoes. I have worn them all day at work (I work in a medical clinic so I am constantly on my feet) without an issue. I have yet to use them for running, but I imagine they will be fine."
Adidas,5,"These are my go to work shoes. I work 12 hr shifts and I'm on my feet constantly. I have flat narrow feet, I'm size 8 1/2 and that's the size I ordered and they fit great. I always try and scoop these up when they're on sale."
Adidas,5,"These are my go-to, most comfortable tennis shoes. so easy to just slip on and go. These are great for walking, doing housework, general day wear. I doubt these have proper support for running or heavy exercise. I have two pair in different colors."
Adidas,5,"These are my new everyday shoes. As a busy mom I needed something cute and comfy to wear out while doing errands or going to the park and these are perfect! They are so comfy and lightweight. Easy to get on and off. Highly recommend these shoes. I did size down a half size than I normally wear and glad I did, they fit perfect."
Adidas,5,"These are my new favorite shoes and I think I’m obsessed because I have 5 pairs lol.
They’re so comfortable and fit great. I may buy more colors if the price drops."
Adidas,5,These are my new favorite shoes! I even ordered another pair in a different color! SO lightweight and comfortable!!
Adidas,5,"These are my new go to tennis shoes. Super comfy, easy to put on since the tongue is sewn in. Can stand on my feet all day in these shoes and my feet do not get hot. Great for walking the dogs in. I already ordered a second pair."
Adidas,5,"These are my new to go to shoes! Love the quick convenience of a slip on. I wouldn’t wear them for jogging, but they are perfect for daily wear."
Adidas,5,"These are my second pair, they are so comfortable that a bought another pair in a different color."
Adidas,5,These are my third pair of shoes. They are lightweight and supportive! Very comfortable as well!
Adidas,5,These are not running shoes. But work amazing for walking!! I have in 3 colors.
Adidas,5,These are perfect
Adidas,5,"These are perfect shoes for me.  Okay, if they were laceless, that would be great too, but these are like walking on air and I forget I have them on.  I'm going to buy another pair in a different color just for fun.  You just can't get a more comfortable shoe for my feet."
Adidas,5,"These are PERFECT!  Bought for a euro trip and wanted lightweight sneaker for all the walking.  These were exactly what I needed.  They look great, feel great, and were easy to pack!  Probably going to buy the burgundy ones too."
Adidas,5,These are precious. They run a little narrow. I usually wear a 7.5 but probably could have sized up to a 8 or even 8.5.
Adidas,5,"These are probably the most comfortable athletic shoes I’ve ever had. Super light weight, great arch support, stylish, with quick slip on. I walked about a mile with no socks and they never rubbed on the back of my heel.  No discomfort. I typically wear size 7 which is what I ordered. Pretty true to size. Ironically, I saw these at my local Costco today right after receiving from Amazon. The cost was comparable, but I saw they we’re selling out quickly. That’s a good sign. I’d buy these again if I found another color!"
Adidas,5,"These are probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I read some other reviews prior to purchasing that said they would not make good workout shoes and I completely agree, they are best for walking around or casual use. I go to Disneyland often and can walk around for hours in these and still feel like I'm walking on a cloud. Highly recommend!"
Adidas,5,"These are probably the most comfortable tennis shoes I have ever owned. I have a high arch, so I have trouble sometimes finding shoes that really give me support. After COVID, my job changed and I went from a mostly desk job to a job where I was on my feet every day in a more physical environment, so I had to buy new sneakers after realizing how much my old ones were making my feet hurt. This review is actually for my second pair. The first pair I bought were white and I have worn them almost daily for a year. I bought a black pair just because they wouldn't show dirt quite as much. My white pair still have great support. PROS: great arch support, comfortable memory foam, pull on where you don't have to tie them- because I'm lazy- but they do have ties so it looks like regular tennis shoes, and they're washable (at least I washed my white pair and they looked great afterwards).... CONS: Don't know if I would want to run or do some hard exercising in these because they don't actually tie to get tight. But for walking and general daily use, I highly recommend."
Adidas,5,These are really cute and the price is fantastic! I like these better than my $120 bikes that ended up smelling musty no matter what I tried to fix it.
Adidas,5,These are really great shoes for the price.  The sole if comfortable and the shoe itself flexes with your movement.
Adidas,5,These are so awesome I love them. They are essentially slip on's so they are super easy to take off and put on. I am going to buy another color!
Adidas,5,These are so awesome that my wife...not wanting to get them dirty...walked onto black ice and broke her leg in 2 places. Now she is only getting her right shoe dirty. The other one is on the shelf.
Adidas,5,These are so beautiful and so light weight. Love!! They shipped so fast. I need to get a matching pair for my husband.
Adidas,5,These are so comfortable and cute! I don’t know if I would say these are “running shoes” but great for around the house and chasing my toddler around.

Adidas,5,These are so comfortable and stylish!
Adidas,5,These are SO comfortable and super cute!
Adidas,5,These are so comfortable and would Definately  buy again! I normally wear a 6 in Nike or new Balance but in these and most Adidas I wear a 5 1/2 so they do run bigger
Adidas,5,These are so comfortable for working out.
Adidas,5,"These are so comfortable I bought another pair in another color... which I never do. They are like walking on air, or running on air. They even have good arch support (I have very high arches).  Best of all they are actually affordable."

Adidas,5,"These are SO comfortable. More for daily activity use than working out due to less support than a running sneaker. They slip on and are literally the most comfortable sneakers I own.
They run slightly small maybe. I’m a 7/7.5 and 7 for perfectly 7.5 would be too big. They are slightly narrow but they seem to stretch a bit after just a few wears so I wouldn’t return if they are just a little on the tighter side.
Love these!"
Adidas,5,These are so comfortable. They really support every part of your feet. Great for every day and for working out. I absolutely love them.
Adidas,5,These are so comfy and also very cute at the same time. Very breathable as well. I have a hard time finding shoes that I can wear all day walking without my feet hurting. I bought these for a family vacation where I walked a lot. My feet never hurt. They are amazing.

Adidas,5,"These are so comfy! Very light, airy!"
Adidas,5,These are so comfy!!! I love that they are so easy to slip on and off! I’ve never even tied or untied them. They can stretch a little so if you have narrow feet you may want to go down a half size. I have medium to wide feet and they stretched out perfectly!!! I got mine on a sale and I’m going to watch out for deals to get a few extra pair! They feel like you’re walking on a cloud!!!
Adidas,5,These are so cute and comfortable!! I haven't work them for working out but love them as everyday tennis shoes!!
Adidas,5,These are so cute and soooo comfy! I normally hate wearing shoes but these feel like nothing on! They do run slightly larger I normally always wear a size 8 I have skinnier feet but the size 8 was a little sloppy so I got a 7.5 and they fit perfect and feel great! Definitely recommend!
Adidas,5,These are so cute and super light! I read other reviewers who said yo go down .5 and I did. Glad I listened! They fit perfectly. I haven’t tried running in them but am on my feet for work a lot and I feel pretty comfortable all day. I wish the other colors were on sale!
Adidas,5,"These are so cute on! I loved them so much I ordered 2 pairs. The first time I got a 7 (the size I normally wear), they were just a little to big for me. The 2nd time I got a 6 1/2 and they fit great. My friend wears a 7 1/2-8 and she tried the 7’s on and they fit her perfect."

Adidas,5,"These are so light...I thought the box was empty when it was delivered!  They are very comfortable, easy to slip on."
Adidas,5,These are so soft and comfortable I bought another pair. They don’t offer a ton of arch support due to the squishy sole so if that’s what you’re looking for get a different shoe. This show has like medium soft support.
Adidas,5,"These are so soft, slip on, and look great with jeans for a casual day. Love!"

Adidas,5,"These are the BEST casual sneakers, and worth every penny. Super flexible and comfortable."
Adidas,5,"These are the best running shoe that I have ever had, which I wasn’t expecting since I didn’t pay the price for a great running shoe. I run about 20 miles a week with max runs at 9 miles, and they have cause me no pains and aches in my feet, shins nor knees."

Adidas,5,"These are the best shoes for walking, running errands, mowing the lawn, going to the dog park, things like that.

They are exactly what I was looking for, I even bought a second pair so they could stay a little cleaner."
Adidas,5,These are the best shoes for your money! So comfortable!
Adidas,5,"These are the best shoes I’ve ever bought in my life. I hadn’t been able to move around a lot because I was recovering from two foot injuries.

Adidas,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought. I work in a hospital and am literally running around all day, plus up and down 11 flights of stairs.  My feet are wide so I was worried they would be too tight - they aren’t!  I wear a 6.5 (wide if I can get it) and these shoes are flexible enough that a 6.5 fit perfectly.  No more pinched toes from heels, ball of my feet blisters from dress shoes or heel friction from flats.  These are unobtrusive enough that I wear these with my professional work clothes and no one bats an eye.

I truly love these shoes!"

Adidas,5,These are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned in my life. I just bought my mom a pair for her birthday and she said the very same thing when she put them on. The best thing about them besides the comfort is that you do not have to tie or untie them. You keep them tied and you can just slip them on. I love these so much I wear them to the exclusion of every other pair of tennis shoes I own. I’ve had mine for going on two years and they have held up fine.
Adidas,5,These are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn. They are so lightweight but also feel very supportive. Perfect for the summer. The color matches almost everything.  I love them!
Adidas,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes I've even owned. This is the 3rd pair I've bought for myself, although they'd be great for a gift too. They fit my feet perfectly and have what feels like memory foam insoles made into them to give me great arch support while I'm walking. I love the almost canvas feel and the mix of colors in the fabric. The shoes are by far my favorite and when I need another pair I will definitely pick these again."

Adidas,5,These are the most comfortable shoes!  I am so happy I purchased them.  I wear a size 9 and these fit perfectly!
Adidas,5,These are the most comfortable shoes. I've worn them on long work days on my feet for 10+ hours and I've worn them to the zoo or an amusement park wandering around all day. They're nice an neutral and very stylish but seriously so comfy. I bought two pair so I'd have the backups when the older ones finally wear out.
Adidas,5,"These are the most comfortable sneakers I have bought! It feels like you're wearing socks and they are extremely breathable. They're a little big but I was too excited to wear them so I didn't return them for what would probably be a half size smaller. They probably aren't great for running but they are perfect for the summer and walking, running errands, and lounging around."

Adidas,5,These are the most light weight shoes I’ve ever owned. They are so comfortable and give my arch a really good support. So worth every penny. I love them so much I’m thinking about ordering the other color
Adidas,5,These are the most lightweight and comfortable sneakers I purchased in a long time. Truly like walking on a cloud. With no tongue they’re Hardee’s to put on but the loop on the back helps. Definitely worth the purchase.
Adidas,5,"These are the perfect casual shoe to wear walking around the city - look great with jeans or athleisure. Very flat sole yet a soft and comfortable base. I also wear them for weight lifting, but these would not provided enough support for cardio."
Adidas,5,These are the perfect lightweight walking shoe!
Adidas,5,"These are the shoes my granddaughter was wanting so much, and I found them here at good price and they  had her size, which was sold out at some places. She loves them. Her mom, my daughter, loves them too, and got herself a pair too. Adidas also good quality shoe."

Adidas,5,"These are very comfortable!!! I feel less tired walking in these than my other shoes. These are the best sneakers I have ever owned. They are so cushioned and comfortable. The only minor issue I found is that they fit a little tight on the top part above the shoe laces, but maybe I just needed to wear them in."
Adidas,5,These are very comfy! Worked great as an option to wear for several days of walking at Disney! Did well at a ranch and cleaned off easy after hiking in the woods too.

Adidas,5,These are very lightweight. Super comfortable. I want one in every color.
Adidas,5,"These are way more comfortable than my Nike Epic React, and much less money.  They are perfect, going to buy more colors!  HIghly recommend, like wearing slippers."
Adidas,5,"These cloud foam adidas are comfortable, and great for working out. My feet are wide normally but the fabric on these shoes is stretchable so they do not fit me tight. Will stick with cloud foam shoes for awhile. Great for the price I paid."
Adidas,5,"These cloud foam shoes are my absolute favorite! I have had 2 foot surgeries, most recently in October, and they offer me so much support. Super cute and stylish, for the fraction of cost of other shoes!"
Adidas,5,"These cloudfoams literally feel like you are walking on clouds.  So soft. Maybe a little more cool than I had expected but ok here in AZ.  I have to wear a lift in my left shoe so the high back and front really helps to keep the shoe in place.  Plus, they look to great!!"
Adidas,5,These feel so nice and I've walked many miles in them. Going to need another pair soon.
Adidas,5,These fit great. The only part that felt odd is there was a different material used on the inner arch so for the first few days it felt snug there.
Adidas,5,These fit perfectly (I'm a 7.5) and I love being able to slip them on and off.  I love the color and they're probably my new favorite! :)

Adidas,5,These have become my most favorite shoe!  Very comfortable!
Adidas,5,"These have gotten harder to find. So comfortable! I have trouble with my feet and ankles but no problem in these shoes. Order your normal size. Adidas is spot on with the sizing. I like how the opening is further up the foot and so offers a little more support, and looks good. I have had several people ask me what brand and where I got them."
Adidas,5,These have zero cushion. Feels like I am walking in socks. Junk!
Adidas,5,These just arrived and they are so lightweight and cute! Supportive as well and fit like a dream! I highly recommend these!

Adidas,5,"These look great, but not a ton of support if you are looking for that."

Adidas,5,"These might be some of the most COMFORTABLE casual tennis shoes I've ever had.... love them!!! Getting a 2nd pair in a dark color. Great with socks and jeans or no socks with capris or shorts. Love the slip-on style.

Note: not a workout shoe and only marginal traction and support, so it's a casual and not a workout shoe. That's what I wanted so they are perfect! I didn't need to overpay on an overkill athletic shoe I won't be athletic in. 🤣👍

Love. Love. LOVE. And reasonable price."
Adidas,5,These might possibly the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Buy them.
Adidas,5,These r the best shoes ever. I walked in them all day. Usually my feet legs and back hurt after a long walking day but I felt great.
Adidas,5,These r the best. I wear them every day at the gym.
Adidas,5,These run a half size larger than other brands. I wear an 8.5 in all other shoes. I ordered an 8.5 in these and they fit like a 9. Definitely size down.
Adidas,5,These run a little big. I would down size by a half size.
Adidas,5,These run a little big. They are so comfortable.
Adidas,5,These run a tad big so I get a half size smaller. Very comfortable to wear any wear except hiking. Not study enough for me to use as a running shoe but very comfortable otherwise.
Adidas,5,These run big but I had previously tried a pair on in Macy’s so I new instead of a 9 which I normally wear i had to buy an 8 1/2. Love the black color with the pink inside
Adidas,5,These running tennis are sooo comfortable. Feel like I'm walking on clouds literally when I wear them. I absolutely love them and ordered other colors.

Adidas,5,"These sneakers run somewhat small, but because of the material of the shoe, they do wear  pretty nicely! It’s extremely flexible, so they’re perfect for taking with me on an audition or if I have a busy day where I’m going to be on my feet non stop!"
Adidas,5,"These super comfy sneakers are so light! They  are great for all day comfort and have just enough support. (When I need high impact support, I go with a pair that have just a little more thick of a sole.) But for a walk or light workout, running errands, sports practice, etc. these are perfect. The color is perfect too!!! Matches everything!"
Adidas,5,These tennis shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned! They fit great and are so light it feels like you are walking on clouds. Amazon got them to me in great time as well!
Adidas,5,"These tennis shoes are very comfortable, light weight, and sleek.  They fit well.  Very satisfied."
Adidas,5,These usually run a little bit big so last time I got a 1/2 size smaller. So I went to order another pair and it was way too small had to replace with 8 1/2.
Adidas,5,These were a gift for my 13 year old. She hate the fit. The back tab of the shoe was too high and rubbed in odd places. Returned these and found something else.
Adidas,5,These were a gift for my daughter and she loves them!
Adidas,5,"These were a gift for my daughter. At first she wasn't sure she liked how they fit, but after going for a run, she decided she like them."
Adidas,5,These were for an angel tree gift. Great price and my daughter also has these shoes and loves them very comfy and run true to size
Adidas,5,These were my first Adidas shoe purchase. I teach classes and these are my favorite shoes! Super comfy and supportive!
Adidas,5,"These were such a great value buy!  I love them - they match with most any outfit.  I don't think I'd use them for any high intensity work outs - but for low impact routines, walking, and running around, they provide sufficient support and are so comfortable."
Adidas,5,"These were the same exact price on the Adidas web site the day I ordered, so I decided to order both to determine whether the reviews stating they may be fakes were true. I can confidently say that these are not knockoffs. Every minor detail, from the box, to the tag, to the shoe itself, is identical. Even the paper inside the box is the same (imprinted with Adidas logo). Shoe construction is the same, the memory foam insert feels the same to the touch and also when tried on. Knockoffs always cut corners somewhere, whether it be the material, construction, or packing materials (box and paper), and there are no corners cut here. The only slight difference I was able to discern was that the ones from Adidas have a slightly harder and more bright white sole, but the Adidas pair is a year newer per the copyright on the bottom of the box, so it makes sense that the company may have updated the sole slightly to make it more durable from last year’s model.

In my pictures, the Adidas pair is on the left and the Amazon pair is on the right.

Sizing: I am a solid 8.5 with a more narrow foot. Because I have read that Adidas run large, I bought these in an 8. They are not long enough, and they are also not nearly as wide as my Adidas PureBoost sneakers. They are a more narrow cut and fit true to size. Unfortunately, Amazon is currently sold out of 8.5, so I had to return these. I could tell by trying them on that they are VERY comfy, so I will be buying my correct size in the future!"
Adidas,5,They are awesome!!! Would definitely buy again!!
Adidas,5,They are comfortable
Adidas,5,"They are comfortable.... I'm not a runner but I knew a ""running shoe"" would be good for my walking :)"
Adidas,5,They are comfy not as much support as I expected but I sometimes have pain in my right leg so that could be why. Get them if your looking for trainers you don't have to tie and untie!
Adidas,5,They are exactly what I was expecting very light weight packaging just like if you were to go to foot locker I saw a lot of bad reviews on these so I was very nervous and hesitant and looking for something wrong but I can tell you when I got them compared to the Adidas website and to Footlocker and I have a men’s pair and they are authentic and exactly what I was expecting.
Adidas,5,"They are extremely comfortable, I use them mainly for standing and walking but I have the best comfort ever."
Adidas,5,"They are great casual cute shoes. They are a tad narrow for me in my toebox, but if you have narrower feet, its probably perfect. And they are soft material so it stretches."
Adidas,5,"They are light, comfortable, cute!!!  Love the them, would love to have a pair in alllll colors!"
Adidas,5,They are lightweight and comfy. A little tight but they are new so I need to wear them in. I can't wear thick socks in these.
Adidas,5,"They are lightweight and not ideal for most workout enthusiasts, but I still go on walks and runs with them daily. The laces need to be tied, but the structure of the shoe doesn’t allow for “tightening” the shoe with the laces. They fit loose, but don’t fall off my feet while running. Great shoe if your looking for a low price."
Adidas,5,They are my new favorite shoe!! I ended up buying a pair for my son and partner!
Adidas,5,They are my new favorite shoe. So lite and cozy.
Adidas,5,They are nice. Not enough padding for me though. They run large. I kept them too long to return. Darn it. Have to wear them with a heavier sock
Adidas,5,They are so comfortable
Adidas,5,They are so comfortable and great for walking/running.
Adidas,5,They are so comfortable and look great. Many shoes hurt a certain toe but these are roomy in the toe
Adidas,5,They are so comfortable and pretty! Exactly as pictured. Always my to go shoes whenever I know I’ll be walking long distances. Great quality so far
Adidas,5,They are so comfortable.
Adidas,5,They are so comfortable. Supportive too.
Adidas,5,They are so cute and comfy!! I coach volleyball and they are super comfy while I am on my feet for 12 hours!
Adidas,5,"They are so cute and so comfortable. Not sure I would wear them to work out in, but for just running around they are great."
Adidas,5,"They are so light, and comfortable. I just ordered another pair in a different color!"
Adidas,5,They are sooo incredibly comfortable especially since I am on my feet over 12 hours a day. Plus they make my cankles Look like legit ankles and what more good this thick bitch ask for!!! I even bought a back up pair cause you never know when the greates shoes in your life good be gone. Plus they work like shape ups but with out the stupid moon shoes look. No one wants to have bitchin sneakers to wear and then have to settle with those sneakers looking like orthopedic rejects your blind grandmother wouldn’t even wear. You know cause she can sense the catastrophe.
Adidas,5,"They are stylish & very cushioned. I bought them to wear for long days at work (Nurse). There was no break in period & I wore them for a 14 hour workday the first time I put them on.
I ordered a half size up (6.5) as my experience with Adidas is they run small. A 6 would have fit perfectly."
Adidas,5,"They are super comfortable, don't easily slip-and really cute. Since they are mesh, don't expect a huge support. Let's see how long they last..."
Adidas,5,They are super comfy and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on them.
Adidas,5,They are SUPER COMFY! I bought them especially because I was going to NY and I am 6 months pregnant. I knew I was going to walk a lot abd needed some comfy shoes and I loved these! My feet never hurt and did not swell at all. I definitely recommend these shoes for full comfort.
Adidas,5,They are very comfortable and I received a lot of complements
Adidas,5,"They are very comfortable,  I am a nurse and am on my feet 14 hours at a time,  so comfy!"
Adidas,5,"They are very comfortable, but they are big maybe half a size smaller would of been great."
Adidas,5,They are very comfortable. I think they would be perfect for working out but I haven't tried that yet. I think that if you like them you should buy them no doubt.
Adidas,5,"They are very comfortable. I work in a hospital, so I walk at least 5 miles a day, my feet don’t hurt by the end of the day. The fabric on the outside has almost like a neoprene feel. They are true to size. I would definitely recommend."
Adidas,5,They are very comfortable... and they fit perfect. One of the best shoes I have gad
Adidas,5,They are very comfy.
Adidas,5,They feel great!
Adidas,5,"They feel so good on my feet.
Gonna buy another pair."
Adidas,5,They feel weird at first but i got used to it. I get a lot of compliments.
Adidas,5,They fit awesome
Adidas,5,They fit great and are very comfortable.
Adidas,5,They fit great. I'm usually a 8 so I bought my size. When I tried them on it felt like a half size bigger. I was like ugh..but after using them yesterday to workout with the extra room worked out perfect. The shoes are lightweight and really comfy. It's like you're walking on air. Definitely a good buy..
Adidas,5,They fit like a glove!  Very light and so comfy!  Would definitely recommend for casual wear!  Not a running or walking shoe.  Very stylish too :).
Adidas,5,They fit perfect and are super cute and comfy!! Breathable but provide excellent support!
Adidas,5,They fit perfect. I’m a size 10 and they look super cute one my feet. They make my feet look smaller. I have worn walking many many miles.
Adidas,5,"They fit perfectly! I love them so much! I'm usually on my feet for 14 hours a day due to being a nurse and with the virus I've been needed on a very high demand!
 They make work so much better and my feet don't hurt as bad as they used to before purchasing 😁"
Adidas,5,"They fit perfectly, lightweight; good amount of support, however probably not enough for running for me.  Perfect for light to moderate exercise and walking around all day.  I love the way these look."
Adidas,5,They fit well. I am wondering when shoes stopped having a tongue. This has a solid piece across the front.
Adidas,5,They got perfectly
Adidas,5,"They hurt where the seam is on the side. I'll give them another few times wearing them. I like how light weight they are and how soft the sole is.
It's been another week and they still hurt. I contacted the company and they will not let me return them. I won't ever do business with them again."
Adidas,5,"They look great and they’re super comfortable. Used them on a trip to Japan. Easy to take off and put back on, my feet felt okay through a really long trip and lots of layovers."
Adidas,5,They look great with anything and are very comfortable.
Adidas,5,"They look great, thinking of ordering a 2nd pair! She's already gotten compliments from friends!"
Adidas,5,"They may be counterfeit for a reason or 2. I wont be harsh because they fit great.

The price sketched me out, but Women's running adidas are cheaper than men's so probably nothing to worry about.

Yeah thats right, I said screw these Mens online prices and did the size conversion of 1.5 higher size & am happy. I don't care, if these said mens I would have bought them so I did regardless.

Keep in mind if you are a man. Only buy if you have narrow feet, especially at the heels. Chick Shaped Feet Paying Dividends!!

Yeaaah."
Adidas,5,"They run a bit big like most adidas, but I loooove these sneakers. I wear them at work where I'm on my feet quite a bit and to exercise and they are very comfortable! I love that the tongue is built right in to the shoe and they are still very easy to get on"
Adidas,5,"They run a bit large and have zero arch support, which, in this case, is fin because I can use my orthotics with them. Great casual shoes."
Adidas,5,They run a hair big but you can't go down a half size or they won't fit.  They are VERY comfortable and lightweight.
Adidas,5,They run a little big I usually wear size 8 in athletic shoes so 7.5 would have fit better.
Adidas,5,They run a little big. I could of went down a size and still of been comfortable. I like them a little roomy so that didn’t bother me. Over all I’m happy.
Adidas,5,"They run a smidgen too big. I wish they had a size in-between 5.5 and 6. But other than that, very good shoes. Super comfortable and light."
Adidas,5,They run alittle big I wear a 7 could fit in a 6.5 thick socks fit great with 7 size they are light weight and memory foam love them
Adidas,5,"They weigh about as much as a sheet of paper each, my daughter lives them!"
Adidas,5,They went on my feet and instantly went for a 5 mile walk.  No blisters no issues.  Super cute.  Love them.
Adidas,5,"They were a good price, they are VERY comfortable and so cute!!!"
Adidas,5,They were for my mom and she loves them. Has them on all the time.
Adidas,5,"They were slightly big on me, I ordered a 9 and I probably could have done an 8.5 but I wear a thicker sock and the feel great. They support my feet super well and with someone with a lot of joint problems they really help with my lower back as well. I will never buy a different pair of tennis shoes!"
Adidas,5,They were very comfortable. Used them for working!
Adidas,5,"They were very light weight, which was great for running. The cushions were also very comfortable, I didn't even really feel the need to break them in."
Adidas,5,"They’re okay, I bought for myself and daughter. They were about a half size too big, not sure if it’s the material?"
Adidas,5,"They’re real. Came in an adidas box. I love them, I keep the laces tucked in cuz I just wear them for running errands, not actual running. They’re slim and make my feet look small which is what I wanted. Very comfy."
Adidas,5,"They're amazing, my wife loves them."
Adidas,5,"They're not great for running/gym time, but for everyday ""walkers"" these can't be beat. Super light weight and look cute with everything."
Adidas,5,They're very comfortable
Adidas,5,This a great shoe for every day errands or working out either walk or jog around the block and  great ease of a slip on !
Adidas,5,"This are great shoes. I did not have any previous experience wearing them before this order. The memory foam is awesome, the shoe fits great and looks great with my Adidas track suit I was gifted with at Christmas!"
Adidas,5,This color fit slightly bigger than my Grey ones. But obsessed w these shoes. So comfortable
Adidas,5,"This color is exactly like the picture. It's a pretty medium pastel lilac all around and if you're like me and have all the cloudfoam pure's, this is darker than the lavender with white bottoms. I LOVE IT. exactly what I wanted although a bit pricey from all my other cloudfoams. I actually have never seen this color in store or on the adidas website or anywhere else, so I'm happy! I will keep checking back for new, unique colors like this one!"
Adidas,5,"this is a cute shoe for running around. it doesn't offer support for ""working out"" or walking the neighborhood. I wear it as an everyday shoe. the memory foam is nice on your soles. it slides on and off easily.  it is durable."
Adidas,5,This is a go to shoe for whatever your activity is.  It has a good fit and comfortable and easy to clean in washer.
Adidas,5,"This is a great looking sneaker, very comfortable, great workout shoe."
Adidas,5,"This is a great mirror. I'd like to say I've had three different (slightly cheaper and from a different seller) mirrors like this in the last two years... all the other ones broke. Here's why I think this one is better. It's slightly heavier (in a more solid way).  also the PLUG is in a MUCH BETTER SPOT, other mirrors the usb (or whatever kinda plug it is in directly under the mirror causing it to pull and eventually break. This mirrors plug is in the back so the cord doesn't have to bend. Also it has a switch on the back to turn it on, not the little touch button on the mirror itself. Those always broke on my previous mirrors. Also it has 3 different light options so that's cool too. I'm a fan."
Adidas,5,This is a great pair of shoes. I walked in this morning and they fit great definitely will get another pair
Adidas,5,"This is a nice inexpensive cross trainer for light workouts. I work out at home and wanted a pair of xtrainers that I could wear in the house and not scuff up the floor. These are great for that. I wouldn’t wear them on a long run or anything requiring more ankle or sole stability. You cant really tighten the laces at the ankle as well as you can with other shoes. This is not as good as a $100 or $150 shoe but I knew that going in, so I am satisfied. They are cute too!"
Adidas,5,This is a really cute and comfortable shoe for everyday use. It is lightweight and does not offer much foot support so I would not recommend for running
Adidas,5,this is a very comfortable and great looking shoe
Adidas,5,This is a very comfortable lightweight shoe. Love this shoe!!!
Adidas,5,This is a very comfortable shoe that fit me perfectly! They are amazing and I will buy more!
Adidas,5,"This is by far my favorite tennis shoe ever!!! its so comfy! I have this color, the all black and blue! This is also my 2nd time buying the gray and white one since i wore my others constantly and they needed to be replaced from all the wear and tear i did to them! They look cute with anything! I'm obsessed!"
Adidas,5,"This is literally my favorite shoe. Slips on and off so don’t even have to adjust laces, and is SO comfortable. Never owned “cloud foam” before but it’s also breathable. I really like a lot. And I am wearing them in 100+ degree weather sometimes too."
Adidas,5,This is my 2nd pair. Same color too! I love these sneakers. Almost feel bare footed because they are so light weight.
Adidas,5,"This is my 3rd time buying these shoes, they are AMAZING!"
Adidas,5,This is my absolute favorite sneaker
Adidas,5,"This is my fifth pair to buy from Adidas!  They are so comfortable for all day walking, and I have never gotten a blister, even when they were new.  They are lightweight and have the memory foam on the inside.  Most comfortable athletic shoes I have ever own, that's why I bought them in all different colors!"
Adidas,5,"This is my first pair of Adidas and I am in love!!! There fit perfectly and are so comfortable and cute, I think these are very worth the money!! And I also got them super fast via Amazon Prime so I'm a happy camper"
Adidas,5,This is my second pair (wanted another color) they are extremely light and comfortable. They passed the test of my nieces who are in their 20’s for style as well.
Adidas,5,This is my second pair and for the money you can’t beat them! They fit true to size and work well for me at a job that I’m on my feet 8-9 hours a day.
Adidas,5,This is my second pair and I 100% recommend and would order again in every color!
Adidas,5,This is my second pair like this is. I loved it so much I wanted another pair.
Adidas,5,"This is my second pair now, I just Love them. They are super comfortable. I'm a 9 in these with a good sock, but a 9.5/10 in boots. They slip right on and are very stylish. I wear them with my leggings to run errands."
Adidas,5,This is my second pair of Adidas Cloudfoam Pure. I love them. They fit so well and are so light and comfortable.
Adidas,5,"This is my second pair of Adidas Cloudform shoes. I now have the beige and black/white colors and I love them! They are so cute and they’re my favorite, most comfortable sneakers. Love how easy they are to put on and off because they slide on."
Adidas,5,"This is my second pair of cloudfoam adidas I've purchased and I LOVE THEM. So comfortable, so light and just overall really great shoes. I was also a Nike girl until I found this style and I don't think I'll ever go back."
Adidas,5,This is my second pair of the same shoe (after wearing out the first pair)!  They are ridiculously comfortable and literally the shoe I choose over all my other athletic shoes.  I have a high arch and the support in this shoe is very accommodating.
Adidas,5,This is my second pair of these and I love them.
Adidas,5,"This is my second pair of these cloudfoam shoe and they are, by far, my favorite active shoes! They are light enough for running, but stable enough for weights/HIIT/cross-training."
Adidas,5,This is my second pair of these shoes! I have the lighter grey/white ones too. I work in the medical field & they are very comfortable to wear for 8plus hours at a time.
Adidas,5,This is my second pair of these. I've found them to be a great casual shoe for a nice walk on a path or around town. I really purchased them as an easy slip on to go to my barre class. They look super cute with my leggings for errands after class.
Adidas,5,This is my second pair.  They are real comfortable and also washable.
Adidas,5,"This is my second pair. The first pair I bought last year (pre-pandemic) to wear to Disneyland for the first time and run around there for 18+ hour days for 4 days in a row and these shoes were a lifesaver!

Being light in color they do show dirt sooner than later obviously but still love them!"
Adidas,5,This is my second purchase of this sneaker. I hope it’s never discontinued!!
Adidas,5,This is my second time purchasing this exact shoe after one year. I work in a rehab at a nursing home and im constantly on my feet. Since im on the heavier side I often don't find sneakers with good arch support but these are so comfortable.
Adidas,5,"This is my third pair of Adidas Cloudfoam shoe. I love these and they’re so comfy for my working hours. They are real, and not fake. I love them. I would buy more!"
Adidas,5,"This is my third pair of these shoes. They are my favorite for comfort. I get blisters easily, but these seem to be better than most. I size up for my running shoes. My only complaint is that they wear out fast. The soles are pretty thin which makes them light, but I tear through shoes pretty quickly as is and these I go through even faster. I started adding Engo patches to the ball of them and that seems to keep me from wearing through them so fast."
Adidas,5,This is my third pair.  They’re very comfortable!  I use them for walking & just doing errands.  They’re my go to sneaker.  I definitely recommend.
Adidas,5,This is not a working out shoe but an outfit shoes. Just as described
Adidas,5,"This is one of my favorite products I’ve ever purchased on Amazon. I needed comfortable shoes I could slip on quickly to walk to work or the store. I got them over a year ago, and they have held up very well - just some wear on the soles. Living in the city, shoes never last that long. They are a bit let structured than my running shoes, but I can still run and work out in them without them slipping or coming off. And they really don’t look like slip-ons. I’m so pleased with them."
Adidas,5,"This is one of the most comfortable tennis shoe that I’ve ever put on my foot!  I wear it for walking, bike riding & just around!"
Adidas,5,"This is perfect for running, walking, hanging out. They are so comfortable and so fun! Super stylish color and the amazing quality you would expect from Adidas!"
Adidas,5,"This is such a ""bouncy"" light weight shoe!!! I LOVE it so much!!! Adidas, you did it again! fit perfect!!!!!"
Adidas,5,This is such a cute and comfortable sneaker! I love that it is a slip on too.
Adidas,5,"This is the best athletic slip-on I've ever owned.  I just ordered my third pair as they're so comfortable that I tend to wear them everywhere.  Lightweight, breathable, and they fit like a glove.  (they look great too)  They are amazingly durable for the price and minimalist feel, and there is no breaking in period - they are comfortable from day one.  I've always opted for the dark ones, decided to change it up this time, really happy I did!

The only downside I can think of is that they're low profile and the default ""insert"" is in fact part of the shoe - so if you need to wear your own insert, it will likely not fit comfortably in this shoe.  Not a problem for me as I find they provide plenty of support, but should be noted."
Adidas,5,"This is the BEST shoe ever.  Feel like a sock, so soft and hugs the feet.  I don't use to run, just daily casual wear. I will buy these again for sure."
Adidas,5,This is the best shoe I have ever had.  I highly recommend them.  They are so lite  and comfortable and they don’t make your feet hot.  When I picked up package I thought someone stole my shoes.  Lol.  That’s how lite they are.
Adidas,5,"This is the first pair of adidas I have ever bought or wore. I saw them on amazon by scrolling and liked the look of them and thought I’d try them. I am so glad I did! They are so comfortable, lightweight and stylish! Very satisfied and got at a great price!"
Adidas,5,This is the lightest shoe I've ever owned. It's extremely comfortable and easy to wear all day long. Not sure this would be an ideal running shoe since there isn't a ton of cushion. These sneakers are sleek and stylish enough to wear with jeans and a t-shirt.
Adidas,5,"This is THE most comfortable shoe I have ever worn, plus I love the look. The tongue being continuous with the shoe itself plus the flexible fabric just make it so comfortable. Great gym shoe or everyday wear sneaker. I am in love with this shoe and I will be buying more."
Adidas,5,"This is the most comfortable shoe I’ve ever worn. I have issues with my ankles and arch support. These provide lots of support without being so bulky. They are very light weight. I walked my daughter to school and back home this morning (1.5 miles) and there was no rubbing or anything that made them uncomfortable. Cute shoe too! I’m normally an 8.5, but per the reviews, I ordered an 8 and it fits perfect. Getting these in other colors. I just hope they don’t fall apart in the first couple of months!"
Adidas,5,This is the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned!!! I love it so so so much!!
Adidas,5,This is the most comfortable sneaker I own to date. My feet feel like they're in heaven. I've had expensive sneakers and extremely inexpensive sneakers and these are by far the ones that hurt my feet the least. The ones I wore the most before these were some Time and Tru slip ons from Walmart. I'm definitely happy with this purchase. They run true to size. I wish they had more color options.
Adidas,5,"This is THE MOST comfortable tennis shoe I have ever had. I've never liked wearing tennis shoes because they felt hot and tight and heavy....until now.  These are so light weight and comfortable that I can wear them all day.  My feet, knees and back don't hurt as much either.  I'm going to buy another pair to have as a back up pair!"
Adidas,5,This is the second pair I have bought and they are great and so comfortable
Adidas,5,"This is the second pair I have purchased because they are the absolute most comfortable shoes I have ever worn! I may buy another pair to put in my closet when this new pair is worn out.  Easy to slide on, no need to tie everytime. Super comfy insole- feels like I am walking on air.  They are very ventilated with the airy fabric. The only downside is that during the winter months, they don't keep your feet very warm... but thicker socks help with that. 😉 Highly recommended!"
Adidas,5,"This is the second pair of Addidas shoes I have purchased for power walking.  They are simply awesome!  They are so light weight, really supportive, and so comfortable!  Truly a great value for the money!"
Adidas,5,This is the second pair of these exact sneakers that I have purchased and I love them. I wore the first pair done to the bitter end and needed a pair to travel abroad. These are comfortable and light weight and don’t take up room in your luggage.
Adidas,5,This item was specifically requested for gifting. Really good price point
Adidas,5,"This my 2nd pair, I missed the return window for my first pair. I’m usually a 9/9.5 and ordered a 9 my first time. They were pretty big so I decided to order the 8.5 this time and they’re perfect. Highly suggest sizing down!!"
Adidas,5,"This not only look great and match everything, they are so very comfy!"
Adidas,5,"This product is expensive and my expectation is to be quality , warrantied , customer support"
Adidas,5,This product is great the sneaker is so comfortable I have an issue with  my feet swelling up and it’s Still comfortable they have some stretch
Adidas,5,"This review is for the look and feel of the shows. I’m in love with these shoes! They came today and I should have sized up. I usually wear and 8, but sometimes I get running shoes a half size bigger. I have a pair of classic Addidas and I wear an 8 in those, so I thought an 8 would be good. I’m returning the size 8 and getting an 81/2. I can’t wait to wear these! I’ll update hr review for comfort once I wear them for a while I plan to wear them for my upcoming Disneyland trip next week!"
Adidas,5,This seller is awesome! These shoes were advertised as used but there’s no way! They don’t have a spec on them. I’m VERY happy with this purchase.
Adidas,5,"This shoe (I'm an Adidas fan anyhow) is quite comfortable.  I wanted a light weight, easy slip on style show for when I go to the gym and go walking - it's a great fit, cute style and I'm very happy with the quality.  Accurate sizing - really cute shoe."
Adidas,5,"This shoe brand is in first place with Vans for my favorite to buy. As always, the shoes are amazing."
Adidas,5,This shoe fit me true to size. Light and comfy.
Adidas,5,This shoe fits good and is comfortable.  It has enough support for walking but I would recommend something a little more supportive for daily running.
Adidas,5,This shoe fits very well. I have a narrow foot and sometimes my foot swims in other running shoes. This one really gives the support I need. Highly recommend for narrow foot women.
Adidas,5,"This shoe is a dream. It is comfortable without being heavy. The extended back avoids the friction on the back of your foot. Thus you ca wear any sock. Yes, they are practically al but they are also so cute with a casual outfit."
Adidas,5,"This shoe is a little narrow, I wouldn’t recommend if you have wide feet. But other than that it’s great for running or getting a good workout on my cardio day ✊🏻
Feels super light"
Adidas,5,"This shoe is awesome. It fits like a glove, it lightweight and looks great! If you go between 2 different shoe sizes, get the bigger size."
Adidas,5,"This shoe is perfect for everyday errands, house chores, and walking. I would not exercise (run, walk, etc) with these shoes. I would desire a shoe designed with competitive exercise in mind."
Adidas,5,this shoe is so comfortable with a lot of support
Adidas,5,This shoe is the best shoe i have had in a long time!
Adidas,5,This shoe is the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned. It's like I'm not even wearing shoes. Love love love! And the price was very reasonable.
Adidas,5,"This shoe is very comfortable, I’m not a runner, just got it for everyday use and going to the gym.  They don’t have a lot of support but kind of hug your feet and that makes them comfortable. I wear a size 9 and the 9 fits fine."
Adidas,5,"This shoe looks great on. I knotted the end of the laces and cut the remainder off, as the tongue of the shoe is sewn and stretches as you walk. The laces are for decoration really. I would not use these as a workout shoe, but they are great for walking around town. Everybody stops me and ask where I got them."
Adidas,5,"This shoes are cute and comfy, I've got them in a 9, because of wearing with footies but without footies a little big. But that does not stop me for loving them."
Adidas,5,This sneaker fit true to size and is super comfy. Love to have them on. I could walk all day in them.
Adidas,5,This sneaker help me in my work.  I do a lot standing and these sneakers help my knees.  I needed a sneaker that was lightweight.  Great sneakers.
Adidas,5,This sneaker is attractive. Looks good with both athletic wear and jeans. The best feature is their comfort.. it’s like walking on air.
Adidas,5,"This sneaker is lightweight but oh so comfortable. I can wear them all day. They have great support, are lightweight, and look very cute."
Adidas,5,This sneaker is so comfortable and stylish!
Adidas,5,this sneakers fit perfect . they are so light weight so when I receive them I was so confuse till I do not open the box. I was thinking they put only one shoe in my box. I love them great for long walk . They are the sox type and that make them great for any type of exercising
Adidas,5,"This tennis shoe is exactly what I was looking for, the fit was as expected, and they are very comfortable. They are super cute too!"
Adidas,5,This the second pair of these I’ve had and they were great. Love them.
Adidas,5,"This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. She loved them! They are very stylish and she says, comfortable to wear. They are true to size as they fit her perfectly. Good product, I would recommend."
Adidas,5,This was a gift for my wife and she loves them.
Adidas,5,This was a gift so I don't know how it fit.  It looked like the picture on Amazon.
Adidas,5,This was a gift to my sister who is a nurse and is always on her feet and she described the comfort as literally walking on clouds. I definitely will be getting some for myself!
Adidas,5,"Three times a charm! I'm so happy! Only got these today, but, after send 2 pairs back...yay! I'm very wide, size 10. I was encouraged to jump up to an 11; those were really huge. These fit perfect. I have a very high arch and these are soft, and comfortable, though, no tounge. It looks like there is, but the whole upper shoes is essentially a loafer. That said, the laces work to cinch the shoe tighter if need be. With my arch there's a bit of a fight to get them on, but not bad. Super light weight. The blue looks more denim than comes off in the pictures. I'm going for a walk!"
Adidas,5,too small
Adidas,5,"Too tight across the instep. Guess I am stuck with them because they want me to pay a shipping fee to return them.
Won’t buy from this seller again"
Adidas,5,"Totally in love with my new adidas sneakers! Not only are they fashionable but they're the most comfortable shoe I've had in a while. Through walks, workouts, shopping, you name it. Can't go wrong."
Adidas,5,True to size
Adidas,5,True to size & very comfortable. I would definitely recommend!
Adidas,5,True to size and lightweight
Adidas,5,True to size and looks good on me 🙂
Adidas,5,"True to size
I love these"
Adidas,5,"True to size!! I saw a few reviews saying this shoe is narrow but I have really flat and fairly wide feet it fits me perfectly fine. I usually wear an 8, ordered an 8 and fits great. I bought these for casual wear not for working out so I can’t comment on how they are for running shoes or weight room shoes"
Adidas,5,"True to size, very comfortable"
Adidas,5,"True to size, very comfy and easy to put on."
Adidas,5,True to size.  Light weight and are the most comfortable tennis shoes I've had in a long time.  Good purchase.
Adidas,5,"True to size. If you want to work out or run in these shoes plan on buying support inserts, these shoes have no support. They are pretty quality material"
Adidas,5,True to size. These are so light and so comfortable! I am going to buy another pair.
Adidas,5,"Update - I am now on my 6th pair of these shoes. They are so easy with the pull on style, and so comfy. They still run a little big, so size down 1/2 size. Great deal for how awesome of a shoe they are!
These are the cutest and comfiest shoes! I am usually a size 8, and I have a few other pair of Adidas CF running shoes in size 8 that are a little too big. So when I bought these I got a 7 1/2, and they fit perfect! The color is super cute, and they are so light - perfect for running. Love them - I will probably buy every color."
Adidas,5,"Update: I still love my cloud foams. However due to my increasingly demanding clinical site work, I’ve upgraded my shoes to the Adidas Ultraboost 19. My school requires white shoes (I’ve been able to get away with the pale blue Cloud foams because like Shawshank Redemption, people tend to not look at other’s shoes). The Ultraboost are considerably more at about $180 MSRP. But they come with a ton more springiness and you can tell you are getting much more in a shoe. They are very forgiving to feet that swell over a long day so I recommend to try those if you’re in the market for something nicer.

Side note: I hear Nike is coming out with a shoe line specifically geared towards healthcare workers and shift work. Excited to give those a shot down the line but for now I am happy wearing both my cloud foams and ultraboosts

Sizing.. not sure how my feet shrank over the last 20 years but they have gone down from. 7.5-8 to a 5.5. Pretty soon i’ll be wearing baby shoes. In these particular shoes for my feet (knowing it varies for people) I’d say they’re a good fit maybe slightly roomy which works well since I wear thick compression socks since I am in nursing school. The 10-12 hours in the hospital make it so my feet swell. So I would recommend getting your normal size.

I have these shoes in both grey and pale blue. Although I agree “cloud foam” makes it sound like you’re stepping onto a memory foam mattress and it enveloping and caressing your tired feet.. it has much less padding than anticipated. However, these are THE most comfortable shoes I have owned in quite some time.

I have several pairs of Nike Free which are also comfy in their own right but I am finding my feet are getting slightly wider as I age (yay) I am in my 30’s if that helps any reader.

The huge plus in these are that the raised and padded heel makes it so I never ever get blisters there. And i always get blisters there.

The only thing i’m not crazy about is the tongue portion. The top of it hits the same area of my foot so I can’t sport ankle socks. It’s ok for me since I am always wearing them in scrubs under long pants.

I’ve worn my grey pair on 4 hour hikes, 8 hours in an amusement park and every time these do not make me feel like I have bound feet.

The price for a big name brand is really reasonable at $55. I typically expect to spen $100+"

Adidas,5,Using these for my workout days
Adidas,5,"Usually I wear a size 5.5 (sometimes a size 6). After reading some of the reviews, I went with a size 5 and they fit perfectly, so go down a size. They are very light, look great on, and are comfortable for walking around in...not running shoes as the name would suggest. The sole has some cushion, but it is not supportive enough for running. I bought these since they are cute and casual. Very happy with the purchase!"
Adidas,5,"Usualmente compro talla 9 pero esta vez en este calzado me quedo un poco grande....
cómodos, ligeros, ideales para hacer ejercicio..."

I’ve gotten several compliments on them already, and I love their sleek and clean look. They seem to run about a half-size big.

Adidas,5,"Very nice looking sneakers. I wouldn’t go running in these but for casual wear they look really nice.  I usually wear a 6 or 6 1/2, depending on the sneaker. I ordered a 6 and the fit well. If you’re looking for a running sneaker, I don’t think these have a thick enough sole."

Adidas,5,Very nice shoe- Lightweight & comfortable
Adidas,5,"Very nice shoes, I got two pairs"

Adidas,5,Very nice. Fit perfect. And cheaper than famous footwear and footlocker

Also the first day I wore these shoes I didnt have to wear them in, they were so comfortable for all day wear!"
Adidas,5,Very pleased with this purchase. They are comfortable and stylish and have been perfect for the long walks I have been taking daily.
Adidas,5,Very rarely am I able to put on a new pair of shoes without applying bandaids and heel guards. These shoes are the exception. They were amazingly comfortable and provided good support the first time I put them on. I didn’t want to take them off after my two mile walk. They are a perfect fit and very attractive. I’m so happy with this purchase.
Adidas,5,Very soft and comfy
Adidas,5,Very soft and lightweight
Adidas,5,Very soft and lightweight! Use it for walking

Adidas,5,Very stylish...I have gotten many compliments wearing these shoes. They look the same is the pictures. Very light weight and comfortable.
Adidas,5,Very upset shoes have been on someone's feet!! Foot print inside and strings dirty!!!
Adidas,5,Vet comfy shoes not for running but very comfortable.
Adidas,5,"Visually these are gorgeous and go with all my outfits. I wore mine all day and when I took them off my feet were very happy!. I’m not sure about the back but I felt like I had to be a contortionist to get them on. Could be that they are just new and not broken in.  I’m still amazed by the weight. Super light!!!! I would say they have a ton of comfort but they are comfortable. The toe box is sufficient so you don’t have squished toes.
Sizing: I normally wear a 7.5 us. I had to get a 6.5 and I think I could have worn a 6. But my daughter who wears 8.5 bought 8.5 and they are perfect."
Adidas,5,Walking on air
Adidas,5,Want to buy another colors too!
Adidas,5,Wanted a pair of shoes that had white and at first only purchased due to sale. Ended up buying a second pair as backup. Also have washed them through the washer and still hold up as if brand new.
Adidas,5,Was a gift for our grandaughter. She loved them and they fit perfect.
Adidas,5,"Was a little skeptical on these shoes - boy was I wrong.  Super comfy, easy to wear and CUTE CUTE!  I wouldn't work out in them (cardio), but perfect for everything else.  I have plantar faciaitis and this shoe does NOT seem to bother it.  Now, it doesn't have the full support that I would need, but that's on me not the shoe.  Am ordering these in different colors."
Adidas,5,Was disappointed that these lace up though. The pictures make it look like they don’t tie up. While they technically just slip on you still have to tie the and the laces are really long. Too long. I kept the shoes... they are comfortable and I wanted something that slips on. Just a little disappointed about the laces.
Adidas,5,"Was very pleased, love the style, the comfort, I would buy them again"
Adidas,5,"We don't have to much to say, we love them."
Adidas,5,Well priced very comfortable shoe right off the bat - I was having some ankle issues I'm guessing from little support - these shoes helped so much!
Adidas,5,Well worth price and I have a wide foot and feels amazing
Adidas,5,What a great summer sneaker!! True to size and light weight for a hot summer day!!
Adidas,5,What you see is what you get...they are nice shoes
Adidas,5,"When I first got these I thought they were too narrow (I do have wide feet but like they felt weird) AT FIRST! But then after wearing them a few times, it didn't feel narrow anymore! Broke it in and they are sooo comfortable! I work at a retail store so I'm on my feet constantly and these shoes keep me going all day! I have no problems with my feet or back and I don't need insoles! great shoes and buying another pair!"
Adidas,5,"While I liked the design of the shoe, the comfort level for me depends on the support. Unfortunately there was not enough support for me."
Adidas,5,"Wife is happy, happy wife means I get happy gifts from her ;)"
Adidas,5,Wife liked it.
Adidas,5,Wife likes them

Adidas,5,Wife loves this shoe.  Wants to buy another one.  She says it’s very comfortable even wearing it all day.
Adidas,5,Wife picked them out for Christmas. She said best athletic shoes she has ever worn. Uses them for CrossFit 3x per week
Adidas,5,"Wife works on her feet (Bartender) 8+ hours a day. Her feet have been hurting her, so I got these for her birthday. She loves them and has worn them everyday to work! Happy Wife=Happy Life!"
Adidas,5,"With 12 hour shifts at the hospital, these hold up so much better than my nursing clogs! Love these shoes👍"

Adidas,5,Wore them for traveling and walking.  Very comfortable and cute.
Adidas,5,"Wore this shoe for a tour of Italy. Very comfortable and held up great. I'm usually a 6 with a little wider forefoot. Sized up to 6.5 and fit great. I did wear them hiking one day on a rocky path, they were fine, but I did feel every rock I stepped on due to having a soft sole. Still love them"
Adidas,5,"Work as a custodian. Walk seven miles minimum a day. I’m 5’7 and overweight (210). My feet only Mildly hurt, which is a feat (sorry for the pun)."
Adidas,5,Worn the shoes for cross fit training and love them so far! Very comfortable
Adidas,5,Would get a 1/2 size larger
Adidas,5,"Wow- I have ordered and sadly returned SO many pairs of sneakers 👟 since I have weird feet 🦶 and thankfully these are not only sleek and beautiful but comfortable!! Lots of support, amazing price. Perfect fit!"
Adidas,5,Wow! I saw some ladies say that these shoes were the most comfortable athletic shoe online and they weren't kidding. I got them at a great price and delivered in one day. I haven't ever had a pair of addidas but I will be a long time customer now and will be recommending these shoes to everyone.
Adidas,5,Wow! I've always loved Adidas but never expected these to be such a lightweight shoe! Perfect for summer. I can't get over how comfortable these are!
Adidas,5,"Wow! These shoes are so light! They are cute, comfortable, and provide excellent support. So happy I bought them. I want more!"
Adidas,5,Wow!! These are so freaking comfortable!!!! So cute too!! I'm a huge runner and I needed a new pair of shoes and I chose these!
Adidas,5,"Yes, yes, yes! Cloud foam support! Working 12 hours shifts. It’s a must have. Running 3 miles a day. Got me 3 pairs in different colors. An awesome fit."
Adidas,5,"You know the worse part of shoes... laces. Best part of these shoes is that I dont need to untie the laces EVER. They are secret slip ons!! The laces can be tightened the shoe if you're nervous of the shoe bandits, but they stay snug on my feet without any tightening at all. Gone are the days of panic tying my shoe laces because I mismanaged my time before work. (Also gone is the time before work since I got laid off. Anyways, for the price of these shoes, you really can't go wrong. There isnt an excess of cushion in them and while I -was- working.... I would be standing for several hours a day and my feet wouldnt hurt. They look great too! Going to be wearing them for my next job interviews. Wash your hands everyone!"
Asics,5,"10.5 perfect fit, good traction for small hikes."
Asics,5,10/10 recommend.  I put tjese on and instant  happiest my feet have been in a looonnnggg time.  I am in between the 8 & 8.5 so I tjoI would try these.  Considero me hooked! I can't  wait to take them for a jog!

Asics,5,"After a couple of years looking for shoes that work for hammer toes, fallen arches and assorted other issues,  I tried on shoes all over my local shopping area. I knew what to look for and what brands worked for me. So I went to Amazon, I searched out my styles, read reviews and stashed the potential best shoes in my cart. When I was ready, I pulled the trigger. They fit so well, I don't even need to insert my orthotics. Very pleased. Got the same shoe in two colors. Now I'm good for another two or three years. KL"
Asics,5,"After reading the reviews about the size, I bought a half size larger than I normally wear and I am glad I did.  The size runs small.  I recommend to order a half size larger.  I bought these shoes to play pickleball.  I tired them on and I was impressed with the feel.  I have plantar fascitis and the heel gel cushion felt springy (a good thing).  I love these shoes.  Can't wait to play pickleball in these shoes."
Asics,5,After reading the reviews I decided to order these. Great choice!!  I’m on my feet all day in a warehouse and these instantly made a difference in how my feet feel at the end of the day. Great price and comfort.
Asics,5,After very worn out tennis shoes. I was skeptic for the price. However it helped with my back and comfortable right out the box. Wide size was a good fit for me.
Asics,5,All ok
Asics,5,Always but Asics
Asics,5,Always buy the same type of sneaker buy ASICS. They are very comfortable and we’re recommended by my podiatrist.
Asics,5,Always go with ASICS because they always fit.
Asics,5,Always my favorite.  Wear them til they fall apart
Asics,5,Always perfect fit.  Comfortable. Durable
Asics,5,Amazing sneaker. From day one I didn't have to break them in.  Plan to buy them in different colors !!!
Asics,5,"Another popular brand of running shoes were just too thin and flimsy for me. I got these based on the reviews. I searched for trail running shoes because I wanted something study, especially since I sprained my ankle last year.  I have been very happy with these, and love all the different color selections."
Asics,5,Apenas me las puse fue como si fueran mías desde siempre! Súper recomendadas!!!!
Asics,5,are true to size and comfortable for walking also
Asics,5,"Arrived on time, well packaged and as described by seller. Fit was great!"
Asics,5,arrived quickly and fit perfectly
Asics,5,"Arrived quickly and so comfortable! I used to get achy feet after running and my shoes would smell of sweat. Not so with these running shoes! My feet stay cool and don't get sore anymore! I did wear them once without socks and got blisters on my heel, but if you wear socks you shouldn't have a problem."
Asics,5,As always amazing product. Great quality.
Asics,5,"As always, ASICS provided another pair pf shoes that are comfortable and fit well.  This is my fifth or sixth pair of ASICS shoes."
Asics,5,"As always, you can never go wrong with Asics"
Asics,5,As always.  Love Asics.  They never fail me.
Asics,5,as expected
Asics,5,As expected
Asics,5,As expected.
Asics,5,as expected.  I have wide feet and these fit great with regular size
Asics,5,"As recommended by a podiatrist.  Very comfortable, supportive, love the gel that's like skechers, but much more substance to the shoe; love the blue color.  hopefully this shoe will last a long time."
Asics,5,"As soon as I laced them up and walked around the living room, I knew these were keepers. Very comfortable for walking or running. Love the color combination on these. Has a more rounded toe. I got size 7 in these and they fit fine. I can wear with or without socks. Highly recommend."
Asics,5,ASICS always. The absolute best athletic shoes.
Asics,5,"ASICS are  my go-to running shoes. However, I have always purchased the 1000 or 2000 series.  This Gel-Venture 7 has amazing comfort, just the right snug in just the right places.  My new go-to!"
Asics,5,"Asics are my favorite shoes for work and the gym.

I work in healthcare, so I'm on my feet a lot. I also have super high arches. These are the only shoes that I've found that give me enough support for a full day on my feet. I usually buy a couple pairs a year for work, and when I get a new pair, the old pair become my gym shoes.

I hope they always make these, because I'm going to be completely lost if I ever have to find a new brand."
Asics,5,ASICS are my go-to brand for workout/running shoes. They are always comfortable and fit great. I wear these every day to work (at a hospital) and have another pair for daily workouts (mainly running and hikes).
Asics,5,"Asics are my go-to shoe for running! These shoes fit great, provide good support and are light weight. I'd buy them all over again."
Asics,5,"Asics are my preferred brand. These ones are exactly as they are described. I have the same style in other colours. Great support. The only downside to these is when they are new they can be slippery on wet surfaces - even pavement. It goes away after they are worn for a while so there must be some kind of coating on the sole. I had the same issue with 2 other pairs of Asics, but not with a couple of other pairs I have bought in the past. Not a huge deal - just have to be careful the first few times out for a run.  The colour is super nice. Different from most I've seen"
Asics,5,Asics are one of my favorite running shoe. I work for FedEx and I'm on quite a few different types of terrain during my day and these shoes have handled it all. Definitely will buy these again as soon as I wear this pair out.
Asics,5,Asics are so durable and last forever! they fit great!
Asics,5,ASICS are the best for jogging and running and least amount of shin splints.
Asics,5,"ASICS are the best shoe for me as their wide widths meet my sizing needs. They are also incredibly comfortable. I am a walker, not a runner but I prefer these over traditional walking shoes. This pair is my sixth pair of ASICS over the years."
Asics,5,Asics are the best. Very comfy
Asics,5,ASICS are the only shoe I use for long power walks. They are perfect support for my feet.
Asics,5,Asics fit as expected. I buy 1/2 size larger than I normally wear. They are very comfortable.
Asics,5,Asics fit me perfectly. Only shoe I buy for working out.
Asics,5,ASICS gel sneakers provide the needed arch support for walking.  I am able to walk further and I don't experience the back pain or Sciatica I did after walking 2 miles.  I'm a fan.
Asics,5,"ASICS has always been my go to shoes.  Having mid foot arthrosis makes footwear so important to me.  At the end of 10 hours shift, I am still standing.  However, I will say that this model is a “HARD” on top and not as Flexible as the other model."
Asics,5,ASICS has been my favorite brand to walk & run in for 30yrs.
Asics,5,ASICS have always been my all time go to shoe! Super comfortable and lightweight.
Asics,5,Asics have been a consistently good shoe for me. Lots of support and a stiff sole that makes walking on all terrain comfortable.
Asics,5,Asics is a very good shoe at very reasonable price. Sturdy and well made.
Asics,5,"ASICS is my ‘Go-To’ brand for running/ walking shoes for my size 11.5 feet! As someone with high arches & plantar fasciitis, I appreciate ASICS shoes for being able to accommodate orthotic inserts for added support. I bought the dark blue for fall/winter in these shoes to wear with jeans & jackets. My feet are happy !"
Asics,5,Asics is my running shoe brand. Always fit right!
Asics,5,Asics is predictable.  I have worn Asics for working out for over 5 years.  They deliver.  Good support whether running or lifting.
Asics,5,Asics is the best brand I’ve ever worn!
Asics,5,Asics is the brand I have worn for years. 12 hours a day on your feet requires a shoe that can prevent leg and foot pain and asics is thar shoe for me
Asics,5,Asics is the only brand of shoe that fits my foot perfectly
Asics,5,Asics just run small I guess.  This is my 2nd pair of this brand of shoe.  They are FABULOUS shoes.  They just run small is all.  I regret nothing. :)
Asics,5,"Asics makes some of the best sneakers I've ever worn, so I thought why not get my GF a pair.  She loves them! The color and comfort are top of the line.  These arrived early and in perfect condition.  Thanks!"
Asics,5,ASICS running shoes are my favorite. They are always true to size. The price is a great value for the technology. I am a supinator and the gel Venture 7 trail running shoes are perfect keeping my foot neutral when it hits the running surface.

Asics,5,Being in healthcare I am on my feet for 12 hrs at a time so I needed shoes that can help me through my days. These are the shoes!! I didn't even need to break them in.

Asics,5,"Bought these for the gel feature in the heels.  Feel good so far
I replaced the shoelaces for a sturdier pair."
Asics,5,"bought these for walking, not running, but they are great.  Very light, very comfy, lots of support in the sole.  Good for someone with a high arch."
Asics,5,"Bought these shoes for running and could not be more satisfied with comfort and performance of these shoes. They are soft and supportive but not cheap. They support from ankle, heel to toe. Highly recommend these shoes for running."
Asics,5,Bought these to replace a very similar model and they feel oh so great. Didn't realize how much cushioning the old shoes had lost until slipping on these cuties! I will buy a 2nd pair to alternate wear.
Asics,5,Bought these to replace my old hiking boots since it’s summertime now and I wanted something lightweight. These are extremely comfortable and lightweight. They didn’t take long to break-in at all.
Asics,5,"Bought this for a friends birthday, she loves them, enjoys walking even more now."
Asics,5,Bought to wear
Asics,5,"Bought two pairs of these in two different colors and widths. I tried a couple of other brands that fit strangely or had uncomfortable seams, so decided to try Asics as my last pair bought from a local shop for over a hundred were Asics, though a previous model than these. They are both great. I bought a half size larger than my street shoes. I have wide feet with bones protruding at the front of my feet, and narrow heel. The other pair in red of this shoe I got the regular width and they fit perfectly. This pair in black I bought in wide, and though they work fine, they are slightly roomy. At first I tried with an insert, but then too snug. So unless your feet are really quite wide, I'd try the regular width. I wear them walking a lot, occasional jogging, and hiking and have had them for several months and they're still in great shape. Have good grip on the soles. The footbed is not plush, but I prefer them to memory foam ones popular now, which I don't find good for anything but casual wear."
Asics,5,"Came in great shape. The color is beautiful, and the shoes are comfortable. Would recommend."
Asics,5,Came on time and fit! Looks just like the picture. I reccomend. :)

I have plantar fasciitis; they fit too snugly to add insoles, but the shoes are supportive and cushiony enough that I don't need insoles.  They are too new right now to know how they will hold up, but they don't look super-sturdy and I wouldn't wear them for trail running or extended running."

Asics,5,"Fast shipping, great shoes"
Asics,5,"Feel comfortable, good support, but was a little tight across my left foot (toes). I ordered a wide, because last pair of ASICS I had was way too tight across both feet, and by the time they broke in enough to feel ok, the inner support had broke down enough to need to buy new shoes. They last about 6 months for running. Then can wear for awhile for just for everyday."
Asics,5,Feel grest

Asics,5,"Finally... a comfortable shoe I wear everyday now.  Fit perfectly right out of the box. The other half dozen pairs of walking/running shoes I own are now gathering dust in a closet because none of them come close to the comfort, fit, support of the Asics Gel-Venture 7 running shoe.  Will buy more of the same to alternate days of use.  I just wish I'd discovered them sooner!"
Asics,5,"Finding comfortable shoes has always been a challenge. I have a wide foot and a high instep. I had plantar fasciitis from not wearing shoes with adequate support so I am very picky. I recently retired from nursing after 30+ years and recognize the importance of good, high quality shoes. I have had Asics before and loved them. These shoes are the same excellent quality as before. The width is just right and the arch support perfect. I can walk distance in them without pain or cramping. Love them. I highly recommend these shoes."
Asics,5,"First let me say that they are Not black!  They are a dark navy. I saw these in a store- they didn’t have my size. Love love love the color it’s hard to find this color
They are very comfortable and once you’ve worn them a bit they feel even better
My husband has read about this brand and was impressed with the reviews and I like the price.
Think I’ll get another pair!!"
Asics,5,"First off, I tried these shoes on in store & didn't like the way they fit. I had been wearing the same shoes for 2 years & couldn't find anything that I liked. I decided to just give these a shot because so many people had mentioned they were comfortable. I must say the 1st day or 2 was like any typically break in period. After that I could tell these were going to be great. My feet start to hurt badly after standing for even 15 minutes without moving around. With these shoes that hasn't happened. I use them when on my spin bike & I can feel the cushion. It's amazing. I am a heavy set woman & I feel as though these shoes help support my body throughout the day. I bought a pair for my daughter as well & she loves them."

Only negative is they changed the laces and the new ones are skinny, I feel like I""m going to snap one just lacing up. Other than the bad choice of lacings, LOVE the new colors."

Asics,5,"Had the same shoe before and was glad that nothing had changed from then.  Too many times changes are made that aren't always as good.  These shoes are comfortable, durable, and exactly what I expected."
Asics,5,Hadn’t had new athletic shoes in many years. Things have changed in that amount of time. These are good and do have very good arch support. I bought a half size larger because of reviews. They are a little loose fitting because of this. They were a good price although a local store was having a sale once I had ordered these. I walk 10-14 miles a week so I need a good shoe. I do not think I will get the same number of years out of these shoes.
Asics,5,Happily perfect.
Asics,5,happy with purchase
Asics,5,Happy with the fit and comfort of these running shoes. I personally like the shoelaces. Other people said they were for little kids! Ha! I like the print and size for the shoe. This is a really good price for a running shoe & I've been using them several days a week!
Asics,5,Have arthritis in my feet and the support of these shoes really helping to make my life more pleasant.
Asics,5,Have been using Asics for years. Nice touch of pink to be girly but enough grey to match with everyday clothes.
Asics,5,"Have only worn these once, so we’ll see how durable they are. However, one jog in these gave me much less pain from plantar fasciitis and shin splints than my trusty Ryka’s. The laces are slippery, interestingly, so I needed to double knot."
Asics,5,Have several pairs!
Asics,5,Have worn these shoes for a couple of years. Love them!  Comfortable with good arch support!
Asics,5,"Have worn this brand alot, it didn't disappoint."

You guys ended up sending me two pair of these shoes! Both pair are too small which is so weird because asics size 9 has fit every time except one time
Please credit back to my credit card
Thanks! Donna"
Asics,5,Highly recommend if you work in healthcare
Asics,5,Highly recommend...
Asics,5,hiking.
Asics,5,How do you tie them at top with grosgrain loop and laces?
Asics,5,I ♥️♥️♥️this shoe! They are Comfortable and I will be ordering them again!
Asics,5,"i absolutely love them, they are super super comfy"
Asics,5,"I absolutely love these products! I’ve purchased ASICS shoes several times, super comfortable! Nice fit, insoles fit my feet well. Currently o own 4 pair. Switch them out to keep me clean and springy!"
Asics,5,I absolutely love these shoes! They fit perfectly and they are super supportive. I have plantar fasciitis and I don’t even need my inserts with these! This is the second pair of ASICS I’ve purchased and I’m sold. These are the best shoes for me.
Asics,5,I absolutely Love these. They are extremely comfortable
Asics,5,I actually received my ASICS a week before they were promised.  They look and feel great.  They really help me with my Plantar Fasciitis.
Asics,5,"I already bought another pair of this exact shoe, different color. Love them so much wanted the black and silver as well."
Asics,5,I already have one pair of these ASICS and wanted another pair. Great fit and they are comfortable to me.
Asics,5,"I alternate this pair with a blue pair. I work in a medical office and these are great shoes. I purchased these because the blue ones felt so good. They are true to size , durable, and great for those who work on their feet and need support."
Asics,5,I always buy ASICS because they so comfortable and don’t make my feet hurt.
Asics,5,I always buy this brand and style because it’s fits me perfectly!
Asics,5,I always have trouble finding shoes or running shoe but i was so suprised to be able to order with out even trying them on and perfect fit didnt hurt my feet being that i do suffer from chronic pain and i will be ordering more😊
Asics,5,"I always loved ASICS. These shoes are comfortable, but they don’t have the arch support like the ASICS I have bought in the past. I put an arch pad inside and it is better. Overall the shoes are brand new and look great!"
Asics,5,I always order the same size ASICS and these fit perfectly! So comfortable right out of the box!
Asics,5,"I always wear a 8.5 but these fit a bit snug. My toe is a little closer to the top of the toe box than I like and the shoe narrows a bit in the toe box area. But the shoe is supremely supportive, and comfortable. I've never owned another a pair of runners in this price rage that were such high quality. I would absolutely repurchase, but I would size up. I liked them so much, I bought a pair of the mens for my husband."
Asics,5,I am a 65 year old retired teacher helping at my grandkids school. The first day I started I thought my feet were gonna explode. Not only are these sneakers stylish they give me the support and comfort I need for an 8 hour day. I have a wide foot and these light weight sneakers come in wide. Great value for the dollar
Asics,5,I am a big girl and I like to hike a lot and frequently go on walks with 4 kids. These shows kept me supported and comfortable!
Asics,5,"I am a fairly new runner with no experience whatsoever with running shoes. I did a bit of reading into different types of foot and shoes that go with them. Based on my research I narrowed down to ASICS Gel Venture 7 and ordered a size 6.5. While the fit itself was good, I realized the toe box was narrow for me. So I returned size 6.5 regular and got a 6.5 Wide.

I feel very comfortable running in this shoe. I have a neutral arch and for me the fit is perfect and the shoe itself is light and easy to wear. I love how this variety has so many colors to choose from.

Overall, I’d recommend this to anyone who has a neutral arch and wants a shoe that doesn’t burn a hole in the wallet. This will be my to-go brand now!"
Asics,5,"I am a female, I run five miles every morning, and I have recently been plagued with mild to medium metatarsalgia (ball of foot pain) wearing my old ASICS Gel Trabuco Trail Running shoes. I read that these Asics Gel-Venture 7 trail running shoes are supposed to be highly cushioned and useful in stemming metatarsal pain. So, I ordered a pair and have been running in them every morning for the past nineteen days. They started off rather stiff and it took me a few days to get just the right sock combination. I have narrow feet and am a senior, so my feet are bonier than they were in my youth. I also still use an additional metatarsal gel pad since the balls of my feet hurt just a bit (but not nearly as much as they did in my older shoes) without the additional pads.

Now these shoes feel perfectly comfortable and I am loath to take them off after my daily run. I highly recommend this Asics model and have since ordered a second pair as backup. I do not want to be caught without a pair waiting for whenever these wear out (that I assume will be a long time from now based on my other previous and current Asics running and walking shoes). Numerous color choices too. I usually wear 7.5 N shoes, but the 7.5.M work just fine since I know that I generally use a double-layer running sock and the metatarsal gel pads.

I highly recommend this running shoe!"
Asics,5,"I am a nurse and I really need to wear comfortable shoes at work without spending too much. Saw a lot of coworkers wearing this brand so I tried it and I am so happy that I bought a pair. Very nice color, very comfortable and fits very well."
Asics,5,"I am a nurse who spends long days on my feet, and this particular model of the ASICS line is the most comfortable for me. I have tried many other brands, and even other models of ASICS shoes don't fit as well. There's plenty of room for my long toes, and the foot bed fits my foot like it was a custom insole. I have very little arch naturally, and other shoes with too high an arch support actually rub a blister on the bottom off my foot. This ASICS Venture model fits the bill."
Asics,5,I am a walker.  I have been having problems with my feet hurting. Was told to get these and I walk 5 to 6 miles a day..  I’ve been walking  in these shoes for 2 months now and they still look brand new.  Helped with my feet to not hurt  also !  Great fit. And great comfort!
Asics,5,I am disabled and sought this sneaker for my physical therapy. Very shock absorbant and thst provides serious comfort for my injuries as I walk.
Asics,5,"I am familiar with Asics as I have been wearing them for years. I was told early on to buy a size larger than what you normally wear.  That was true with these as well.  I normally wear a 7 1/2-8 and I ordered 8.5 and they fit perfectly.  They are comfortable, lightweight and before I got these, my back would hurt and my plantar fibromas would hurt my feet. Not anymore. I got a second pair to have in case I wear these out and they no longer sell them when I need them.  Great shoes!"
Asics,5,I am in love with these shoes. This is my second pair. I got one a few months ago for running and I got this pair for work. They feel amazing on my feet. I even got a pair for my daughter. She is size 7 and I got a 7. My feet measured at 7.5 but I got a 9 and it feels just right. I had to go through a few purchases and returns to figure out the appropriate size. I wear a normal thickness pair of socks with them. They are quite attractive as well. They don’t feel cheap. Price is very reasonable!
Asics,5,"I am in my 70s and love these shoes.  My ankles, legs and knees feel better."
Asics,5,I am OBSESSED with these shoes!!!! They so comfortable and i love the color of them. A lot of people complained that the color was different than the photos but mine looked exactly as the photos did. I originally got these for running but i find myself wearing them for everyday use just because they are so comfortable. Highly recommend!!!
Asics,5,"I am on my feet a lot, and these are still the most comfortable shoes I've found for that. I've purchased these a few times now. However, I am still disappointed at how quickly they start not feeling so good, but honestly, almost all shoes do that fairly quickly for me. It's a shame to have to continually replace shoes, but bare feet doesn't work for me."
Asics,5,I am on my feet all day and these are the best shoes so far I have found!
Asics,5,"I am on my feet all day everyday whether it's concrete, asphalt or other. I love them so far and since I have wide feet they fit perfectly without any toes getting pinched."
Asics,5,I am on my feet all day so I needed new shoes. I go through several pairs a year. So far they are very comfortable and U don't need added inserts.
Asics,5,"I am so glad I bought these shoes. They're my first pair of Asics. I don't think I have even tried on a pair at the store. I took their measurements at face value and purchased a 7.5 wide. They fit amazingly well. By the way, my foot is barely even a wide. I just wanted a little room for swelling in the summer. I originally bought them for camping, but now wear them around town for errands and daily walking. Great arch support too without feeling like there's a rock in my shoe."
Asics,5,"I am used to champion gusto shoes, but I am upset about their latest increase in price and decrease in quality, so I looked for something else. These offer more support than the champions I had, and are a bit heavier - in a good way.
My feet would hurt after running with champions, and they don't with these.
I can't speak of durability yet, but so far I am happy.

I got the same size that I have on champions and on all other shoes, and it worked great."
Asics,5,"I am very happy with my purchase. Great shoe, does not hurt my feet and has good soles."
Asics,5,I am very happy with the fit and color.  I have problems with shoes since my feet are arthritic.  These are very comfortable and offer the arch support I need for my flat feet.  Couldn’t have done better going to the store to try them out.
Asics,5,"I am very satisfied with these Asics shoes!  I have had issues with my feet hurting & I am so happy to say they fit perfectly & are so comfortable.  I ordered a wide & am glad I did because it gives me the needed room in the toe area.  I love the color - they are navy with silver, not black.  I saw others speak of the color & I was hoping they would be the color on the picture & they are.
Every day I say ""I love these shoes"". (:"
Asics,5,"I bought a pair of same shoe in blue. I have trouble finding sneakers that fit well. Very comfortable, so I bought another pair."
Asics,5,"I bought size 7.5 W. I use it to jog in the park and in the track at YMCA.  The shoes wrap my feet well.  It fits just right.  I recommend medium-thick socks.  You can wear normal thickness socks, but I use a little thick socks to feel better on my feet. I have good feet health.  If you have feet issues, this shoes may not work for you.  I am not sure.  I usually jog from 2-3 miles and it works fine.  I have not tried to jog more than 3 miles since that is all I could jog.  Also, wear and tear depends on how often you use it.  I use 2,3 times a week from 1-2 hours in the past 3 months and it is still good.  I hope my information helps before you decide to buy this product."
Asics,5,"I bought the size 7 for my wife and she is very happy. It fit perfectly and they are a wonderful shoe for walking long hours, even for hiking or running."
Asics,5,I bought them for my sister and she loves them! Her favorite pair.
Asics,5,"I bought these as a Christmas gift.  The left shoe has a defect in the stitching,  what can be done,  I love the comfort of these shoes"
Asics,5,"I bought these for a trip overseas during which I'd be doing some hiking. Because I've had other shoes in this line, I didn't put them on until I got there. They were very comfortable from day one and didn't require any breaking in. It was a relief to switch to them from some non-running sneakers I had worn the previous day. They had great traction on trails. I highly recommend them."
Asics,5,I bought these for my wife and she loves them
Asics,5,I bought these for work. I have a Heel Spur & need good arch support.  They are great!
Asics,5,I bought these for working out because I had read they were great for planter fasciitis support. And are they ever. My feet haven't felt this good in months and I'm back to 10k steps a day.
Asics,5,I bought these last minute for my trip to Zion. I needed some trail runners to hike the narrows since I didn’t want to buy water shoes. They were great on the hikes both land and water. Highly recommend these.
Asics,5,"I bought these running shoes about two months ago after a (more expensive) paid I'd bought got holes in the toe box. I wanted to give those shoes a break every other day since I run 5-6 days/week. These have held up really well. There is a bit more foam than I was expecting, but it makes the shoes really comfortable, even during longer runs. No problems so far!"
Asics,5,"I bought these shoes as I’m starting to take up running this year. So far, shoes are very comfortable and there is a lot of cushion. Feet feel fine after runs. Legs/lungs are another story, but that is just because I’m out of shape"
Asics,5,"I bought these shoes as my indoor, covid quarantine workout shoes. They are used approximately 1 to 1.5 hours a day during HIIT/Strength/kickboxing/Cardio workouts and they are holding up quite well. Very supportive. The wide width is essential for me."
Asics,5,I bought these shoes for running. I was looking for some extra support as my feet have been hurting the the Nike shoes I usually run in. These gel shoes are well padded and provide lots of support. They look good on and have helped my feet a lot!
Asics,5,"I bought these shoes for walking and working out. They are still fairly new so I cant comment on durability. However, they are super comfortable and provide much needed comfort for my plantar fasciitis. I am usually between a 9.5 and 10 medium width. I got the 10 and it still has room in the toe area. O wore it with a thick socks and still had a little wiggle room. I think I'll be able to add an insole if I need additional support later on. The shoes feel light weight, yet sturdy. I did my run in these and they were incredibly comfortable. I am pleased with this purchase."
Asics,5,"I bought these shoes for work, as I work out side in all the different weather elements and needed a good shoe"
Asics,5,I bought these shoes to use on my desk treadmill. I walk about 50 miles per week and they've help up great after a couple months of use. No pain or fatigue at the end of the day!
Asics,5,I bought these to replace my old Noosa Gel sneakers. Just like my old trusty sneakers they allow me to workout without my plantar fasciitis flairing up. The flat laces stay tied through an entire two-hour workout too. This is a feature I didn't realize I needed till I had it!
Asics,5,I bought this shoes for work. I'm a veterinary technician and I'm always on my feet. I instantly fell in love with these shoes and how comfortable they are! I wore then to go hiking on a 3 mile train with over 100+ stairs and my feet were not uncomfortable! Let's just say I'll be ordering another pair and I referred these shoes to my coworkers. I did order 1/2 size up which was recommended in the comments and they fit perfectly
Asics,5,"I broke my foot, and when I was slowed to wear sneakers, they were very comfortable.  My foot is normal again!"
Asics,5,"I buy this brand and this style exclusively. I have a high arch and I tend to supinate just a tad, so this neutral cushioning works well for me."
Asics,5,I buy this brand for its support and it never fails me.
Asics,5,"I can't vouch for how long they last yet, but these shoes are very comfy and supportive! I'm really particular about fit, and these feel great. I usually wear between a 8.5-9 in shoes, and I needed an 8 in these, so I would maybe get a half size down than what you usually wear."
Asics,5,"I can't wait to get these in more colors. I have had get and these shoes are padded in the forefoot. After bunion surgery, I can walk my dog with these"
Asics,5,"I didn't realize how important it was to have good shoes until I got these.  My knees used to kill me after doing my Orangetheory class, and now they only hurt very little.  I love them.  Glad I bought 2 pair."
Asics,5,"I didn't think I was going to like the shoes the first two minutes, then the memory form kicked in YAY! I was nervous about buying tennis shoes under $100 but they are working out great."
Asics,5,I do a lot of walking and they are really comfortable so far. If anything changes I will update my review.
Asics,5,"I don’t have any foot issues, but I‘m on my feet all day at work and these shoes are awesome. I just purchased a pair of both New Balance and Nike running shoes, both claimed to provide cushion and support, yet neither did.
These have great support for a running shoe and noticeable cushion just where it’s needed. I’m buying another pair, very impressed!"
Asics,5,I don't like laced up shoes but have to wear them now from doctor recommendation. The space at the toes makes me more comfortable. Breathable fabric keeps my toes cool. Does not pull my socks tight on the toes.
Asics,5,"I don't run, but I like the support of a good running shoe.  These are very comfortable, although I ended up putting in orthotics for more arch support.  I thought I would be able to remove the insoles, but they are glued in, so it fits a little snugger than I am used to."
Asics,5,"I don't run.  I work out at the gym and use them for a Bootcamp class, which involves sprinting at times.  They are so comfortable that I forgot I was wearing them and started doing yard work.  I immediately went into the house to change, but that is how well they fit!"
Asics,5,"I DONT TYPICALLY WEAR ASICS, BUT THESE ARE THE BEST SHOES, COMFORT WISE. THEY FORM TO MY FOOT AND FEEL GREAT. I WORK LONG HOURS, DENTAL HYGIENE SO A GOOD SHOE IS A MUST! A+++ GREAT VALUE TOO."
Asics,5,I feel like I’m walking on carpet the full 7 hours of standing at work
Asics,5,I finally found a sneaker that fits my ankle brace. No more Birkenstock’s everyday!
Asics,5,"I finally found a wide shoe! Very comfortable, I actually ordered two more pairs. Highly reccomend."
Asics,5,I find it hard to find walking/running shoes that work with my A Keeley’s tendon. These shoes are perfect they are comfortable and lightweight
Asics,5,I find these Asics athletic shoes fit great. There is good cushioning to insoles.  I have used Asics for years now. Always satisfied.
Asics,5,I gave these as a gift.  She said they were the most comfortable sneakers she ever had.  They didn’t need broken in first - they were wonderful right from the first time she put them on.
Asics,5,I gave theses to my Daughter for Xmas gift she's wearing them all the time great shoes
Asics,5,I generally buy 4 pairs of shoes just for my work. I generally walk about 10 to 18 miles daily. I honestly can say I am rarely impressed when I try a new pair. Now....these were so comfortable when I put them on. They hugged my feet. After a 15 he day on my feet on concrete.....my feet felt awesome. I never buy the same shoe twice.....I will definitely buy this shoe more than once.
Asics,5,I got the blue- the color and fit are spot on.  For me as a matter of preference I like light weight very flexible sneakers and the construction of these are a heavy weight and clunky feeling.  So if you like a type of shoe that feels more like a hiking then a running- walking shoe this is for you.  I wore these shoes every day for three weeks trying to break them in thinking they would feel less clunky but it never happened.  I broke down and bought  Nike flex fit and they’re perfect for a barely there feeling that I prefer.  This is a good sturdy heavy duty feeling shoe if that is what you’re after.
Asics,5,I got the same size as my old shoes and they fit perfect. They are comfortable and look nice.
Asics,5,I got them for my wife and she loves them. And the got here 5 days early. Supper fast shipping and it was not even prime. Y’all are the best thinks guys and girls!!!!!!
Asics,5,"I got these for a replacement of an old pair.  They fit and feel great!  Love the support!  You never know what you are getting ordering from ordering on line,  but these are worth the purchase.  I walk 5 miles 5 to 6 times a week and they make the trail feel like I could do more!"
Asics,5,I got these for my mom for her birthday and she says how comfortable they are. She keeps saying how supported her feet art and that they look nice too.
Asics,5,I got these yesterday and took them straight out of the box to wear to the gym.  They felt great!  No breaking in needed.  These are just perfect for me to walk around the track and do my workout.  I might need to get another pair just to mix it up a little.
Asics,5,"I had a different pair of Arias bought from a discount shoe store locally. Honestly not sure of the exact style/model/intention (i.e. Running, walking etc). However I work at a veterinary clinic, constantly on my feet. My old Arias began to form to my movements and feet and I felt like I was ""falling forward"" for lack of a better term- like all my weight was moving to the front of the shoe and I was primarily on the balls of my feet, causing me to ""hobble"" at home once I took them off.
I researched the best types of sneakers for vet-type workers, and Arias was still among the list. The visual style was different to my current and I was intrigued, I'd noticed the arch between the heel and ball of foot and hoped I wouldn't have this sloping issue anymore.
Tried them on and ohhh man they feel ah-mazing! My feet are no longer sore. Thankful I found these!"
Asics,5,"I had an old pair from years ago side 7 I realized that my toes felt sometimes pinched at the toe and there was barely enough string to tie a bow.  Since I now have a back injury and I'm attending PT  My therapist said you wear Asics they are wonderful, great support.  Realizing I needed new shoes and probly a size up I took a chance and ordered 71/2 wide. They are wonderful no cramped toes plenty of laces I've been wearing them now to PT for 2 weeks and my balance is better and my feet feel great. Yes I bought 2 pair!"
Asics,5,"I had another pair in a different color and I absolutely loved them so now that it's time to replace I found these on Amazon and they are perfect!  So comfortable for all-day wear, exercise, whatever!  Love them!!"
Asics,5,I had another woman wearing these and actually I thought they looked good. My wife loves the wide width she wears them with day dresses and jeans .
Asics,5,"I had my brooks shoes for many, many years but they were falling apart and the ones I tried on in the store didn't fit the same. I ran across these asics while researching good walking/every day shoes and decided to give them a try. Glad I did... they're very light weight and comfortable. Couldn't be happier with them."
Asics,5,I had the ASICS gel venture 5 previously and loved them I got these and they fit the same like I hoped ! Very comfortable
Asics,5,I had these shoes for 6 months and my ankle was starting to hurt during walks so I thought it must be time for a new pair. I love the color of these and didn't realize how much the the inside had worn down on the old pair. These are so comfortable and I love that they stabilize my ankle that bothers me.
Asics,5,"I had thought I would keep the Ryka sneaker that I ordered along with this pair of Asics, but this has more support on the sides.  That said, the orthotic-style footbed from the Ryka's made my Asics feel great!  Now I have ordered some inserts to make the Asics fit perfectly.  Footbed is comfy and very comfortable.  Look forward to wearing these for a while."
Asics,5,"I have a bag Achilles..absolutly no pain with these shoes. Had tried more expensive shoes, exercises, etc. That's worked surprisingly well. I'm on my feet up to14 hrs a day at work."
Asics,5,I have a difficult time finding shoes for underpronation and totally flat feet.  So many shoes cause pain. These are just great.
Asics,5,"I have A LOT of problems with my knees.  Every step has been excruciating!!  Since WFH I’ve been working out more and running.  This has made my knees worse instead of better sadly.  Someone said hey it might be your shoes!!

I was given these as reference and read the reviews.  I am not lying when I say, the pain in my legs lessened as soon as I started wearing them.

They are not narrow like Nike can run.  The fit exactly as I expected, but better.  I love them so much, I might get a second pair!!"
Asics,5,I have a narrow foot and this shoe works well.  I have bought 3 pair so far.  I do use an arch support with them however.
Asics,5,"I have a pair of the Gel-Venture 6 & I really enjoyed it. They are super comfortable, super supportive. I wear them to & from work each day, sometimes I end up standing on the train & they really helped my feet. These ones are working out as well. I've definitely found a brand of walking sneakers to support"
Asics,5,"I have a slightly narrow, low volume foot and these fit great, better than the Brooks shoes I usually buy."
Asics,5,"I have a tough time finding a shoe that doesn’t hurt my feet after a long extended day. I’m a teacher and walk approximately 5,000 steps a day! I’ve bought shoes that were priced over a 100 dollars, but these are by far the best! I will be ordering more! I finally found the shoe that is comfortable and doesn’t aggravate my plantar fasciitis!"
Asics,5,I have a wide flipper of a foot. This shoe fits perfect! Holds in my little toe without rubbing it raw but not leaving it unprotected from stubbings and bangs from things I sometimes run into working at night.
Asics,5,"I have a wide foot, and have never been confident to order anything online because I always wanted to try them on before purchaseing. I am so happy that I no longer have to worry about this. ASICS 8 1/2 wide are so comfortable and fit my feet perfectly. I also love that they are durable where my feet are widest, so they will last longer than many other wide shoes I've purchase from other brands."
Asics,5,I have absolutely loved these shoes!
Asics,5,I have always bought cheap work shoes because I go through them so quickly.  I got tired of buying shoes all the time and decided to get a pair of Asics because I heard such good things about them and wanted a good workout shoe.  I LOVED my workout shoes so much that I bought these for my work shoes and it was honestly the best decision I have made.  I used to always buy Nike sneakers but they never lasted.  These are the most comfortable (and versatile) sneaker I have gotten.  It's perfect for work or working out.  Would highly recommend.
Asics,5,I have always had an extremely hard time finding shoes at department stores. I take a size 11 with foot problems. I left very disappointed and defeated. These sneakers have not let me down yet. I have ordered many times already . They last & fit perfectly.
Asics,5,"I have always had trouble getting shoes in a size 5, but not any more."
Asics,5,I have always like Asics shoes and these are no exception. They were comfortable from the 1st time I put them on.
Asics,5,"I have always loved the comfort and lightweight feeling of Aasics, and these are exactly that! My feet don't feel like they've just been running, and don't get as sweaty, in these Aasics."
Asics,5,"I have always worn wide shoes, and these are the first cute, wide athletic shoes I have ever been able to find. These are comfortable enough to let me walk around all day at work or to go for a brisk walk at night and not have super sore feet."
Asics,5,I have an old pair of Asics I love so I got these to replace them and they are great
Asics,5,"I have another pair that were worn out, I almost bought a different brand but am so happy I landed on these. Great price, exact fit in size, and the wide fit is perfect. I have a WIDE EE foot, for all you other wide foot people.
Also, lots of comments on color which is funny, the photo is pretty accurate now, black with the detailing in a grey, so it's super sleek like I hoped."
Asics,5,"I have been a fan of ASICS for decades. This pair continues that trend. The fit is fantastic. The shoes are very light, yet supportive. Very happy."
Asics,5,"I have been a fan of Asics Gel for years. Having lower back issues for decades, wearing a shoe with cushion is a necessity. Fit is perfect, and the shoe is well constructed. Highly reccomend them for comfort, and style."
Asics,5,"I have been addicted to gel venture for few years and thought about investing on another pair for exercise only. With pendamic, was trying to save on money so thought to try Asics jolt series and l was not happy. It was not comfy so l returned it. Bought this and my feet are ecstatic. Gel venture wouldn't disappoint you. Try 1!"
Asics,5,"I have been buying the Gel Venture 5s for the last several years.  I found my running stride a little over a year ago and didn’t want to mess with a good thing.  However, I developed a stress fracture in my foot last year while training for a half marathon and then noticed discomfort in the same place in my foot this year once I started wearing a new pair of 5s.  My husband (who is an ultra marathoner) suggested that I try wide shoes and since the 5s didn’t have a wide option in my size I decided to try this model.

Immediately when I put them on I noticed a huge difference in foot support.  It felt like I was walking on a cloud!  I wore them around for a few days and then finally tested them on two different treadmill runs yesterday without incident.  I typically run anywhere from 4-6 miles on average 4 or 5 days a week + daily walks and toddler chasing :).  I’m so glad I tried out the Gel 7s.  Wanted to share this review to help others who may be in the same boat I was- stuck on the 5s and not sure whether going with a newer model will be better.  I can say with certainty that they are much better!"
Asics,5,I have been having foot pain. My Foot Dr. said this was the best shoe for me. It is very comfortable!
Asics,5,I have been having trouble with finding shoes that fit right after having kids. These shoes were a perfect fit right out of the box. Hopefully they hold up well too!
Asics,5,"I have been purchasing and wearing ASIC brand shoes for about 4 years, very satisfied with the fit and the way the support my feet."
Asics,5,"i have been using Asics running shoes for more than 15 years and they never disappoint. Quality is great and fi is always as expected. They are super consistent, will definitely keep buying them"
Asics,5,I have been wearing Asics shoes for years.  I bought 2 pair of the Asics Gel Venture in different colors.  They fit well and are very comfy.
Asics,5,"I have big wide feet and shoes are hard to find. These are perfect, I love them"
Asics,5,I have bought a couple pairs of this style in different colors - very happy with the fit and the comfort.
Asics,5,I have bought ASICS running shoes for many years and love them so I bought these Gel-7’s for trail running and am very happy with them. I ran in them yesterday: they fit as expected and have the support and stability needed for off-road running. I chose the Carrier Gray-Violet Blush colors and love the look: soft and pretty.
Asics,5,I have bought these in the past and the price with Amazon was the best I have found.
Asics,5,"I have bought this show multiple times and I am always happy.  Great support. I add a really good insole since I am on my feet so much, and that helps with my arch pain.  Will buy again and again!"
Asics,5,I have committed to focusing on myself in 2020.  What better than feeling better with eating right and getting some exercise.  I have a decent pair of Filas but wanted to try Asics.  My son who is a runner swears by them.  I have no intention of being a runner but I do walk six days per week.  I got the 6 wide and these shoes felt like they were made for me the moment I put them on.  I've walked in them for the last 24+ days and they still feel great.  I also love the color combination.  Not too flashy but super cute.  So far they have been great.
Asics,5,"I have difficulty finding shoes 👟 in length size 12 but only wear medium width. So much easier ordered 2 pairs, fit great, look nice."
Asics,5,I have foot problem and this really helps
Asics,5,"I have had a hard time finding shoes that fit and help with my planter fastidious/ heal spur. When I put them one I was so surprised when I started walking no pain in my foot at all...... these are great support and comparable.  I would recommend these to anyone with flat feet , bone spur , planters fastidious.  The best shoes ever."
Asics,5,I have had alot of problems with my left foot lately with a bone spur and these shoes have been the only things to help me!
Asics,5,"I have had foot surgery and it didn't help the pain I have. I decided that I can be in pain and be sedimentary,  or I can be in pain and be active.  I walk 10+ miles a day seven days a week.  These shoes are amazing and I have little to no discomfort when walking in them! After spending 100's of dollars on shoes that sit in my closet because they hurt too bad to wear, these are an absolute God send! I love them!"
Asics,5,"I have had plantar fasciitis many times in the past. I’ve been working on a 2,021 miles in 2021 challenge with friends and needed some supportive shoes to wear to walk and at work where I’m on my feet a LOT. These fit my inserts & looked cute, too! Definitely pleased with these."
Asics,5,I have had three versions of this shoe.  All of the Venture shoes are true to size and very comfortable for all day wear.  I will buy others when the need comes.
Asics,5,"I have long been a fan of Asics, however over the years have learned that they tend to run short and narrow.  The narrow is perfect for my AA foot.  The lasts couple of Asics I have bought ended up being on the short side, so I sized up half a size this time.  It is a perfect fit.  These are already my new favorite athletic shoes.

The only downside is that the ""black/silver"" color is more of a deep navy instead of true black.  But it's not a deal-breaker -- I'm still keeping them."
Asics,5,I have lots of problems with my feet. I stand and walk alot at work. So far they have help my so much
Asics,5,I have multiple colors of the shoe. It is the most comfortable walking shoe that I have worn yet. I have plantars fasciitis and with the shoe I don't feel it at all
Asics,5,"I have neuropathy in my feet, along with plantar fasciitis.  I'm a nurse and I'm in my feet ALOT. Since I bought these shoes I have been 90% pain free. That is a very big improvement for me. I bought a second pair for my daughter.  She is a server also with plantar fasciitis.  I can't wait for her to try them."
Asics,5,"I have never seen a size 11.5 for women...turns out, it is perfect.  I love, love this shoe and am so comfortable running.  It looks great too!"
Asics,5,"I have not been on a run yet as I’ve been sick but, just walking around they fit perfectly.  Hope they replace Nike shoes."
Asics,5,I have owned many pairs of Asics running shoes.  This shoe is definitely a trail shoe which I like for walking on trails in my area.  It is a little heavier than some of my other Asics.  I normally wear a size 9 and this shoe fits as expected.  I have noticed that my past two Asics have been a little bigger in the heal area than my previous shoes.  I have used an insert and they now fit fine.
Asics,5,"I have plantar faceitis and I love these shoes.  The have plenty of support and cushion for walking.
I buy this brand often"
Asics,5,I have plantar fasciitis and this is the perfect shoe to purchase .  All my pain has gone away.  This shoe  is perfect .
Asics,5,I have problems to find a shoe that fits me and this complies very nice!
Asics,5,"I have purchased these shoes before, They are always great"
Asics,5,I have purchased this brand shoe before so I knew what size to order.  Pretty true to size.  Love the color and comfort.  Would purchase again.
Asics,5,I have Reynauds and try and purchase warm shoes.  I also work in healthcare and need comfortable shoes.  These are perfect for my needs.  They are winter running shoes and are a little thicker that the summer version.  LOVE THEM!
Asics,5,I have several other asics shoes this one runs large
Asics,5,I have several pairs of Asics. Whenever I buy a different brand for whatever reason I wish I had bought Asics. So from now on this is my brand. They look good and feel good. I only use them for walking and not running... but I am a fast walker and I walk a lot.
Asics,5,"I have severe patellar femoral chondromalacia and this shoes helps a lot! Its comfortable, light and matches my uniform too! Been looking for the perfect shoes to help me with my 12hrs shifts! Im glad i bought this!"
Asics,5,I have terribly hard to fit (WIDE) feet and these are great. I also had a bad sesamoid and was able to wear these before I had surgery on it. Materials are good. Breathability good. I use them as trail runners (because it's so hard to find my size) and they do really well even in mud.
Asics,5,"I have to deal with a few foot issues--bunions and thinning of pads of my feet, causing nerve pain and soreness when the shoe is not supportive. The foot doc recommended Asics. For at least 10 years now, Asics are the only shoe I buy for walking/hiking. At first, I tried others, thinking it can't make that much of a difference, but I am here to say, at least for my issues, Asics can't be beaten!

This shoe is in different shades of grey with the tiniest strip of blue, which is exactly what I wanted--PLEASE, stop making us ladies wear only pink, purple, and neon blue! The fit is great, comfortable, and very supportive. Highly recommend this shoe."
Asics,5,I have trouble finding just the right shoe for comfort as well as style.  I have two other pair of Asics which I have wore for a long time.  These are fashionable as well as super comfortable!  Very glad I ordered them.
Asics,5,"I have trouble finding my size on shelves. I only wear Asics because they have gray arch support for wide feet, and I get great color choices this way. Stores usually only have a few boring wide options in stock."
Asics,5,I have very high arches and normal sneakers are not very supportive.  These running shoes were comfort to my soles.  I will be buying a second pair soon.
Asics,5,I have very long walks daily . This shoes are perfect for that.
Asics,5,"I have very sensitive feet. Buying shoes has never been an enjoyable process.
Having plantar fasciitis makes the search more difficult.
I was very pleased to find a shoe that gives me the support I need. I wear them from the moment I get dressed and begin walking around.

Durable - 100%
Color vibrancy - 100%
Longevity of support - 100%
Great for working out, walking, climbing, standing.
Shock absorbing is great.
Easy to clean if I get them dirty."
Asics,5,I have waited for two years to find shoes that I LOVE.  I found them in this  shoe and ordered me another pair.
Asics,5,I have wide feet with a high arch. I love how comfortable these shoes are for my feet. I was able to wear them all day with no issues! Finally a shoe that didn't hurt my feet after a few hours of wear.
Asics,5,"I have worn Asics for a long time, way back when I was jogging. Now, I am just walking. Still choose Asics."
Asics,5,"I have worn Asics for the last 6 years, they have been the only ones I can wear to help support my back and overall body."
Asics,5,"I have worn ASICS for years. Great shoe, don't have to break in.  I use these for walking."
Asics,5,"I have worn Asics Gel-Venture sneakers for several years.  They fit as expected, with toe room that I am unable to get in other brands. I ordered these because of the extra shoe lace holes to help keep the shoes from sliding on my heels, and the only complaint I have is that the laces are too short for me to use those holes comfortably with my wide feet. For me and my needs, this is a minor issue so I still rate the shoes as a five star overall."
Asics,5,I have worn ASICS running shoes as tennis shoes for some time now and have reordered them again. Perfect fit and very comfortable.
Asics,5,I have worn this shoe for a long time. Very comfortable and great colors!
Asics,5,I have worn this shoe to do a 5k and also a 5 mile hike through the forest as well as my everyday workouts. this shoe is very comfortable. I especially like it for going downhill. I used to get pain in my toes with my other shoes but not with this one. Overall I love this shoe. Also the laces do not come untied like my other shoes. I had to replace the lacings with silicone lacings. i don't think I will have to do so with this shoe.
Asics,5,I have worn this sneaker for years and this is the first year that an 8 1/2 was too small. I reordered a size 9 through Amazon and the fit is fine.
Asics,5,"I haven’t had a chance to wear these outdoors yet, (too snowy, wet, and slippery). I have worn them in the house and they are a very good fit."
Asics,5,I haven’t worn these out yet - only in house. I like them and they’re comfortable. For me an extra wide would be better but think these will be ok. I struggle with buying shoes but think I will like these.
Asics,5,I hike these are amazing!
Asics,5,I honestly love the cushion and material its made from. The only issue I had is working 12 hrs a day really strains my feet. Maybe my feet swell towards the end of the day...but I really feel my toes sore from the tightness of it. Don't recommend fit as expected if you have wide feet (T_T)
Asics,5,"I immediately put these on and wore them all day to try and “break them in” as you do with new shoes. But these are so comfortable right off the bat! They grip the ground and feel more stable than I anticipated. I absolutely love these shoes. The color and look of them is ver appealing as well.
They were just a bit bigger than I anticipated, but nothing major."
Asics,5,I just loved these shoes... Best for running
Asics,5,"I just started going back to the gym and needed a good comfy shoe, and This is definitely it. Good price, comfortable, durable, lightweight and they even look good!"
Asics,5,"I know I can order a pair of Asics Gel Ventures and they will fit like the others I have.  The cushion and arch support are substantial, compared to other brands that are flimsy. Have received several compliments on the lavender/gray color scheme."
Asics,5,"I like Asics for a multiple fitness training schedule.  They can take the impact of cardio, including dance cardio; and this pair has the sturdiness needed for muscle conditioning on the mat.  As someone with a slim foot, the Asics brand works well as a general fitness shoe without too much sliding around.  If you add in a half orthopedic insert they are nearly perfect!"
Asics,5,"I like Asics sneakers for my workouts. These shoes fit as expected and are very comfortable. I agree with the post(s) that said the laces seem thinner. It's not a big problem, but it does mean that I have to double tie my shoes so I don't inadvertently step on the laces and untie them."
Asics,5,"I like ASICS!  Years ago my orthopedic surgeon recommended this brand to me while I was in recovery from a total hip replacement.  I recouped using my ASICS while in physical therapy.
I use them daily to walk...great shoe!"
Asics,5,"I like everything about the shoe: price, fit, comfort and stylish."
Asics,5,I like everything about these shoes.
Asics,5,I like everything about these shoes. They are just what I’ve been looking for.
Asics,5,"I like everything about this shoes, very airy, comfortable. This is my second Asics shoes, am a nurse and  on my feet most of the time at work so it really works for me. Love the gel insole!"
Asics,5,I like everything about this sneaker—good padding and wide enough for my feet.  I always go a 1/2 size larger in ASICS shoes.
Asics,5,I like how they fit and I've had good luck in the past with how long the shoes last. I do think they should change the color description as this is definitely not black/silver but is more of a navy.
Asics,5,I like how this shoes fit and specially how they “hold” my feet.
Asics,5,I like it so much
Asics,5,I like it.
Asics,5,I like my née shoes. Fit is good.
Asics,5,I like that this style had color options that were not bright and bold.
Asics,5,I like the colors but very stiff.
Asics,5,I like the comfort and feel of wearing the shoes. They’re great for moderate distance walking. I have only done 5 to 5.5 miles on a walk while using these shoes. I’m sure that they’re great for longer distance walks though.
Asics,5,I like the fit and gel cushion sole. Good shoe for work or walking.
Asics,5,I like the product band I us them for work
Asics,5,"I Like the shape, I bought in Gray and green, looks nice, the mesh  is breathable the synthethic parts up the shoes,  do not bother me. The quality versus price still good."
Asics,5,"I like the shoe and will use it, but I wish I had ordered a half size smaller than I did as I have a narrow foot and it seems a bit big."
Asics,5,"I like the support, fit and style of these, gotten a few comments about the neat color"
Asics,5,I like the thick sole and roomy toe area. Good cushioning on heel.
Asics,5,I like them
Asics,5,I like them better then the other pair I own. I was concerned buying shoes online but these fit and look great!
Asics,5,"I like them fine, they fit fine and are comfortable"
Asics,5,I like these shoes from ASICS for they just make my feet happy.
Asics,5,I like these sneakers a lot. They fit exceptionally well and are wonderful for hiking
Asics,5,"I like these sneakers but they run a little smaller than my usual size. They fit but there's no front toe room. Your big toe is right up against the shoe.
Recommend going up a 1/2 size."
Asics,5,I like these so much that this was a second purchase of the same thing. Arrived quickly.
Asics,5,I like these.  They fit perfectly.  They are very very blue!  They are great for walking (I don't run).
Asics,5,I like this product.
Asics,5,"I liked everything about the shoe.  I will get shoelaces that you do not have to tie, however, as I find
tying laces is not always comfortable; the laces slide behind the shoe tongue and are uncomfortable"
Asics,5,"I liked the fit, comfort and color of these shoes. I recommend these."
Asics,5,I liked the show so much I bought a second pair.
Asics,5,I liked the style the colors available and the way they fit. I have a high arch and they fit me very well.
Asics,5,i love  the brand  of Asics tennis shoes  they are the best pair  of  tennis shoes ever  there  mych  better the  nikie tennis shoes and sketchers and K - Swiss  tennis shoes and Adidas  tennis shows . they  fit  me great  .  I  just wanted  to  buy  a new pair  of  my  Asics tennis shoes for me  because my  old  paur  of them are worned out  and belong in the garbage  I am a 81/2  and they fit  me great
Asics,5,I love aciscs. They are so comfortable.
Asics,5,I love ASICS and these are so super comfortable
Asics,5,I love Asics and this shoe did not disappoint.
Asics,5,I love Asics because of their fit.  These are as comfortable as the others I own.  You can't beat the price for a decent tennis shoe.  I use mine for walking.
Asics,5,"I love Asics for the fit, comfort and stability. This has been good for my overpronation ( wearing a slight insert). Love the color too (it says black bur looks more like navy blue).
I work in a doctors office and am on my feet a lot. No back or knee problems wearing these."
Asics,5,I love ASICS running shoes & this is my 3rd or 4th pair (I lost count). Every year when I get a new pair I just go with the next generation & get the same fit/comfort as the one before. This pair is different in one way. The top air vents are amazing as I can feel the wind keeping my feet cool. Of course I live in a very windy area but never noticed this in previous pairs.
Asics,5,I love ASICS shoes. The fit and construction are top notch.  The style is classy - they look great with jeans or capris. Shipping was super fast. Thank you for this great product.
Asics,5,I love asics they are comfy when i exercise walk.
Asics,5,I love Asics usually and these live up to my expectations from this brand. They're incredibly comfortable and offer great rebound with each step. I find myself able to add additional miles to my usual walks because of the amazing comfort.
Asics,5,I love ASICS!  Have 6 pairs!  They are light and the fit is perfect!
Asics,5,I love ASICS!!
Asics,5,"I love ASICS,  excellent for walking and it supports my arch"
Asics,5,I LOVE ASICS. These shoes are comfortable. I usually wear a 9 but went with the 9.5 to give my toes room to slide in my shoes while walking/running. The arch is good
Asics,5,"I love ASICS. They fit true to size, great colors, and delivered quickly."
Asics,5,"I love Asics; however, it is very hard to find a sneaker in a wide width. These sneakers are very nice looking, exactly as described. They fit very comfortably. I am just starting to break them in. I love how they look and feel."
Asics,5,I love both pairs! The light blue feel as light as air and the black pair fits perfectly!
Asics,5,"I love everything about them, they are true in size and super comfortable."
Asics,5,I LOVE how comfortable these shoes are. I've tried other brands and even other ASICS models. This one fits well and has great support. The only thing I'm a little disappointed by are the shoelaces. They are very thin and I'm a little afraid they won't last as long as the shoe.
Asics,5,"I love it. It’s true to size, have a great support and grip."
Asics,5,I love my ASICS! I’ve tried other brands it these work the best for me.
Asics,5,"I love my Asics, however, this particular sneaker runs to small in length. I wear 8.5 wide always but I'm going to return for a 9 wide. Definitely size 2 sizes for extra room."
Asics,5,"I love my ASICS. I started walking several years ago, and could never find the right shoes. A friend of mine recommended this shoe brand and now it’s all I buy for walking. If I can’t find the ones I like in a wide width I go 1/2 a size up."
Asics,5,I love my ASICS. They are so comfortable and the width was perfect.
Asics,5,"I love my new Asics, very comfortable and nice colors."
Asics,5,I love my new ASICS.

Asics,5,I love my shoes
Asics,5,I love my shoes they fit perfect I the gel make them very comfortable no problem
Asics,5,"I love that the toe box is just right. I'm usually 7, but my feet are wider than normal. Love that they have wide options :) Very comfortable, and its so safe to walk on slippery surfaces and off terrain (sandy, rocks, mud)."
Asics,5,I love that these shoes aren't flimsy like all of the other tennis shoes out there right now. They are sturdy and have great support. I work in retail so i am on my feet all day and these saved my life!
Asics,5,I love that this running shoe comes in wide sizes. The wide fits perfect. Second pair I have bought.
Asics,5,I LOVE the Asics gel shoes!!!! They are so comfortable and long lasting.
Asics,5,I love the ASICS ventures. I owned Venture 6 before and worn them for years. Recently purchased these and they’re great! Comfortable and supportive from toe to heel. I highly recommend these no matter your level of exercise.
Asics,5,I love the colors in the shoes and I also like them because they are lightweight and not heavy on my feet.
Asics,5,I love the comfort these shoes give me. The support and style is great
Asics,5,I love the fit and support. The laces are very easy to tighten.
Asics,5,"I love the fit of these shoes. I don't usually wear a wide but I was looking for a shoe that had room for an arch support and had plenty of toe room.  I wear them as a walking shoe and they feel sturdy and comfortable.  The color says black/silver, but the shoes are actually a dark navy with a slight purplish/gray trim.  I saw the same shoes at DSW and all the boxes were also marked ""black/silver"", so it must be a misleading label from the manufacturer."
Asics,5,I love the fit. I wear them for work and they are extremely comfortable.
Asics,5,I love the gel sole Asics.  I buy a new pair every year and use my old ones for everyday.  I have problem feet and am sold on these shoes.
Asics,5,I love the look of these shoes. They meet my expectations as a walking shoe.
Asics,5,I love the price and the fit. No complaints here!
Asics,5,I love the shoe and it fits perfectly

Asics,5,I love the shoes.  This is my second pair
Asics,5,I love the sneakers I’ve been buying them for years
Asics,5,"I love the support it gives me in my heels.

Asics,5,I love these shoes! Feels like they were made for my feet.

Asics,5,I love these shoes! So comfy and love the colors!
Asics,5,"I love these shoes! Super comfy, makes being on my feet all day easier"
Asics,5,I love these shoes! they are very comfortable and i will probably order another pair later

Asics,5,"I LOVE these shoes!!!! I bought them for my trip to the Disney Parks, and we go from open to close, thus lots of walking. They were comfortable from the second that I tried them on. I love the color too! However, I bought a pair of the exact same shoes, but in a navy blue/black/purplish color, and they felt much more stiff, and actually quite hard under my feet. I will probably have to buy different inserts for that pair."
Asics,5,"I love these shoes, they are great for walking!  There is good support for the foot, they are long-lasting (had my previous ones more than 1 year of almost everyday wear) and they look cool!"
Asics,5,I love these shoes.  Fit well.  Very comfortable.  The only problem I have is that the laces come untied all the time.

Asics,5,I LOVE these shoes. So comfy and colors are bold and bright!!

Asics,5,"I love these sneakers so much! I have been working out and walking too, and my Nike sneakers hurt my feet after wearing too long. These sneakers we’re so comfortable that I just bought a second pair to leave at work and the other ones can stay home. I’m a 9 and the 9 fit perfectly. Not too narrow. Definitely recommend."
Asics,5,I love these sneakers! Perfect fit and comfortable.
Asics,5,I love these sneakers.  I feel like I'm walking on air.  True to size.

Asics,5,I love these sneakers. Perfect fit and very comfortable without needing to break them in.

Asics,5,I love these they are so comfortable!
Asics,5,I love these! And for the price these shoes are amazing! My ankles tend to supinate slightly and these are sturdy enough to keep my ankles stable when I run!

Asics,5,I love this running shoe
Asics,5,I love this series. They are absolutely phenomenal and feel amazing on my flat feet.
Asics,5,"I love this shoe brand as it really fits my narrow foot and it's comfortable. I haven't loved Asics designs recently, but I really like this one.  No breaking in period needed as it fit great off the bat."
Asics,5,I love this shoe. Fits perfect and is very comfortable. Such a great deal
Asics,5,"I love this shoe. It’s sometimes hard to find shoes for feet that supinate and have high arches. It was so helpful that the description included info for both of these conditions.
I was glad I ordered a wide. I am sometimes fine in a medium width, but more often I need a wide. This was just wide enough.
A minor but helpful point is that these cane with flat laces rather than the round so common now. These laces actually stay tied!
The color description said black and silver which agreed with my order details. But the shoes are actually navy blue with teal accents. I think I like this better. I noticed other reviews that mentioned their color was different, too.
The shoe is very comfortable and I’ve found that I can do a shopping session in them without tired and sore feet. I’m glad I ordered these."
Asics,5,"I love this shoes, and they fit great."
Asics,5,I love this sneakers
Asics,5,"I love those shoes they fit perfectly, very comfortable."
Asics,5,"I love walking in these shoes. Great support, comfortable and even soften the stress on my bunions. This is my second purchase of this brand."
Asics,5,I loved everything about them. They provided immediate comfort and relief for my messed up feet.
Asics,5,I loved it and so comfortable to wear
Asics,5,I loved the color
Asics,5,I loved the price. They are very comfortable.
Asics,5,"I LOVED them,  I had to return because they were a 1/2 size small.  But will definitely buy again soon!!!!"
Asics,5,"I luv these shoes, no need to break in"
Asics,5,I need a new work shoes for the hospital and they were absolutely perfect I love ASICS
Asics,5,"I need good shoes for my back and knees, and wear athletic shoes most of the time. These perform well, but also are discreetly styled."
Asics,5,I need to wear wide shoes which are hard to find. Finally found a pair that fits.
Asics,5,I needed a better shoe for stability.  Always wore sketchers before but these provide better support.
Asics,5,I needed a good shoe for running. It has not disappointed!
Asics,5,"I needed new running/walking shoes because my normal Nike shoes weren’t cutting it. I was having terrible shin splints and my legs would ache for days. After doing my research on how to find the best running shoe and learning about my over pronation, I found this shoe to be the best fit for me based on price and comfortability. I am also happy that these shoes also came with a wide option! I ordered a 9W and I love the fit. These shoes are so comfortable and my legs no longer are paining me (very mild pain if any). So happy with this purchase."
Asics,5,"I needed new shoes badly for work but didn't want all the flashy colors. I did some additional research as I tend to overpronate my right foot. The Asics Gel Venture shoes are perfect. I haven't had any issues with the shoes at all! I rotate between shoes to help my knees/feet, but these were comfy even two or three days' worth of shifts in a row. I wear a 7 and purchased a 7. I have a regular arch, and these were comfortable."
Asics,5,I needed new sneakers desperately and these fit the bill! Thank you so much!
Asics,5,"I needed some new shoes with good arch support, and read great reviews on these shoes. I love them! Great for walking, and were comfortable from the first time I put them on!"
Asics,5,"I needed to cross training shoes, but theyre all too soft in the base. I’m using resistance bands, so I need something with a firm sole! These are great for intensity, and are actually comfy!
I’ve gotten fitted at a running store and paid over 200 for some shoes that ended up hurting my feet. I’m one that wears flip flops (with support) with no feet problems. So for these shoes to not hurt my feet is great, an amazing find."
Asics,5,"I needed to find a shoe with a wider toe box. I usually wear a 9 1/2. I walk a lot for exercise and my feet swell, so I bought the 10 wide. They’re only 1/8” wider but feel much more comfortable."
Asics,5,"I never write reviews but this pair of sneakers fit perfectly and are very comfortable. I fluctuate between size 6.5 and 7 shoe size. But upon reading other reviews, I ordered 6.5 and bingo! Size 7 would have been a pinch too large for me. Love them, each step is very cushiony."
Asics,5,"I normally wear a size 10 1/2 in Nike, so I got these in the same size. I've never worn ASICS before today, and lemme tell ya, I'm so glad I decided to try them! They're super comfy and fit perfectly! The true test will be wearing them to work tomorrow. 🤞"
Asics,5,"I normally wear an 11N and always have difficulty finding shoes that fit.  The 11’s that I tried on at our local big box store were a tad too short, so I ordered an 11 1/2.  So glad I did.  Wearing them as golf shoes but looking forward to trying them on the trail."
Asics,5,I normally wear size 9 but needed to order 9 1/2. Love the quality though!
Asics,5,"I only by ASICS, I’ve tried other style but found this on is the best for me. So I just upgrade each year with the newest update."
Asics,5,I only recently learned athletic shoes should be purchased in a half size larger than your normal shoe size. I've been buying Asics for years and love them. Nice range of colors also.
Asics,5,I opted for these after returning another brand and  reading alot of reviews.  They are great for my flat feet and walking 8 hrs a day on concrete warehouse floors.  Nice color choices and the fit...7 1/2 was perfect
Asics,5,I order the same shoes all the time.  They are the only shoes I have found that are comfortable right out of the box.
Asics,5,I ordered a 10W and they fit perfect!
Asics,5,I ordered one pair to try them since my feet hurt all the time.  I was shocked they didn't hurt so I immediately ordered three more pair.  I am set for a few years now.
Asics,5,"I ordered several pairs of running shoes made by other manufacturers that I returned for bad fit and lack of comfort.  These Asics are amazing - comfortable, perfect fit, light weight and attractive!"
Asics,5,I ordered the black/silver and the box said Black/Silver but these are definitely Navy/Silver.  I am keeping them because they fit great and feel great.  Just FYI!  Nice support although they are light weight.  They fit well and true to size for me.  Nice cushioning and sole.  Love them in soite of the color not being what I expected.
Asics,5,I overpronate and my ankles turn in. These are good for shifting the pressure off the front of the foot. I am a nurse and I am on my feet all day.  These are good for ankle support and are narrower than the average shoe so i don't get slippage. Plenty of room at the front of the foot.  I have been wearing Asics for several years now. They are good if you have a narrower heel area. Also order them 1/2 shoe size larger than what I normally wear. Good support shoe.
Asics,5,I own 2 pairs of these!  Love them!! Use them for working out.  Supportive and comfortable!
Asics,5,I owned these shoes in the past and wore out the back of the shoe as I tend to do.  But it was such a comfortable shoe and had good support that I decided to order another. No need for insoles since the shoe seems to have all it needs.
Asics,5,I personally love these ASICS. I can get them to last at least 6 months and that is with running and walking lots of miles each week. My last pair survived more than 300 miles. They don't hurt my feet at all and I run in all terrains. They are especially great for running in the sand! I love these shoes soo much and would recommend to anyone!
Asics,5,I pretty much live in these shoes. They offer great support whether I’m running around or standing a lot.
Asics,5,I purchased a wide width and the gymshoes fit very good and I get alot of compliments on the colors.
Asics,5,"I purchased the wide 7.5 and they fit perfectly. I've purchased these shoes before and like them, then tried another style the Gel-Venture 6 Running-Shoes but they didn't feel as good as these. So I'm back to getting the Gel-Venture 7 Running Shoes. I prefer these over New Balance shoes any day."
Asics,5,"I purchased these after reading information on the best running shoes.  These are not #1, but in my mind should be.  I put them on and I could walk and run without any pronation in my right foot.  I can wear them all day without any issues.  Will be buying another pair as back up."
Asics,5,"I purchased these shoes for work. I typically wear Nursemates as I am on my feet 8+ hours a day. I have a wider foot, wear a size 8 which is what I ordered in regular width, and find it difficult to find shoes that I can wear on day 1 and feel comfortable in. These were perfect, no blisters no issues, decent non slip. I have been wearing them for a week and am very happy with my purchase"
Asics,5,I purchased these to replace my worn out sneakers. Great purchase. They’re very comfortable and look great as well.
Asics,5,"I rad an article and these were recommended for high arches. They really are made for those with high arches!! I am on the large size of a 9, not a 9 1/2. I ordered the 9 and they fit perfect!"
Asics,5,"I ran and had one day of blister on my right foot, which I expected. Then, they worked out great. I enjoy running in them."
Asics,5,"I realize every foot is different with different needs, I have high arches,  pronate to the outside with one painful bunion, wide width shoes are a must have for me, and ASICS Venture 7 meet all my needs."
Asics,5,I really enjoy the comfort and great fit of ASICS gel-venture 7 shoes.  I bought a 7.5 wide.
Asics,5,"I really like Asics shoes.  I have Plantar Fasciitis, and these are the only shoes that help with inserts."
Asics,5,I really like how comfortable these shoes are.
Asics,5,I really like the comfort and the size. I ordered wide and I'm very happy with them. The color is amazing with pink and gray.
Asics,5,I really like the insole that doesn’t have an arch because I wear orthotics under them.  Nice fit!
Asics,5,"I really like these shoes, they are so comfortable.  I've never been able to buy a pair of Asics that fit before.  They always used to seem small, but these are perfect!"
Asics,5,"I really like these sneakers! And I am super picky about sneakers. If you like less padding, these are not for you, but I have super high arches and I am amazed at how well these have formed to my feet.  Very comfortable!"
Asics,5,"I really like these. Im super picky about how my sneakers fit. Have to be pretty much perfect. Ill def be ordering a 2nd pair or 3 :) of these. Id like a pair for just inside.  The fit snug which I love.  I dont like my foot shifting in my shoes while working out. Great cushioning as well.  Now, I dont love the shoestrings, Ill probably be replacing them. They are super thin. Scares me a little, Since I like my shoes tied so tight.  Hard to tie with longer nails. Id still buy them again and Ill buy the sea-foam stripe next."
Asics,5,I really like this shoe and it is the second pair I've owned. The fit is just perfect.
Asics,5,I really liked the color combination! I also liked the easy lace ups!!!! Some shoes the laces are sooo hard to pull the laces through the holes! These are nice and wide and also lightweight! They’re comfortable to walk in and when just sitting they’re not too tight with my neuropathy. Shoe strings a bit short
Asics,5,I really love my shoes! Perfect fit! Exactly what I wanted!
Asics,5,I really love these shoes! I have paid much more for hiking shoes that didnt fit as well. these Asics are awesome.
Asics,5,"I really love these shoes, I was hesitant to buy sneakers online, I most prefer to try on and walk around. This was a gamble that paid off- they are super comfortable also when I am running it propels me forward- love that!"
Asics,5,I really love these shoes.  I got them for sturdiness but yet comfort and that's exactly what they are.  They are nice looking too. I plan on buying another color soon.  Thanks for a great shoe!
Asics,5,"I really needed a new pair of tennis shoes. These are so comfortable and fit well. Lots of support. Great price,  too"
Asics,5,I really satisfied with these sneakers. Comfortable and nice looking
Asics,5,"I received this order before the due date. Took out of box and wore them all day.  Then walked four miles on my treadmill with no issues.  Very light and comfortable with great support.  I bought the Graphite Grey/Black/Pink in size 8, it is true to the color and size. I am hoping they come out with a white colored pair but will buy another pair even they don't."
Asics,5,I recently started walking/jogging everyday ad wanted a good pair of shoes to wear.  I love these shoes. I  put them on and walked 4 miles.  I did not have to break them in and they are very comfortable.
Asics,5,I returned these ! The color was not Inexpected.
Asics,5,I sized up normally a 6 1/2 got a 7 fit just right so I recommend siding up in all a great running shoe
Asics,5,I spoke with my daughter and she said it fits perfect. Thank you
Asics,5,I started jogging not to long ago and these shoes have held up so far. They are very comfortable and seem durable!
Asics,5,"I started running regularly for the first time since high school, and a friend recommended these instead of the athleisure Nikes I had been waring. There as AWESOME. perfect price point if you need a solid running / walking shoe, but don't want to shell out $100+.

Update: Still holding up after 4+ months of weekly use!"
Asics,5,"I swear by ASICS. Seriously, ask anyone who knows me. If tennis shoes come up in conversation I go on and on about ASICS. These specific shoes are one of their cheapes options, and they’re still better for my feet than any Nike, Underarmour or Adidas."
Asics,5,"I teach K-1st Special Education Teacher, so I need comfort and support.  I am glad ASICS are working out for me! Always on my toes!"
Asics,5,"I tend to walk on the outside of my soles.  These shoes totally help with that.  Super comfy with GREAT support.  No more knee/ankle pain.  I put these on in the morning, and it's like a giant hug for my feet.  I love them so much I came back to buy another pair in a different color.  They accommodate a wide foot very well."
Asics,5,"I think these are my third or fourth pair of this model from Asics.  I don't use them for running, but because they're so comfy at work.  I'm on my feet and moving all day, and I have feet that are right on the border where a lot of shoes are too tight, but wide widths are often a smidge too wide.  These just hit the right mark for me.  I switch out to a new pair about every six months for work. They last longer than that, and I keep them for non-work use, but that's usually around the point where I want a new pair for all day wear.

Another thing I like about them is that although they're not waterproof, they do dry out pretty quickly if I get them wet."
Asics,5,"I thought these shoes would be a little bulky, but they look great and fit perfectly! The bottoms have a good grip and even provide stableness in the snow. Good for any type of walking"
Asics,5,I took a chance and ordered shoes online. These fit great and so comfortable!
Asics,5,"I tried a much more expensive sneaker that was touted as one of the best for metatarsalgia but the Asics Gel-Venture 7 felt better and provided more support.  Very happy with these sneakers, use them for weight lifting, walking, pickleball."
Asics,5,"I typically do not buy shoes without trying them on, but this last year has been all BUT typical, so why not? VERY PLEASED. I like the color (dark and subtle), fit (I have a moderately wide foot), laces (Rayon braided), feel (light and solid) everything! great price too - I thought I'd be paying almost twice this amount in a store like kohls or other department stores. Will recommend and will most likely purchase again in an additional color."
Asics,5,I use ASICS as my main running/workout shoe due to the arch support. I’ll keep ordering it.
Asics,5,"I use these asics to walk 10,000 every day!!"
Asics,5,I use these for all workouts. They look and feel great!
Asics,5,"I use these shoes on the treadmill, love the colors and great support"
Asics,5,I use this shoe for walking 3 to 4 miles 4 times a week.  It provides excellent with the right amount of cushioning.  My size is normally a 9 or 9.5 depending on the amount of space in the toebox.  I originally ordered a size 10 but returned these for a size 9.5.  The 9.5 works perfectly and gives me enough space for my socks. I will probably order another pair in a different color.
Asics,5,I use this shoes for walking and I love them
Asics,5,I used to always buy New Balance sneakers but this time i thought I'd try Asics.  So glad I did.  These sneakers are soooo comfortable.  Each step is like walking on a sponge.
Asics,5,I used to do exercises and they have good support and are super comfortable. Love them
Asics,5,I usually buy another brand but decided to make a change and try these and was very pleased. They are a good fit and very comfortable. Bought two more pairs.
Asics,5,I usually wear  size 11 but went to a 11.5 for more room in toe this time happy I did
Asics,5,I usually wear 8.5 but got an 8. So far fits petfect. Initially everything is great! Hope they last!
Asics,5,"I usually wear a 6.5 in brooks and sketchers.  but this shoe is not fitting the same. Otherwise it’s good shoe.
Ok update review. Re ordered and went half size up. And omg so much better. Def not same sizing as my brooks or sketchers. Have go half size up in these. But wearing em today for work in school and they are wonderful. So glad I re tried em. Got the charcole grey /pink ones this time."
Asics,5,I usually wear this to hike. They provide good traction and grip. Sizing is accurate.
Asics,5,I walk alot at work. So these are perfect 👌.
Asics,5,I walk daily to stay fit and these shoes help me do that.  Very comfortable!  No issues!
Asics,5,"I walk daily upwards of 5mi a day. I put these on and went on the normal trail. Gel soles are really helping with overall impact from the trail and I had no blistering from first wear!  Best purchase, highly recommend."
Asics,5,"I walk/hike about 60 miles a week and these Asics are super supportive. I have high arch and these shoes are comfy and keep my feet feeling good. I've tried other brands, but I stay injury free with Asics. They have a supportive arch and good tread for trails. They look great too. I like the subtle colors too."
Asics,5,"I wanted a pair of shoes that I could wear for everything, not just running.  These shoes are so comfortable and I am very happy with this purchase"
Asics,5,I was able wear these shoes immediately for  a 3 mile hike. They continue to be very comfortable and they look great!
Asics,5,"I was anxious to buy tennis shoes online but these are great! I love the color and fit is perfect. They are more sturdy than my previous tennis shoes, which I needed. They give lots of support around the ankle, but don't feel too tight. I love the bottom tread because rocks and stuff don't get stuck in them. Great for walking on trails or hiking."
Asics,5,"I was drawn to these for the price. I recently bought a $30 pair of running shoes and my feet hurt in them so I needed another pair. I went for these ASICS because of the brand's reputation. These Venture 7s are great, my feet don't hurt and they feel supported when I run. I haven't run further than 5 miles in them, so I can't speak for real long distance running, but I like them for a couple of miles here and there. I'm 5'3 130 and typically run an 8 min pace, hope this helps!"
Asics,5,I was having a hard time finding trail running shoes in the store. So I decided to buy these online. They fit perfectly and are great for trail runs!
Asics,5,I was introduced to these shoes by a Dillards sales person.... Have bought them ever since...... They are wonderful. I have had many pairs.... I believe in spending money on shoes to get the last and comfort.  I order online ... Dillard's no longer sells them....
Asics,5,"I was looking for a decent pair of trail shoes, and these are perfect. I have a previous ankle injury that makes finding comfortable shoes difficult for me, I’ve been having to spend a lot of money on really good quality and supportive shoes. These are very affordable, and cause me no ankle pain after walking around in them, which is unusual for me! They were exactly as pictured and fit me perfectly. I will definitely buy them again once I wear these ones out!"
Asics,5,I was looking for good outdoor running shoes and indoor training - these are PERFECT and very very comfortable.
Asics,5,"I was pleasantly surprised to receive these.  The color is great, and I love the shoe laces.  The round ones never stay tied on me, and they are not so long that they will be flopping around.  The heel is a little loose on me, but I'll try to remember to wear thicker socks.  I also wear Narrow shoes but knowingly ordered the medium.  So far, so good.  I'll try to update if things change."
Asics,5,"I was pleased and surprised that this shoe fit. I had ordered another brand of running shoes from Amazon and unfortunately had to return that pair since they were not comfortable.
Decided to try again, and ordered these based on positive reviews.  I have worn them several times and am very satisfied!"
Asics,5,"I was prescribed Asics running shoes by my podiatrist when I developed foot problems.  I purchased my first pair at a running supply store, but have ordered subsequent pairs online from Amazon because I can always depend on them to fit perfectly and look great.  Truly a great product that is true to size."
Asics,5,I was replacing a previously owned pair of Gel6. I am pleased to say these fit the same and are just as comfortable.
Asics,5,I was shocked to find women’s sneakers in large sizes and wide width. I like them. They are comfortable and wear well. Very light weight and great for the road or the gym.
Asics,5,I was somewhat apprehensive about  purchasing running shoes on line but didn’t want to risk on-site shopping as I am not yet eligible for the Covid vaccine. I purchased the shoes in a size 9 as I do all my running/walking  shoes despite wearing an 8.5 in regular shoes. They fix wonderfully. I have now walked miles in the shoes ant they provide excellent support.
Asics,5,"I was totally pleased with these shoes.  They fit well, support me well, and are comfortable for walking.
The price is very reasonable, and the quality great.  No problems with these shoes!"
Asics,5,"I was wearing, for many months, another brand tennis shoes because of its ""memory foam,"" turns out, that was the worst thing I was doing to my flat feet. I developed metatarsal, which created an unbalance in my body, and needless to say, I ended up at the podiatrist's office. Under his advice, the advice of a fellow RN friend (and her podiatrist), I bought my Asics (which I used to wear long ago). OMG!!! what a difference! It hasn't cured my metatarsal off course, but what I great relief!! I can even stick shift when driving and not feel hot needles in my foot.
I love my Asics and will never buy another brand again. They support my feet and there's no price to that."
Asics,5,I wear 8.5 in Nike and New Balance and I ordered 8.5 in this shoe. Fit is perfect.  Cute shoe. Toe  is more rounded and not so pointed and I like that particular look.
Asics,5,"I wear a size 11 and it is very hard to find those when shopping in person. Once I find a shoe I like, I keep ordering it via online (until it's no longer available.)  Asics is one of the few size 11 that is large enough to fit. Most other brands (Nike, Adidas, LL Bean to name a few) do NOT fit me. So if you have big feet like me, try this brand!"
Asics,5,"I wear a women's size 10 and these fit comfortably. I have wore them for two ten hour warehouse shifts and my feet feel fine. The shoes are a foam type, something I am unaccustomed to."
Asics,5,I wear an 8 and 1/2 shoe. This size was much too small. I am in the process of getting a refund now.
Asics,5,I wear an 8.5 and find these shoes to be plenty roomy for hiking and running. I’ve owned multiple pairs of these shoes and will buy them again. Great value.
Asics,5,"I wear asics for work, they're really comfortable!"
Asics,5,I wear ASICS sneakers everyday in my job. These are the best! They run usually 1 size too small... so order up! Great support and cushion!
Asics,5,"I wear size 5.5 but sometimes it is a bit small so I am never sure.  This time 5.5 fits perfectly.  The size chart though is erroneous.  Instead of 22.5 cm it says 22.5 inches and 57.5 cm that cannot be a human foot size.  The sneakers are beautiful, very light and comfy.  Glad I ordered!"
Asics,5,"I wear this everyday for 12 hour shifts and its noticeable my feet are not swollen, achy and tired. I plan to buy a pair or two more before the stock is out."
Asics,5,"I were a 9 but with these I ordered in a 91/2 and the fit is great with the rounder toe the fit is better then I thought.
  Up Date I love these shoes so much that I have bought me  another pair."
Asics,5,I wish I could get this shoe in white
Asics,5,"I wore these to my first day of physical therapy after arthroscopic knee surgery & my therapist told me Asics were the best shoes to wear because they’re so stable. She was actually wearing a pair. Later, when I was at the Orthopedist, he said “glad to see you’re wearing the right shoes”.
Seriously, nobody told me to buy these shoes, and given their reaction, I’m kind of surprised.
I bought these shoes because they were highly rated for those with high arches & I must agree because they truly are very comfortable! I have no foot pain whatsoever when I’m wearing these shoes. Great shoes!"
Asics,5,"I work 10hr days in a retail setting, have plantar fasciitis, and heel spurs in both feet. These sneaks are amazing! I use to be a Nike girl but I wear a size 11 women's and have wide feet. I turned on to ASICS last year and haven't looked back. I have to wear business actual so I'm loving the mostly black with pop of gold and maroon 👌"
Asics,5,"I work at a vet clinic, and I'm on my feet all day. The shoes I've tried before have all left my feet in serious pain by the end of the day.
 I wore these shoes all week and never had foot pain! They are super comfortable, run true to size, breathable, and look great! The only negative is how thin the laces are. I can't imagine them being super durable, but I may be wrong."
Asics,5,I work for Amazon and I am on my feet 10 hours day and these are great shoes. Very comfortable and the gel inside is amazing
Asics,5,I work in a busy ER and have worn this brand for 14 years.  I had severe back pain before I first started wearing Asics and they helped tremendously.
Asics,5,"I work in a hospital - had to give up my pretty dress shoes for comfy sneakers thanks to the pandemic. And I don’t know if I can ever go back to dress shoes again anymore. These sneakers are IT. In fact, I am buying myself another pair."
Asics,5,"I work in a warehouse, concrete floors and on my feet all day. I used to be a dancer and had great arches but after 8 years in a warehouse walking on these floors my arches fell a bit. This game with foot pain that had me limping by the end of my shift. These shoes have saved me from that pain. So glad I decided to try them."
Asics,5,I work long hours as a nurse they are comfortable for long hours!!!!
Asics,5,"I work on cement floors for over eight hours a day, I need good support and not to pricey because I change them out every 3-4 months!"
Asics,5,I work on my feet all day and then I have to walk a mile to my car (not joking). These keep me bouncing through my day and I don't feel fatigued at the end.
Asics,5,I would like a replacement but I don’t see the option. I wore them 4 times indoors only (on my treadmill) and they now have a slit in the sole.
Asics,5,"I’m a huge fan of ASICS!! They always fit, wear well & serve my needs well/$$$ is great too"
Asics,5,"I’m a nurse on my feet, speed walking 12+ hours a day and am on my third pair of these shoes. Super comfortable (and they hold up well after going in the washing machine)."
Asics,5,"I’m a size 10 but took 10.5 and I’m happy I did.
Fits like a glove, light weight and very soft inside."
Asics,5,I’m loving everything about them!🤗
Asics,5,I’m on my feet all day! These are amazing! Fit is true to size!
Asics,5,I’m so excited I got them. Not sure when they can as I found them in between my storm door and house door!! I always come in threw my garage. But I love the color and I tried them on. Perfect fit!! I wear a size woman’s 12.
Asics,5,"I’m so glad I got these! The shoes I was wearing to walk in daily were rubbing blisters into the bottom of my feet. I looked through so many shoes and decided on these. I bought these because they were the top choice for Asics, really, but I’ve had ASICS before and remember them being very comfortable. I walk 3-4 miles a day for exercise and these are perfect. I had a wide food so I got the W and went up a half size. My foot has plenty of space inside the shoe but it also feels secure and doesn’t rub on my feet in any spot. They could use a little more support but still, I like it."
Asics,5,"I’m usually a size 10, but need an 11 with ASICS. This is such a fun sneaker with great colors. I always get compliments. They are my favorite brand because of fit and shock absorption."
Asics,5,I’ve always been a fan of ASICS. Some more than others. My feet are always in pain. I’ve worked my entire life in retail on hard floors. I have a really bad case of plantar fasciitis. These are super comfy. I haven’t even switched over to my insoles yet. I’m a fan of trail running shoes because of the placement of cushion and they don’t flex easily. Good traction for all surfaces.
Asics,5,I’ve been purchasing ASICS for several years now and I’ve always been pleased with the product. This shoe is what I expected at a good price.
Asics,5,I’ve been running for many years and have always enjoyed ASICS. I’ve also learned that there shouldn’t be much “breaking in period” for a well made and well fitting NEW running shoe; they should automatically feel comfortable like you can go run in them. These are that way. Just finished a 5k distance first run in these shoes. ASICS never disappoints! Happy I ordered two pairs in different colors!! 💯❤️👍🏼👍🏼
Asics,5,I’ve been wearing ASICS for a while so I know what size I wear. These fit as expected and are just as comfortable as I am used to.
Asics,5,I’ve been wearing ASICS for years and love their comfort.  I like the color of these.
Asics,5,"I’ve been wearing New Balance shoes for years to give my overpronating feet the support they need, but New Balance must have redesigned the lasts and they no longer fit my feet. I’ve ordered and returned several pairs of shoes that either didn’t fit, didn’t support my feet or were just darn UGLY!  These are great for me.  I replaced the insole with my orthotics and they have the support I need.  I love the gray color. The shoes are neutral, but not boring, old lady shoes.  Next time I need shoes, I’ll go straight to the ASICS page."
Asics,5,I’ve never been disappointed with the quality or wear of these shoes!
Asics,5,"I’ve never ordered running shoes sight unseen, but I needed a new pair. These are the most comfortable running shoes I’ve ever had so far. They’re super lightweight, but substantial in the instep and heel."
Asics,5,"I’ve never owned ASICS shoes before so this would a first for me. Ever since I had my son my feet are now wide (common to happen after pregnancy, especially Japanese women) I always have a hard time finding sneakers that I like and fit.  So far I find these shoes comfortable and secure. I only have used them for working out at the gym and to to go on long walks. I jog and run on the treadmill and they feel great for me. Not too tight since I bought a size 8 wide in women’s.  They are holding up nicely and I have had them for about a month now."
Asics,5,I’ve tried all different brands of running shoes and these are by far my favorite. I can wear them all day and on long walks/runs/HIIT workouts and they are always always always comfortable. Will never bother with a different pair of sneakers again.
Asics,5,I’ve tried several brands and these have the best support.
Asics,5,"If you have foot conditions such as Plantar Fascitis, fallen arches, or a removed toenail, (need wider toed-shoes because toe is more sensitive w/out toenail) And also need to be on your feet a lot, to boot, these are great.  Cushioning, comfort is all good, for me, anyway."
Asics,5,If you have wore this brand before and you like them...its a safe buy. They feel great out of the box and I still wear the old ones. Which are 6-7 years old.
Asics,5,"I'm a huge fan of Asics.  They're actually the only sneaker I wear these days.  I'm a classic 7.5 size in this brand so I never have a problem ordering online.  I was pleasantly surprised by this ""Ortholite"" running shoe.  The cushion is amazing and it feels like I'm walking on clouds.  I'm in love."
Asics,5,"I'm a supinator who suffers from peroneal tendonitis (I thought it was plantar fasciitis but I was wrong, and I was treating it wrong which made it worse), and Asics Gel-Venture 7 are the only shoes I can walk in without pain.  Color choices aren't as cute as other Asics, like my favorites the Gel-Excite 4, but I'll go back to those after my tendonitis is healed.  At least the navy is nice, but until they fix the typo you have to order black to get navy!!!  (Just FYI: You might also be a supinator if you look at your shoes from the back and the outer heels are worn down more than anywhere else on the shoe.  If the inner heels are worn down more, then you might be a pronator; if the heels are worn down uniformly then you're probably neutral.)"
Asics,5,"I'm a walker and hiker. Unfortunately, the toe guard peeled after about six months on the first pair I bought. I'm hoping that issue's been resolved because these shoes are mega comfortable and last a long time. I made two orders (diff colors) this time so as not to wear them out so fast."
Asics,5,"Im a walker, not a runner but I'm happy to report that these Asics were comfortable and supportive from day one."
Asics,5,"I'm an athlete and need lots of foot support. They fit my wide feet perfectly, and I feel like I'm walking on air. Will so buy again!"
Asics,5,"I'm giving 5 stars because these were really comfortable and looked great.  However, I noticed after I tried them on that my big toes would poke through. My feet turn out and my toes press up. These did not have the extra bit of rubber over the toe as the previous versions did. My last pair was the Gel-Venture 5's, and they were comfortable for a few years before the heels went flat (and I wore them alot). I ended up returning these and getting the Gel-Venture 6, which have the extra toe coverage."
Asics,5,I'm love this.
Asics,5,I'm on my feet all day and these shoes are super comfortable and love they sort of grip to the floor as I need that too!
Asics,5,I'm on my feet for 12 hours or more. These shoes are great. They really help my back. My feet does not hurt by the end of the day. Thank you.
Asics,5,"Im usually hesitant to purchase running shoes online, but I am so glad I went for it with these. This is my first pair of ASICS and I absolutely love them. I sized up a half size.. which I typically do in most running shoes. I ran in these twice on the treadmill to try them out and they are very comfortable and easy to run in. I don’t think I’d prefer them as a racing shoe but wow they are great trainers.  They are very well made and said to be a trail shoe so they will hold up for many miles. If you’re looking for a great trainer give these a try."
Asics,5,"I'm very happy with these shoes. I have arch and ankle problems.  These shoes are comfortable, attractive, and gives me stability."
Asics,5,Incredibly comfortable I would buy this over and over again. I wish I could wear these to work I would wear them 24 seven if I could.
Asics,5,"Iove these shoes very  good fit,quality great arch support.  I would definitely buy again."
Asics,5,Ir's hard to find shoes that are comfortable all day..loved my first pair and bought 2 more...I hate getting osmething I like and not be able to find them again
Asics,5,Is good
Asics,5,It feels comfortable
Asics,5,It fit perfect and true to size for me. I had instant heel relief after putting these on where as my old shoes did not give enough support. Would order again once I run these into the ground. 😁
Asics,5,It fit so comfortably and easy to walk in them.
Asics,5,It fits as expected.
Asics,5,it fits perfect
Asics,5,"It fits perfect, don’t pinch toes"
Asics,5,It fits perfectly and I wear an 8.5. That’s what I ordered no issues and doesn’t rub my ankles
Asics,5,It fits perfectly and is very comfortable best buy in sneakers ever.
Asics,5,It fits perfectly thank you.
Asics,5,It fits true to my size and thre is no pain from impact to my feet.
Asics,5,"It got here way faster than expected which is awesome, nice fit, easy to put on easy to take off."
Asics,5,It is a good product.
Asics,5,It is amazing fit and comfort cannot take them off. They are perfect for walking and standing long hours ... great buy
Asics,5,"it is as expected. The fit is what you get , just measure your feet. For guide I am 7 UK, EU 40 , US 8 -8 1/2 .  I ordered a 9 medium. Knowing the company is asian. It is just as seen too on the pic. I FOUND A NEW SELLER I AM KEEPING."
Asics,5,It is really good
Asics,5,"It is so hard to find a women's shoe in size 11.5, so I was happy to find these. Very comfortable and not tight in the toes."
Asics,5,"It is very comfortable, I recommend it 100%"
Asics,5,"It is very hard for me to find a style and comfort all in one shoe.  However, since my first pair of Asics last year I was sold!  I was so pleased with the color, and i literally slid out of old shoes into these and the comfort was just perfect!"
Asics,5,It looks great and also so comfortable. Just be careful about getting half size larger.
Asics,5,It says black and silver but looks more navy and purple. But that doesn't matter. I love asics these especially. They are the most comfortable sneakers ever.
Asics,5,It was exactly as I expected.  Great comfort.
Asics,5,It was just like in the store
Asics,5,"It was time to replace my Asics 7 Excite (500 miles) so I ordered the Venture7.  They picked up right where my others left off.  No break in required, quite comfortable and a pleasure to walk in."
Asics,5,It was true to size and very comfortable to wear!
Asics,5,It wasn’t as wide as I expected but super cute.
Asics,5,It’s comfortable and fits perfectly
Asics,5,It’s fit me perfect
Asics,5,It’s so comfy!
Asics,5,"It's a good shoe. Shipping was fast. Nothing wrong with quality. I just learned a lesson about wide shoe sizing.  The platform on wide running shoes are not wider than regular shoes. Only the upper has extra material to allow room for a thicker foot (I guess). My feet are only a little bit wide. They hang off the sides of regular width shoes just a bit so I was trying to get shoes that had a wider platform. Apparently a double wide shoe is needed for a larger platform, but you also get twice the extra material on the upper with a double wide shoe. My feet aren't thick or chubby, just a bit wide, sides of my feet will still hang off platform in wide shoe, feet will be swimming in double wide :("
Asics,5,"It's a great pair of shoes. I bought them at the same time as I bought a pair of Brooks Ghost 13s and honestly I love them both, so I think that really speaks to the high quality of both pairs. They fit well and I have my orthotics in them. Very happy with my purchase."
Asics,5,It's a great shoe.
Asics,5,It's a very comfortable shoe and looks great.
Asics,5,Its amazing like it says RUNNING shoes it help you get on the go
Asics,5,Its better than in the picture i use for running and work
Asics,5,"It's difficult to find the right  comfortable shoes for my wife's feet. She loves the fit, color and style."
Asics,5,"It's so nice to find a wide in my size.  These fit perfectly.  I have a very high arch!
The colors are black mesh/black Asics swoosh, navy blue leather accents, teal ties, and polka dot laces.
These are comfy right out of the box! Enjoy!"
Asics,5,"I've always like Asics, but hadn't purchased them for a few years trying to save money.  Spend the money.  The most comfortable walking/running shoe for me.  Fun to wear, too, with their new colors and styles."
Asics,5,"I've been a runner since I was 19, when there were no special shoes for the purpose.  I've run literally all over the world as I worked in many places.  Here are a few:  Greenland, South Africa, Cambodia, Switzerland.  I now walk/run every day when I take out my  four legged nephew, a 100 pound Swiss shepherd.  I simply run three four times a week when he's with his papa.  I hate waste, so I usually get new shoes only once every two years.  This brand is great for my arches and way of running.  I am delighted to have a new pair!"
Asics,5,I've been an ASICS fan for a while. I had to break them in as they say. Very comfortable for running and walking nature trails and every day use.
Asics,5,I've been wearing Asics for a while.  These are the best so far. They run small I had to go up one full size from my shoe size. There's a lot of room in the toe area and a lot of support. I highly recommend.
Asics,5,I've been wearing Asics running shoes for many years and it is great.  I have high arch feet so this brand provides great support and very comfortable running shoes.
Asics,5,"I've been wearing Asics shoes for the past 14 years, and I love them. Every time mine wear out, I get a new pair. They are comfortable, hold up well, the sizing hasn't changed, and I love the color selections!"
Asics,5,"I've bought brooks for years and recently they haven't been working for long walks or long hikes. I've needed more padding and wider options. I friend recommended these and I have to say, they are so much better than any brooks I've had. Cheaper too. I don't know why but I had low expectations for them and they blew me away. They are wide, have great traction, look great, have lots of padding and overall solid shoe. I can't speak on the longevity but so far so good."
Asics,5,"Ive Bought my wife 10 Different pair of Hundred-Dollar Running shoes for work, and This^ is the ONLY pair she wears ...

says its the ONLY pair that fit her feet...
she says she hasa WIDE Foot .."
Asics,5,"I've had problems with metatarsalgia, plantar fasciitis and hip pain from osteoarthritis.  I ordered my first pair of these when having a flare of the metatarsalgia after reading they were good for that.  It is much better and so is my hip.  Maybe it's correlation and not causation, but I ordered a spare pair while they're available because the correlation is very strong!  Also, attractive and comfortable and the price is way less than what I'm used to paying for running shoes."
Asics,5,"I've had surgery on one foot, so one fits perfectly while the left shoe is uncomfortable."
Asics,5,I've had these shoes for a couple months now and love them. I owned Asics gel venture 5 before these sneakers and they fit just as comfortably. Love the color too!
Asics,5,"I've lost count of how many pairs of Asics Gel running shoes I've had.  They always fit well (I wear 8.5 in regular shoes, but always buy size 9 in running shoes), they're comfortable and supportive (I have somewhat flat feet), and they play well with my bunions."
Asics,5,"I've never tried this brand of shoe, I am a distance walker when I find good shoes. I have plantar fasciitis, I have bone spurs in both heels.
I am a 50 years young women and I slipped these an out the door I went for a short quick 3.5 mile walk, let me tell you  I could of went another 3 miles but had an appointment to get to, and no blisters, no slipping, just as if they had been made just for my feet. I will order another pair next week so I have have a back up pair and keep them in my closet.  Thanks for all the great reviews I read on them."
Asics,5,I've started to get more active and noticed my sneakers leaving my feet and legs hurting. I ordered these after a friend suggested the brand for a great running shoe. I've been using them about a week and have put about 30 miles on them with zero pain. Very good purchase! I plan to order more in different colors as I add to my workout wardrobe.
Asics,5,"I've tried many different shoes, Ive got low arches and arthritis in my ankles. I love these shoes. My feet dont hurt at the end of a workout. They have great traction for trails and slimmy bike paths. Tons of room in toe box. Also great cushioning for hard roads."
Asics,5,"I've worn ASICs for several years now, and this pair was comfortable on the first day, as expected. I've worn them for a week so far, with my orthodic insert under the shoe's regular sole insert. My only complaint is that ASICs doesn't consider the width of orthopedic inserts when they make their regular insole in narrow in the heel. As a result, my orthodic sticks out without any cushioning along the inside of my foot. So far, my orthodic hasn't cut into my foot and I don't have any squeaking that I've had with other ASICs that I've place my orthodic into.  The shoelaces seem a bit cheaply made, not as heavy duty as other ASICs I've gotten. Overall, a very nice shoe with a stylish look. I have the black and gray color."
Asics,5,Just as expected from ASICS; perfect.  Fits to size.  Very light.  Extremely comfortable.  Easy to put on and lace up.
Asics,5,Just as expected perfect
Asics,5,"Just breaking them in, but walk 3 miles/day usually and they are very comfy!  The mesh isn’t so open your feet get cold either!"

Asics,5,"Let me start by saying I would not ordinarily buy footwear on the internet. There are too many variables to take into consideration. That being said, I found an excellent shoe shopping in a brick and mortar store and looked to get a new pair when my first pair wore out. I chose a shoe that was almost identical to the ones I had. They arrived extremely quickly and were perfect. I love them."

I do use chemical in my job and it being winter where I live they have got so fabric discoloring and soft damage. I'm still very surprise how durable they are though. Still have ALOT of tread and have so much life left into them. Certainly will be purchasing again when I need a new pair or just want an extra one."
Asics,5,Love these. I went on a whim and asked for these for my bday and sent the link to my bf. They fit as expected. I'm a 7 and the 7 fits perfectly. They are comfy and supportive. I hate anything cheap or shoes that hurt..these are 100% great.

Asics,5,"Love theses. My inserts made for my other ASICS fit perfectly.. immediately comfortable after first wear. Comfortable and light walking shoe, inserts are helpful. ASICS run about a size small just FYI if you get your own orthododics  take out regular insert and order 1 size up., having all black walking/ running shoes is also a nice change from some of the obnoxious other wild color combinations especially in the ASICS line."

Asics,5,"LOVE THIS!!!!! For my part time job I need black shoes and sadly my old shoes by this brand from 2012 finally died on me because  the holes in the side got to big- one thing I was looking for in new shoes were great traction on wet floor and these shoes covered that for me. Another thing I was looking into when buying was the bottom of the shoes, I was looking for shoes with great tread similar to my old shoes buy this brand. Cannot wait to see how long these shoes last do to me being a toe runner/walker!"
Asics,5,Love!
Asics,5,"Love, love, love these shoes !
They felt fantastic from the minute that I put them on.  I am going to order a second pair in another color, because they are just that great."
Asics,5,"Loved that they were lightweight and had a variety of lacing possibilities.
I had to work rather intensely to accommodate my high arches and instep. But managed to get them to work. by adding more arch support. They are perfect for work and  rather professional looking."

Asics,5,"My ASICS were exactly as pictured!! They are true to size, super light-weight and just perfect! They arrived a bit late, but I was always sent messages notifying me of the delay. Excellent service!!! Thank you!!!"
Asics,5,"My Asics Women's Gel-venture 7 Running Shoes are the best shoes when you are on your feet in Healthcare like me. I brought the Pink and Gray pain almost 2.5 years ago and I love them. I love them so much I brought the same pair 2 weeks ago and now I am getting the Black and Gray pair🤗🏆☄🥇☄. I would recommend this Brand for anyone who is on there feet 10-12  hours like me. The are more than worth the Price. I am a believer in ""Asics brand"""
Asics,5,My daughter loved the look and fit
Asics,5,My daughter loved these.
Asics,5,"My daughter needed them for volleyball... we bought 2 pairs ... just love these shoes!
Better prices than brick and mortar stores !"
Asics,5,My daughter really likes them.
Asics,5,My daughter said they fit perfect and excellent for running in winter conditions.
Asics,5,My daughter uses these shoes as her distance shoes for track and cross country.  She loves them. She says they are comfortable and supportive.
Asics,5,My fast walking shoe! Fits great and feels good too.
Asics,5,My favorite shoes
Asics,5,My favorite shoes. Great support and durability.  I have two pairs because they are awesome.
Asics,5,My favorite sneaker.. this is my 3rd pair. love these better than Nike and Addis shoes.
Asics,5,My favorite was the Venture 6. The Venture 7 is now my favorite. When hiking they don't slip like my others did. Because of a smal footl I struggle finding a shoe that fits. All of my ASICS fit perfectly. The arch support is where it is supposed to be and supports my foot well.
Asics,5,My feet and knees are so happy! If I had the money I’d buy 100 more pair!  Just instantly noticed the difference.  I bought the 7.5 wide.  Not sure my feet are all that wide but the shoe is definitely more comfortable as a wide.
Asics,5,My feet are happy in these shoes! Made well. Fit perfectly. Nikes are too narrow on my feet.
Asics,5,My feet do not hurt after wearing these shoes for a long time. I love them! Best sneakers I've ever owned!
Asics,5,My feet feel so good when I walk.
Asics,5,"My feet have apparently gotten bigger as I’ve gotten older so my old shoes were simply too small with my toes smashed up against the front of my sneakers.  Plus, I recently got an elliptical machine and have discovered that I need more room in the width for my feet to splay out properly as I use the machine. So, a larger shoe size and “wide” width solved those issues for me. This particular sneaker has proven excellent for use on an elliptical machine."
Asics,5,"My foam bottom sneakers were giving the ultimate pain to the point I had swollen legs.
Dr recommended this brand for support
Pain is all gone now... they are very comfortable"
Asics,5,my foot doctor recommended them
Asics,5,My foot doctor recommended them to help with my heal pain
Asics,5,My girlfriend loves him and says they are very comfortable
Asics,5,My granddaughters love it but it doesn't fit
Asics,5,My heel stopped hurting once I started wearing this shoe
Asics,5,"My husband has been dragging me hiking more and more, and my normal running shoes simply can't cut it anymore.  I didn't want $100 sandals and I'm not ready for clunky, heavy hiking boots, so these shoes seemed like a perfect compromise.  I wear Asics tennis shoes almost exclusively because they have a pretty wide selection of models that work for my supination (I walk on the outside of my foot, it's awful, 0/10 would not recommend).  These shoes have fully cemented my brand loyalty.  Wore them on a 10 mile trek over rocks and creeks and they performed beautifully.  I have arthritis, too, so falling is one of my greatest fears.  The traction kept me upright and supported on a number of muddy slopes."
Asics,5,My husband wears ASICS shoes and said I should get a pair. I am so glad that I took his advise because these are so very confortable.
Asics,5,"My last pair of ASICS finally kicked the bucket after 12+ years of wear. Happy to have purchased these as a replacement. Decent/fair price, free shipping and fast delivery. Color and style exactly as pictured. Fits true to size as well. I expect to get the same mileage I got from my last pair."
Asics,5,"My left foot has a little more of an arch, but my right foot is flat, has stronger plantar fasciitis, and my ankle and right knee have issues. These shoes are amazing! I tried the venture gel 5 ASICS and the left foot was fine, but the right foot on the inside middle area hurt a lot when I wore them. So I had to return those, for me these shoes worked out great. If you have a higher arch I would go with the 5. It would probably help even better if you had an insert. I do have to say that the toe area was a little smaller than usual, but after wearing them for 9 plus hours I felt like they stretched out a bit and didn’t irritate my toes. I bought an 11.5 wide.
One last thing, I didn’t realize how noticeable I would see the orange and since orange isn’t my favorite color I wasn’t crazy about that, but since the main colors are the blue and black colors, I got over that detail. So either like orange or get over the fact that there might be more orange color in it then you are expecting."
Asics,5,"My new Asics Gel Venture 6 shoes arrived yesterday. Size 8, wide They fit perfectly.  I love the colors. Mine were the black/silver (actually navy blue) with the Ortholite padding. I adore Asics shoes, but the colors can be kinda garish sometimes. These are perfect."
Asics,5,My new Fave Shoe!!!!
Asics,5,My new favorite shoe.. perfect fit.
Asics,5,"My previous trail running shoes were a bit heavy, so this might influence my view of these shoes, but I really enjoy them! They are nice and comfortable and the toe box is just wide enough so my bunion will be comfortable but not too wide that I dont feel secure, have been wearing them for months before this review ans they still are in good condition. Again I might be biased by my previous experience but I would highly recommend them"
Asics,5,"My second pair of these shoes. I wear an 8 regular and an 8 fits perfectly. Nice looking, lots of color options, and comfortable."
Asics,5,My second pair! Love the support and duriblity! I have bad knees and these are the best shoes  fit my knees do nothing hurt after long walks anymore! I did size up 1/2 size for I have a long Big tie. Do not hesitate to buy these! So comfortable right out of the box!
Asics,5,"My second pair.  I love them!  I get a size larger, so I can put my podiatrist made inserts into them.  Perfect!"
Asics,5,"My shoes were exactly as pictured. Light pink, gray and black. I love them! They are super comfortable too. Going on 2 weeks now of using them almost daily at the gym. No issues"
Asics,5,My sister has not yet had the chance to use them because I need to get them to her and it takes some time because she is in another country where the postage is many times the cost of the shoes.  I love the pair I got and the is the reason I bought this pair for my sister.
Asics,5,"My size is 10.5N and that is very difficult to find in stores at all.  I was hesitant to buy a shoe online since you can't try them on like you can in a brick & mortar store, but these were a free return offer, so I decided to risk it.  I am so pleased!!!  The fit is great and the shoe is comfortable.  They even have room for my orthotics.  No slippage in the heel and room for my toes.  Nice!  Just ordered a second pair."
Asics,5,"My usual walking route includes a little of just about every type of terrain: paved sidewalks/roads, unpaved wooded trail, grassy areas, and dirt path covered with gravel.  These shoes perform well and provide adequate cushion in all areas.  The foot bed is wide and comfortable, and the fit is true to size.  Very pleased with them."
Asics,5,"My wife always buys cheap shoes for runners and walking, I gave her these for Christmas and she is in love . She couldn’t be happier. Wonderful fit side to side . Exactly comfort"
Asics,5,My wife has a challenge finding shoes that fit well. She has problem feet not to mention severe fallen arches. It's always been a challenge finding shoes that fit and are comfortable. The ASICS Women's Gel-Venture 7 Running Shoes are better than anything she's worn. She walks a lot and golfs a fair amount. She uses these for both. Another pair will be ordered soon for future use. 2 thumbs up!!!
Asics,5,"My wife is super happy with the way these look, and she likes the cushioning."
Asics,5,My Wife is very happy with them
Asics,5,My wife loved them. First nice running shoes she has owned.
Asics,5,My wife loves her new shoes I bought for her birthday. She works in the hospital and on her feet for hours. She says they are very comfortable and her do not hurt at the end of her shift.
Asics,5,My wife loves her new shoes!
Asics,5,My wife loves hers. I purchased them for her in an effort to get her walking and it worked. So far
Asics,5,My wife loves them
Asics,5,"My wife loves them for the price, look and comfort."
Asics,5,N gusto todo.
Asics,5,Needed a shoe that would provide support at work. I am on my feet for 12 hours a day. I have Worn this shoe for 3 weeks. Great support and comfort. Mesh provides flexibility in the upper part of shoe. I have purchased this brand before and a good experience. The price from this vendor is fantastic.
Asics,5,"Needed some new tennis shoes for bike riding and just for errand running. These are nice, look good for older woman as well as younger women.  Fits as expected and the colors are very neutral."
Asics,5,never goes wrong w/ that one... very comfortable
Asics,5,New favorite shoes I really love these very comfy and just look so nice on! Size is true to fit I am always 7 or 7.5
Asics,5,Nice
Asics,5,Nice and wide! I ordered a 10 w because asics are cut narrow but these fit great!
Asics,5,"Nice color, very comfortable. My daughter likes it very much."
Asics,5,Nice comfortable shoes
Asics,5,Nice fit!
Asics,5,"Nice looking, good fitting"

Asics,5,"Nice shoe, good fit, lightweight"
Asics,5,Nice shoe.
Asics,5,Nice shoe.
Asics,5,nice sneaker
Asics,5,Nice sneakers
Asics,5,Nice stylish. Looks exactly like picture.
Asics,5,Nice to find a sneaker in a half size over a 10 women's and with a wide width!  They're quite comfortable!
Asics,5,Nice vibrant colors for spring/summer.
Asics,5,Nice walking sneakers
Asics,5,"No dislikes at all! Love the fit, very happy with this purchase!!"
Asics,5,no need to break them in. very comfy right from the start
Asics,5,No problems at all
Asics,5,"Non slip, perfect fit, supportive"
Asics,5,Normally wear a 7 1/2 but order an 8 in this brand which is only brand I will buy. Second pair and love them. Great price for a long lasting well wearing shoe. I do not use it for jogging or running just walking or if don’t want to wear boots. Highly recommend!!!!
Asics,5,"Normally wear New Balance but decided to try these and they fit great. I have flat feet and run 3 to 5 miles most days and these are comfortable without having to be ""broken in"". There are slightly narrower in the toe box than New Balance."
Asics,5,"Not bad for a cheaper shoe. Got this for running training and today was my first day out with them. They aren’t broken in yet, but so far I went out on a easy 3 mile walk run, and they were pretty comfortable. At first they poked the top of my foot where the forefoot bends. But that disappeared after the first mile or two. I’m usually a forefoot striker, but these encouraged more of a mid-foot strike for me.  I’m excited to see how these hold up"
Asics,5,Not great for running if you are a heel runner. Great arch support and good for walking.
Asics,5,"Not only are they pretty, but they are super durable and super comfortable."
Asics,5,Not the coloring that was pictured when I ordered them.
Asics,5,Nothing
Asics,5,now i jump higher
Asics,5,Oh. My. God. These shoes are unbelievably comfortable! Probably the most comfortable running shoes I’ve ever worn. Highly recommend.
Asics,5,Ohhhhh sooooo comfy!!! Excellent arch support! Feels like a cloud us gently hugging my feet and I am thrilled with these!
Asics,5,"Okay, so if you have weird feet, these will fit you.

I have always had trouble finding shoes, especially running shoes that will fit my feet. I have very small feet, very high arches, a wide ball area, a very round heel and a high top curve. I have enormous amount of foot pain from plantar fasciitis, and what they think may be arthritis or fibromyalgia.

These shoes are perfect. They cup my feet just the right way, take away almost all of my pain while exercising as they are supportive in all the right places, and are very comfy with the cushion they have. The bounce back from when my feet hit the pavement is nice on my bad knees, and helps me get into a rhythm quickly.

As a 26 year old trying to get into exercising/health and fitness, these are a great stepping stone for me. They actually make me want to go out and experience runs.

The purple color is also very similar to what is shown in the picture. It's really pretty, and is very different than my overall black aesthetic I normally have. I'll be looking at getting the teal ones next so I can alternate."
Asics,5,OMG these are the best fitting shoes. I most defiantly will purchase these again.
Asics,5,On my feet all day at work
Asics,5,On my feet all day. Love these. I have a wide foot and bought the 7.5 wide. 💖💖💖💖💖
Asics,5,"once again this sneakers came through for me.  Tried nb but they hurt my toes, also tried another brand but arches were too high, I guess once you find a brand that works for you everytime you should stick to it and that's what I'm going to do from now on.  The price wasn't bad either."
Asics,5,One of the most comfortable pair of shoes I’ve ever owned!! Love these 😊
Asics,5,"Only problem,  laces don't stay tied .  Easy fix though"
Asics,5,Only tennis shoes that I can wear because they don’t make my feet hurt or my back.
Asics,5,"Only thing I don't like about these shoes is the shoe laces are paper thin but the rest of the shoe is exactly what I expected. Sleek, good grip on the bottom, and easy to clean.  My current favorite brand very well made and attractive design."
Asics,5,Ordered these based on previous sizes I have worn and they fit perfectly. Very happy with this product and seller.
Asics,5,"Ordering, delivery and product were outstanding!"
Asics,5,Originales. Livianos y súper cómodos para caminar. Tengo fascitis plantar y son perfectos para mi.
Asics,5,"Over the last few years I've tried different brands and discovered that ASICS are the best fit for my feet. Love, love, love them. Comfortable,  great support and different colors to choose from. I wore the last pair for 3 years daily and they were still whole, just a bit faded. Unbeatable deal for the money."
Asics,5,Padding in the shoes is great. Very comfortable!

Asics,5,Perfect! Just what I Ordered and expected.
Asics,5,"Perfect, I do wish it had heavier shoe laces."

Asics,5,Perfecto! Lo que esperaba
Asics,5,Permit fit.
Asics,5,Plenty of room in the toebox.  Great fot overall.  I wear a 6.5 but i usually purchase a 7 in asics.  This color combination is really nice without the heavy black shoe look.  Great sneaker.
Asics,5,Pretty color.  Fit well.  Good price.
Asics,5,Previously had Asics Gel Nimbus 7.  I was happy with the shoe but wanted something a little less expensive.  I am not a walker not a runner so that may matter to some.  Very comfortable shoe and I would buy again.
Asics,5,Product as described and wear almost every day.
Asics,5,Product came quickly and I use them for playing pickleball. Super comfortable and great support.  No sore knees!
Asics,5,"Product fits perfect,  as expected!"
Asics,5,Product fits well. I have been using this model for as long as I remember. This particular pair is lighter than the previous ones I had. Don’t mind the fluorescent green soles.
Asics,5,Provides great support! I go through so many pairs of sneakers wit my job and these seem to hold up great. Takes a little to break in but asics never disappoints
Asics,5,Purchased these shoes for my mom for Christmas and she loves them. Great walking shoe.

Asics,5,Satisfied..
Asics,5,"Second pair of Asics shoes I've bought. Once again, Asics did not disappoint. I need tennis/running shoes for work (veterinary technician) as I'm on my feet all day long, and these shoes fit the bill. Very happy with this purchase."
Asics,5,Second pair of this style of Asics. Perfect for walking. Lots of support and comfortable. I have problems with my feet and these shoes are great!
Asics,5,second pair.. enough said
Asics,5,Second time buying this particular brand and style due to comfort when walking 2 miles each day.
Asics,5,"Seriously, I love the way these shoes have both stability for uneven terrain walking and for moderate weight lifting. I bought 3 pairs total, I like them that much.  I need a lot of stability as well as forefoot cushioning. These shoes deliver. I bought up a half size, from 7.5 street shoe to 8M. ASICS usually fit small for me. My big toe tends to curl up so I need a roomy toebox. This model delivers for me. Lots of good color combos to choose from!"
Asics,5,"She had an earlier version of the shoes and was trying to get the same size, make and model.  This is a couple of iterations up from older version.  We had to send back the first order as it was a bit small lengthwise.  We had to order the next half size up from what she normally wears.  She was concerned that  the wider width might be too wide at that next size up.  However, she seems to like them and agreed that a 5 star rating was appropriate.  Only time will tell how long they last.  So far so good."
Asics,5,She loves them!
Asics,5,She said the shoes fit perfectly!
Asics,5,She wears them all the time!
Asics,5,Shoe felt like I'd been wearing them for months on first wear.
Asics,5,Shoe fits as expected and very comfortable.
Asics,5,Shoe fits great! Would buy again.
Asics,5,Shoe fits true to size and provides all day comfort! Shoe is worn 10 plus hours a day and my feet don’t hurt afterward. I would buy again.
Asics,5,Shoe is lightweight with toe box and heel fitting perfectly fit daily 5 mile walks.  Excellent product
Asics,5,"Shoe seems great, I have a medical heel problem Plantar Fastitus and hope the shoes will help alleviate the problem, so far so good, and enjoy the sizing, always 1/2 size up for these shoes!

Thank you!

Mrs. W"
Asics,5,Shoes are great.  Photo on Amazon is accurate but description of black/silver is wrong.  They are in fact navy blue and silver with some aqua markings.  Trust photo.  Computer issues aren't allowing me to post a photo but for color guidance trust the photo on Amazon .

Asics,5,Size 6.5 perfect fit. Lightweight.
Asics,5,Size is accurate.  Nice colors.
Asics,5,"Size was true, color is as expected, shoelaces have a bit of pizazz, and the actual shoe is a bit more sturdy, and less flexible than the Gel-Venture 6. Does this present a problem of discomfort (no), blisters (no), shoe happier worn outside than inside (yes)."
Asics,5,Size were on point and very comfortable.
Asics,5,Sized right
Asics,5,"Sizes as expected and very comfy for running .  I had wide feet, big toes, and high instep.  It is really hard for me to shop shoes online without try it first.  After reading many reviews I gave this shoes a try.  It fits pretty well and comfy.  The only complaint is the shoelaces is kinda short. I need use the top hole to stabilize my feet and the shoelaces fell short.  Not a deal breaker as I can change a longer one my own.  Fit and compfy always come first."
Asics,5,Sneakers are very comfortable and the fit is as expected.
Asics,5,Sneakers arrived on time and in good delivery condition. I like the sneakers for work and are very comfortable.
Asics,5,So comfortable
Asics,5,So comfortable
Asics,5,So comfortable and cute.
Asics,5,So comfortable and flexible. I have heal spurs and these sneakers help ease the pain
Asics,5,So comfortable and plenty of room. I love them.
Asics,5,"So comfortable and very nice looking. I walk three miles a day, these are perfect!"
Asics,5,So comfortable for walking
Asics,5,"So comfortable! I love these shoes.
I’ve never really had “running” shoes before, and I plan on running a half marathon. These shoes offer so much support. They get a little hot when I run or walk in them, but that’s okay. So glad I bought these."
Asics,5,"So comfortable! Light weight, good quality,  Lots of compliments"
Asics,5,So comfortable! Love the vibrant colors.
Asics,5,"So comfortable, these gel-venture 7's are so great.  I've owned several earlier versions of these and these are an upgrade in the toe box top liner and are much less prone to wearing a hole.  The grey color is neutral enough to go with everything."
Asics,5,So comfortable... with my orthotics or with out!!! They are a great shoe
Asics,5,So comfy! I love ASICS! And the colors are very cute!
Asics,5,So cute! I originally purchased them as shoes for work because I’m always on my feet but their so adorable I don’t even want to wear them to work anymore!
Asics,5,So cute! Love these shoes!
Asics,5,So far so good shoes fit great and feel great?
Asics,5,"So far so good. light, roomy at the toe area.  price is reasonable as well.  I like the bright color too."
Asics,5,"So far, I just received today before I was going to my favorite trail. I have a pair of FILA and RYKA. The FILA’s are hard and not giving the ryka’s are better but I had the rykas on when the delivery guy came and I put on the ASICS. I was worried that I should have purchased the 9 1/2 but after I got the 9’s on and walked around I realized they would work. Also, I have bunions and purchased a wide and that worked also.
Walking in the ASICS was more cushioned than my others and for a walker, that is important.

So far, so good"
Asics,5,"So far, so good. I went from New Balance to Asics. The fit (6.5W) is perfect. I hope they don't show wear and tear at the collar right away, like the New Balance did. And these are comfortable on my bunion. I highly recommend these."
Asics,5,"So far, they fit great and feel great. Just as they were in the picture. Great packaging."
Asics,5,So glad I bought these! My sister’s podiatrist told her that ASICS were the best for support and they are! These are the best fit and comfort walking shoes ever!
Asics,5,So glad these were in stock! Great price
Asics,5,So happy with my new tennis shoes!
Asics,5,"So I bought my first pair of ASICS (in a long time) a few months ago. They are my usual 7M size, but pinched my toes and gave me blisters. Well, I kept them, taped up my toes and bought thicker socks. Those actually fit well now. I noticed the reviews on these and decided to go with 7W this time and I love them! Super comfortable, easy to walk far in from the start. I don’t have wide feet in any other brand, only ASICS. I recommend the wide size if you have medium size feet, they run extremely narrow."
Asics,5,"So I had fallen for an ad on Facebook from ASICS about their new Adrenaline 13’s and paid about twice this much for them. When I got them they were pretty but the most uncomfortable shoe I had ever worn. I wore them to run to the grocery store and my toes were numb by the time I left the store. I promptly returned them. So when I saw these I was hesitant, remembering my past experience with this brand. But I ordered a half size up and let me tell you it makes all the difference! I’m so happy now with these. They are extremely comfortable, and cute. I got them to go with a navy blue shirt and shorts that I got. I ordered the black/silver hoping the description of the color was wrong and it was, these are navy blue and a teal color. So the seller might want to change that. I got the color I wanted so I’m happy."
Asics,5,So I have had the venture 5’s (two pair) the venture 6’s and now these. The 5’s were my favorite but now I think these are. The venture 6’s just were not even close to the same quality as the 5s and I feel like these are and I was nervous to buy anything but the 5’s. So happy I did! The only thing that isn’t my favorite is the shoe strings but that can easily be replaced!
Asics,5,"So I ordered the Black/Orange Pop versions, and they're in reality a very dark blue/navy with fun mint green soles and orange stripes and yellowish heel accents. Super cute and very comfortable. Will likely get another pair that's actually black."
Asics,5,So so comfortable!!! I wear a 10 1/2 and my feet look so cute and stylish. About to purchase another pair in a different color
Asics,5,So so definitely comfortable and the best shoes I had for winter in the snow. Runs a smidge small but with thin socks bit bad at all.
Asics,5,So very comfy  look good also
Asics,5,So worth the wait when these were out of stick. Seriously one of the most comfortable shots I've ever owned 💜
Asics,5,Some of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have owned. I love them
Asics,5,Son los mejores zapatos deportivos que existen en el mercado. 5 estrellas
Asics,5,Stand long periods of time at my job and these shoes feel great on my feet. Light weight comfortable and great support.
Asics,5,Such a comfortable cloud like sneaker!!! I work at Costco where the floors are made of cement resulting in plantar fasciitis. Not even Nike’s can help because my heel is in a lot of pain. I highly recomendable this sneaker if you are dealing with plantar fasciitis.
Asics,5,Suoer hermoso 💚 y para correr sumamente confortable me encanta 💖
Asics,5,Super comfortable
Asics,5,Super comfortable
Asics,5,Super comfortable for on trail activities.  They are also a terrific Dodger Blue which is why I bought them.
Asics,5,"Super comfortable sneaker...especially when I am on my feet all day at work.  Nice colors, also."
Asics,5,Super comfortable sneakers. Style is nice. Really happy with purchase
Asics,5,"Super comfortable! The shoes are true to size. The gel isn't obnoxiously thick or padded, but enough to make me feel like I've been wearing these shoes for months as oppose to days. No break in needed. The colors are pretty and feminine enough, but without having to worry about getting them dirty. It was so hard to find black shoes with soles in a color other than white! The only thing I would change are the shoelaces. They seem a tad bit short and somewhat slippery (?). But those can always be changed.

If you love Asics and you have worn their shoes before, you won't be disappointed with this style, comfort of fit. I'm tempted to buy another pair in a different color!"
Asics,5,"Super comfortable,  no break in time"
Asics,5,"Super comfortable, fits great!"
Asics,5,Super comfy and great for 5k training

Asics,5,Super happy with this !
Asics,5,Super light and comfortable

Asics,5,Super Support and arch!
Asics,5,"Super supportive, comfortable, and cute. Made me want to go to the gym and I felt so cute. I always like asics over other running or workout shoes. Highly recommend these shoes."
Asics,5,"Tal cual la descripción, excelente producto y excelente la talla."
Asics,5,Thank you Amazon for offering the Asic brand. I ordered 2 more pairs because of the comfort and fit. The colors to choose from are great too.
Asics,5,"Thank you ASICS for carrying the 9,5 wide size! It’s so rare to find my actual size that I usually go a size  / size and a half up To compensate for the wide fit. But having recently started going to gym classes I needed to have a shoe that actually fits well and it’s comfortable, otherwise I was in a world of pain. This shoe is everything I wanted!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!"
Asics,5,thanks
Asics,5,"Thanks to a prior reviewer who ‘gave up’ on wearing Rykas and went back to her older, worn but more comfortable ASICS, I now have a new go-to brand to buy. They’re a bit firmer on my foot right out of the box (than the other brand with memory foam), but they are cushioned, supportive and I believe they’ll last longer than the 6 month life I was getting from the other brand. I like the look better too."
Asics,5,The best one yet!!!
Asics,5,The best shoe so far on concrete for 10 hours. My hips and knees would normally be hurting after my work day but not with these shoes. I love them I got 2 pairs to rotate them out as to not wear them out to quickly.
Asics,5,"The best shoes for mid-length hikes I have found. Good support, no pressure points, great soles on wet trails."
Asics,5,The best shoes for the medical field. We are on our feet 12hrs.
Asics,5,The best shoes I have ever owned. I’m walking 6 to 7 miles each day without my feet killing me at the end of the day.
Asics,5,"The blue shoes are really pretty in person.... not as important as comfort, but I really like the colors of this shoe. This is my second pair in this shoe and the gel sole and the heel are very comfortable"
Asics,5,The color is fantastic. Perfect shoes they match everything.
Asics,5,The colors and fi t
Asics,5,The comfort. Of the shoe was great!
Asics,5,The description says black and silver.  The only think black is part of the sole. If you're looking for black tennis shoes these are not it.  Description says black they are navy. They are being returned
Asics,5,The design is nice. Fits as expected. It's comfortable and made of good quality. I've worn it for some runs and it's been comfortable. Good buy.
Asics,5,The fit and support were great. Recipient loves the comfort and the support.
Asics,5,The fit is good
Asics,5,The fit was just as I had hoped they’re super comfortable I’ve had ascis before and they are everything that you can expect from the sneaker.
Asics,5,"The fit works get for me, seems true to size. The soft interior soles are great, very comfortable. Colors are vibrant, love them! Great shoe all around."
Asics,5,The gel membrane works really well. I like the fit and the color. I recommend these shoes. 😊
Asics,5,"The insoles where comfortable and the shoe itself well made. But the design rubbed up against my bunion which caused me pain, so it wasn't the shoe just didn't work with my feet. So I had to return the sneaker."
Asics,5,The lightness and fit of the shoe was perfect!
Asics,5,The most comfortable shoes! First long walk and no issues!
Asics,5,"The most comfortable sneaker I've ever worn. I'm using these for walking everyday. First time I didn't have to break a sneaker in, no blisters, yeah! Oh very cute too."
Asics,5,The only things wrong is I wish I could have bought two pairs because when these could no longer be worn I couldn't find another pair in my size.
Asics,5,The pants fit well and are very comfortable.... can’t wait to wear them while exercising.
Asics,5,The round toe box makes this shoe exceptionally comfortable.
Asics,5,"The running shoes were exactly as pictured and were delivered on time. They fit me perfectly. I always thought I'd have to try on shoes before purchasing, but once Covid hit, I took a chance and ordered them online. This is my 2nd pair because I wear them everyday. Very happy with this purchase!"
Asics,5,The second time I wore these was on a 9 mile hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park. We went over extremely rough terrain and these held up perfectly. I would definitely buy again.
Asics,5,"The shoe is great, I love Asics.  The only issue I have is that the tongue  on the left shoe will fall to the left side of the shoe so after I've been walking for a while, I have to stop and pull it back up to the middle of my shoe."
Asics,5,The shoe is perfect.  Looks great and fits perfect.  Very comfortable and good for standing long hours.  ASICS is always a great shoe.
Asics,5,The shoe is what I am looking for. However needed larger size.
Asics,5,The shoe was described perfectly and it fit as expected- i prefer to try shoes on and I was impressed they met my expectations
Asics,5,The shoes are a good fit
Asics,5,The shoes are a perfect fit. Very comfortable.
Asics,5,"The shoes are as advertised. I'm not as crazy about the color (purple) as I thought I would be, but that's not the seller's fault, and it's certainly not something that I can't live with. Overall, it's a good shoe, and it will work fine for my needs."
Asics,5,"The shoes are better than expected in design, fit and comfort."
Asics,5,"The shoe's are exactly as pictured. They fit properly, the are comfortable, and everything I wanted in a shoe!!! Thank you!"

Asics,5,The shoes fit perfect all around
Asics,5,The shoes fit perfect. Very comfortable
Asics,5,The shoes fit perfectly and love the color!
Asics,5,"The shoes fit smaller than other asics I've bought. They are not cushiony like gel running shoes, they are more ridged, they are hiking shoes I guess, but I do use them for walking on the highway. They give my ankles good support."
Asics,5,The shoes fit well. They are what I expected.
Asics,5,"The shoes I used to wear were a little uncomfortable, so I changed into these running shoes. They're super comfortable.
Your feet will not feel tired after running for a long time.
like"
Asics,5,The shoes were just what I ordered and came in quickly! Very impressed!!
Asics,5,The show is striking  and comfortable however it was tight I normally worn 6 1/2. In order for a good fit I would have needed a 61/2 wide. This was the only reason for return.
Asics,5,The size is a bit small. I usually wear 6.5 (dress shoes) or size 7 (sneakers) but I had to order size 7.5. Had to return a pair of size 7. It fits well.
Asics,5,The sneakers are very comfortable & the seller delivered earlier than expected which was a great surprise 👍🏼
Asics,5,"The style is cute. It's very comfotable. The fact that they carry a larger size is great! I would have liked a nonskid sole. Otherwise, a great shoe."
Asics,5,"The very best of running shoes BUT these shoes are NOT black/silver! They are navy, dark purple (aubergine), and lavender! And there are turquoise accents!"
Asics,5,The wide is a true wide.
Asics,5,The wife loves the color.
Asics,5,There is just enough give to make them comfortable yet they are very durable.  I love the colors.  I have foot issues and they don't hurt my feet like other brands.
Asics,5,These  are  very comfortable  from day one. I have never had  this brand before. I'm very impressed.
Asics,5,These always fit really well and are so comfortable.  Love this brand
Asics,5,"These are awesome shoes! I had a year-old pair of foam-soled New
balances that made every part of me hurt after wearing them. The difference between those and these Asics is like night & day.
I’m so excited to get out there with my new shoes. They are supportive and flexible and I love the variety of colors."
Asics,5,These are awesome! They hug your feet in all the right places and I love this brand💜
Asics,5,"These are comfortable and fit well. Are usually wear 9 wide or 9.5, but my size was not available so I took a risk and ordered a 10. I’m glad I did. They fit perfectly. The color is as pictured, sort of a maroon. I like that the sole is beige rather than bright white."
Asics,5,"These are comfortable and good quality. I’ve purchased two pairs of these previously with the regular width, and those are comfortable as well. I have problems with my feet, especially if I’m doing yard work or activities where I put a lot of pressure on my toes. These tennis shoes are comfortable in the toe box, both in the regular width and wide width. I have a small bunion on my right foot, and this is the first “wide” size shoe I’ve purchased. I’m very glad I tried these."
Asics,5,"These are comfortable and the measurement guide matched the right size of shoe for me, perfectly.

The only thing I don't understand is why certain colors cost more than others, even though they are the same shoe, otherwise."
Asics,5,"These are comfortable right out of the box! I got a wide, and they fit perfectly in the toe box. Glad I read the reviews because I wanted navy blue and that’s what people said they got when ordering the black/silver. Perfect!"
Asics,5,These are comfortable to walk in all day!
Asics,5,These are great
Asics,5,"These are great for the gym, light weight and sturdy"
Asics,5,"These are great shoes for being on your feet for a long day. I never feel any discomfort when wearing these. I keep buying this model, just alternate colors. Will buy again."
Asics,5,These are great shoes for coaching softball.  The dirt on our softball field can really stain shoes but I don't have the same problem with my new ASICS because there is not much white on them.
Asics,5,These are great shoes! I have a real wide foot for a woman and often have a hard time finding shoes but these perfect.
Asics,5,"These are great, they fit really well! I got the wide fit so I went down from an 8 to a 7 1/2 to account for the extra width and they fit perfectly! The laces could be a little sturdier, but the shoes themselves seem very durable, and I wore them all day right out of the box and I’m not at all foot sore. I have high arched feet and these mold comfortably to my arches, which is a big plus."
Asics,5,"These are incredibly comfortable!  I wear them while running, walking the neighborhood with the family,  and when out and about.  I love their look and overall versatility. Personally I think they're a great buy."
Asics,5,"These are my first asics, so I'm a newbie, but the feature that i like the most is the gel heel."
Asics,5,"These are my go-to walking shoes.  They fit great and have excellent support for overpronators like me.  I have orthotics, but they fit just fine inside.  I have worn through 3 pairs of Asics already simply because I wear them all the time.  They are definitely worth it!"
Asics,5,"These are my second pair of this style, they seem to hold up better than another style I got. Great for work & exercising."
Asics,5,"These are probably the best sneakers I've had. I had never bought shoes online before but I wore a hole in my old sneakers and couldn't go to the store during the pandemic. These are lightweight, true to size, and very comfortable. I have somewhat low arches and they did not require any ""breaking in."" I've been walking, hiking, and biking in them (not a runner so I can't comment on that)."
Asics,5,These are replacing year-old Asics Gel venture sneakers. They are comfortable right out of the box. They are supportive yet light weight.
Asics,5,These are so cute and comfortable
Asics,5,These are some of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn. I am usually a Nike girl but my mom (who works in a hospital) recommended I try these. She was right. I might never go back to Nike.
Asics,5,These are super comfortable and look so nice!
Asics,5,These are super nice..
Asics,5,These are the 3rd pair of ASICS I’ve purchased. Love the support and comfort. I don’t even try another sneaker.

Asics,5,These are very comfortable  shoes. I love them
Asics,5,These are very comfortable and light weight.  I didn't feel I needed to break them in.  It's a good looking shoe.
Asics,5,These are very comfortable but fits a bit on the large side. I normally wear a 7.5W and that's what I ordered but theybare a bit too big. I will order again because I am pleased with them but I will order a size down. I also ordered the mauve/purpley color and is a great color. Very well made.
Asics,5,These are very comfortable. My local store didn't have this color in my size so... Amazon to the rescue !!  They are alittle pricy.  The laces are slippery and kinda short . I re configured the lacing to give me more length to tie and problem solved.  These are my first ASICS shoes. I do recommend these shoes. I'm not a runner just a walker. They fit true to size.
Asics,5,These are very extremely comfortable shoes
Asics,5,These are very nice and fit just as expected.  I would get them if you are on the fence.
Asics,5,These are very nice shoes.  Very comfortable and true to size.  I love the colors too.
Asics,5,These Asics are very comfortable. There's a lot of cushion. Good value. I wear a size 9 and after reading the reviews I went with the wide width and I'm glad I did. I always wore Nike's but Asics may have converted me. I recommend these sneakers.
Asics,5,"These Asics gel venture never let me down. Supportive, durable, they are indestructible!  And so comfortable. A super walking shoe. Great quality at an affordable price."
Asics,5,"These ASICS sneakers are the most comfortable and supporting of that brand - which I buy exclusively - that
I've tried.  There is breathability in the mesh, and I found it less tight and more easy in the fit (size 9W).
I am really enjoying this pair of sneakers!"
Asics,5,"These came earlier than expected, which was very nice. I'm able to enjoy them during the great weather this weekend.
Packaging and UPS delivery were OUTSTANDING.
They fit well and are very comfortable.
I LOVE the design and color!"

Asics,5,These fit very comfortably. Very happy with them
Asics,5,"These have been great walking shoes for the last few years...sometimes a size 7 fits me, sometimes I go up a half size...these I went up a half size...then they're comfortable and are great!"
Asics,5,"These have held up remarkably well to all of the gardening, grocery runs, and various errands I've done since I got them. No tread wear, and very comfortable. I typically don't like wearing shoes for long hours, but I hardly notice I'm wearing these."
Asics,5,These have really helped with my feet and working 8+ Hours a day on them.
Asics,5,"These have the necessary support and toe room, and they're attractive. What more could I want?"

Asics,5,These shoes are amazing and SO comfortable!!

Asics,5,These shoes are bad to the bone. Exactly what I was looking for. Lightweight and supportive and I absolutely love the colors. Would definitely recommend.
Asics,5,These shoes are comfortable im glad I got them
Asics,5,These shoes are comfortable to me and give the support I need
Asics,5,These shoes are comfortable to walk and run with. The shoes also has gel inside that prevents my feet from getting blisters and hurting when running with them. I done long distance walking in them on day one to break them in.

Asics,5,"These shoes are FABULOUS! I have tried many Asics. I have lower back issues and plantar faciaitis. I am a walker, not a runner. I wan 100 miles per month so I go through shoes about every 3 months. (So I wanted cheaper shoes than the Asics Kayano-my fav!) I recently purchased the Asics Nimbus and Asics Gel-Cumulus. The Asics Venture 7 is by far the best choice for me! I walked 10 miles this weekend without breaking them in and I literally have no foot pain or soreness. I highly recommend these shoes for someone looking to spend $40-$50 on a pair. They fit exactly true to size also. 5 stars"
Asics,5,"These shoes are fantastic in fit, wear, appearance, and the price is great! This is my second pair in this color and I bought another color I like just as well."
Asics,5,"These shoes are good fit for my feet, supportive and comfortable."
Asics,5,These shoes are great and so comfortable.
Asics,5,These shoes are great. I use them for work and they are so comfortable!
Asics,5,"These shoes are hands down the best. I’ve tried a lot of other running shoes but nothing beats these! My sister and I liked them so much that we both ordered two pairs. We run 5 miles every morning and these really made a difference. They’re comfortable, have great support, and really good shock absorption. If you jog you need to get these!"
Asics,5,These shoes are immensely comfortable. I’m really glad with this purchase. These are great for my long distance runs.
Asics,5,"These shoes are like walking on a cloud! I wear these 8-14 hours a day, Best shoes ever!!!!"
Asics,5,These shoes are my favorite shoe. They are light weight and flexible. They are the only kind of shoe that I wear.
Asics,5,These shoes are navy blue and very comfy
Asics,5,"These shoes are really comfortable. The laces are a bit thin, which was surprising, but it has not negatively impacted tying the shoes yet. I would definitely purchase this pair again."

Asics,5,These shoes fit well and are extremely comfortable.
Asics,5,"These shoes fit well and are very comfortable.  They are advertised as having ""neutral"" support; I supinate.  They're lightweight.  They're sold as trail runners.  I'm not a trail runner, but they work well for walking, and they were priced in the walking-shoe range.  I like the gray outsole, which blends with grime better than white.  I've only had them for a couple of weeks so I can't speak to durability, but they appear to be put together very well.

One very small quibble - the flat laces.  Why, outside of ""style""? (They have a blue and black woven pattern.)  I replaced them with oval laces, which are easier to tie and untie and usually last longer.

One request:  Some lighter base colors, in the brown/tan/beige range."
Asics,5,These shoes fit well and well made. Very comfortable for walking. I’m not a runner so can’t comment on that. Seem to have good arch support too.

Asics,5,These shoes were recommended by my podiatrist.... they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Very supportive and the fit is just perfect. I don't want to take them off! I have wide feet and they are sensitive with neuropathy.
Asics,5,These shoes were very comfortable from the first time I put them on my feet. I use them to walk my dogs on urban trails and as everyday sneakers.
Asics,5,These sneakers are great and comfortable!  Love the style and the comfort of the insert.  I have flat feet and suffer from plantar fascitis at times.
Asics,5,"These sneakers are great, light when walking , bought 1 size up, because the reviews said to order up.I usually wear a size 8, medium, went with the 9, glad I did, because the return  would be a hassle, and they feel great, plenty of room, and don’t feel tight. Walked 2 miles without breaking them in and I had no blisters or pain with walking. I recommend this sneaker."
Asics,5,"These sneakers are great, my daughter loves them!"
Asics,5,"These sneakers are true to size and fit well with a very comfortable toe box. The laces aren’t excessively long either which I like so they don’t drag on the ground like some others I’ve had. In fact they are a bit short to double knot if you like to do that to your laces.  They also have the extra eyelets to get a snugger fit when tied. They are called black/silver but are primarily navy. Gray soles will look nicer longer, not showing the dirt as easily as a white sole would. Look very nice! Love them!"
Asics,5,These sneakers was a great fit and it was very comfortable when I walk in them. I will order them again when they wear out. I have found my brand of sneakers.
Asics,5,These trainers are so comfortable  that I almost forget that I'm still on week 4 of the couch 2 5k program.  Awesome  buy feels as comfortable  as Brooks but considerably  less expensive.
Asics,5,"These were my first pair of ASICS shoes and I am very impressed by how comfortable they are. They aren't really my style, but I took a friend's advice and tried them out. Compared to all of my other running shoes, these are by far the most comfortable, even right out of the box. I wear a 7.5 in Nike and I wear a 7.5 in Asics."
Asics,5,"These were my first pair of running sneakers ""back in the day"".  I tried others of course but always returned to ASICS. I have wide feet and that makes a difference with lets say Nike or New Balance.  Although I did find a great pair of Nike for road running but that was it. When I saw ASICS I said that's it.  I have had running friends wearing them too.
Remember fits those wide feet with comfort.  Oh wait I am off to run see ya!"
Asics,5,"Theses shoes are durable and comfortable. I have always struggled to find a tennis shoe that has a good arch, yet stable enough to protect my ankles while walking on trials for under $100. These shoes really hit all the boxes! They are light weight, yet sturdy like a hiking shoe."
Asics,5,they are  a great shoe.  Use them for work.  If I et 6 months out of a shoe that is a good amount of time.  These tend to last a little longer.
Asics,5,They are a nice pair of shoes.
Asics,5,"They are a perfect fit, I ordered 8.5 wide because I wear 8.5 and since I have been walking around in slippers majority of the time for the past few months I figure my feet have swelled a bit. They are very comfortable. I am pleased with my purchase."

Asics,5,They are really comfortable shoes to wear and look like they will last awhile.  The shoes look just like the picture that's online and the arch support seems to be just as good as my shoes that have orthotics in them.  These are the most comfortable of my shoes.  I would highly reccomend them.

Asics,5,They are suppose to be wide but very tight. Slowly loosening up otherwise very comfortable

Asics,5,They fit perfectly. Very comfortable.
Asics,5,"They fit the overall length of my foot but feel really tight in the middle. Like the shoe isn't 'tall enough'? for my feet. I have to loosen the shoe strings for it to feel normal. They are otherwise comfortable. I took a long walk to break them in and they held up well. Where as my back and knees are usually in agony after a short walk, it took much much longer before the usual pain started and not even as bad as it usually is. So that's a start. If it weren't for the tightness in the middle of the foot I'd have given 5 stars. But they will do for now.

I'll be wearing these about 12 hours a day soon. So maybe I'll update on the comfort level and durability.

*UPDATE*
Ended up returning them to get the wide version and they fit perfectly. Still comfortable, if not more so now. I wasn't aware that I hadn't gotten the wide version and thought they just ran small. Changed the laces out because the original ones felt flimsy. Happy with purchase so far."
Asics,5,They fit true to size and are very comfortable considering I'm on my feet quite a bit.I work in a mailroom.
Asics,5,They fit true to size and are very comfortable. Went jogging in the park with them - no pain very comfortable!

Asics,5,They look great. I ordered the Grey/Violet blush and they are true to photo.  They are snug. Wish wide was an option.
Asics,5,They run a bit short for men and women.  2nd pair fit fine and comfortable.
Asics,5,They seem tight at first but I wore them around the house for an hour and found that they were perfect. Love the color and support. They will be great for hiking!!
Asics,5,They seem to fit nicely. I have tailor bunions so I ordered a 8 wide which is what I wear in a work boot. I haven't gotten to do anything but try them on at the moment will update when I do. But they seem to be sturdy and I believe I have enough room for insoles if I need them due to plantar fasciitis.
Asics,5,They took a couple of days to break in but are good now.  I use them for walking and not running.
Asics,5,They were a perfect fit and very comfortable I would recommend these to l everyone
Asics,5,They were great at the first try on. I use them for my weekday walks around our neighborhood.
Asics,5,They’re just fantastic! Like the color and love the fit.

Asics,5,"Third pair of these ASIC shoes that i have ordered, can't wear them out. Just like getting a new pair and then pass the other pair down for old shoes to wear on the farm"
Asics,5,"This  athletic shoe is sturdy and supportive for a medium, neutral gaited foot.  I am using it for not only hiking in dry, grounded paths but also across large smooth boulders due to the shoe's superior tread.  It is a fairly light-weight shoe, enough for a workout inside the gym."
Asics,5,this  is my 2nd  pair of Asics and 3rd pair should  arrive today.  Only  shoe I  have found that I can wear for more than a couple  of hours....and there are colors  to go with any thing.
Asics,5,This are so comfortable and give me just the support I need. I love them!
Asics,5,"This brand was highly recommended by my wife’s doctor. According to my wife they fit  perfectly, comfortable and weightless."
Asics,5,"This fit like the other Asics gel shoes but are more lightweight.  Not sure about the toe appearance, there is no tab on the toe."
Asics,5,"This fit perfectly. Size 9 women’s . Most importantly, they did not have the chemicals in them that cause my feet to burn. It is so difficult to find sneakers( or any shoe for that matter) that do not burn my feet badly. They do not have memory foam which is a product that causes bad pain. Will buy again."
Asics,5,This fit well and are extremely comfortable!  Love this brand.  Great color too
Asics,5,This has got to be the most comfortable pairs of sneakers I have ever had!
Asics,5,"This is a good-looking, well made, comfortable shoe. It’s like walking on a cloud."
Asics,5,This is a great shoe and fits really well.
Asics,5,This is a great shoe if you like to walk/run at parks with gravel (also great for regular paved paths). I typically wear on clouds but I started jogging again and was having knee pain do to previous sport injuries. I needed something with better support for trail running and jogs in the neighborhood and these have been great. I’ve been wearing them for 2 weeks now and typically run 3-5 miles.
Asics,5,"This is a great sneaker.  It gives a good level of support to the foot, which is important to me as I wear sneakers all day, every day.  There is also a nice cushion on the sole so that your foot feels good in the sneaker.  I would highly recommend and will be staying with this brand of sneaker going forward."
Asics,5,This is a stylish and comfortable shoe.
Asics,5,This is a very comfortable and cushioned sneaker.  It feels like there are cushions all around my feet and my feet are supported. I recommend this sneaker to anyone who needs a good supportive sneaker.
Asics,5,This is a very comfortable shoe. I am on my feet all day and these work great!
Asics,5,"This is an awesome shoe

just make sure that if you take the wide fit buy a half size down from your regular size"
Asics,5,This is an extremely comfortable shoe. If fit just as expected (true to size) and provides the right amount of support and cushioning.
Asics,5,"this is for my feet which are very sensitive, perfect! you can wiggle your toes and the footbed is cushioning. They are lightweight but sturdy and give great lateral support! I bought my husband a pair and he also really appreciates the comfort!"
Asics,5,This is my 2nd pair -held up to daily use on concrete floors
Asics,5,"This is my 2nd pair, the first pair lasted 11 years of wearing them at least 4 times a week. Great quality running shoes!"
Asics,5,This is my 4th pair of this shoe. I walk a lot and know that if I order this style all the guessing is gone. Very good value for the price. Fit is consistent.
Asics,5,This is my 4th pair. As a nurse I am on my feet a lot and this is the only shoe I found that doesn't make my back and knees hurr
Asics,5,"this is my favorite running shoe.  the front toe is not overly rounded so your foot does not move around in sneaker.
will order another pair in different color."
Asics,5,"This is my favorite shoe, i have a fused ankle and i walk so well with these."
Asics,5,"This is my first pair of Asics and they are exactly what I expected - super comfortable and my regular size fit me perfectly. There was no break-in period for me. I wore them on a 5 mile walk the first day I had them, and I had no blisters or pain, etc., at the end of my walk."
Asics,5,"This is my first time buying Asics shoe.  Usually buy Saucony 8W.  The Saucony's have not been holding up very long lately, so decided to try something different.  I use arch supports and they fit into the Asics just perfectly.  The shoes fit me and feel good so far.  Time will tell if they hold up better than Saucony.  They are light weight!"
Asics,5,This is my go to shoe.  Happy I can get on Amazon.
Asics,5,"This is my second pair of ASICS  that I’ve bought through Amazon. They are good looking shoes and have the arch support that I need.  The first time I wore them one felt a little snug on the right side of the shoe midway, but seem to have loosened a bit since then. Wore them for a two mile walk and my feet felt great.  One thing I really like about ASICS shoes is the wide widths. I’ve had a hard time finding decent, good looking, well made shoes made for wide feet."
Asics,5,"This is my second pair of ASICS venture gel 7 sneakers. I love these shoes, they suit me well. I do a lot of trail walking and they’ve been perfect."
Asics,5,This is my second pair of these I used to buy exclusively sketchers but I really like the way these look and feel they were great the moment I put them on no breaking them in or sore feet I would recommend these to anyone for walking shoes I'm not sure they have the support for working out but that could just be me
Asics,5,This is my second pair. I don't get knee pain when I wear these shoes. Extremely comfortable with good traction.
Asics,5,"This is my second pair. They’re really comfortable and fit very well. Mostly used for trail walking, but also neighborhood (concrete) walks. Definitely recommend."
Asics,5,"This is my third pair and I still love them.  They fit perfectly, the gel is amazing to my feet and did not take time to get broken in.  The style is really quite modern. Love the colors."
Asics,5,This is my third pair of trail running shoes. Very supportive and comfortable and fun colors.
Asics,5,"This is my third pair, love them! Very comfortable, love how supportive they are. Will definitely buy more in the future."
Asics,5,"This is my walking shoes, good support, good with ,no need to break them. Nice grey/ pink color.Good tennis shoes ,  just love them"
Asics,5,"This is not an ordinary silver and black shoe.  This shoe is a rich navy shoe with turquoise accents.  Even the laces are navy and turquoise to match!  It also has beautiful lavendar accents on the shoe.  I wear an 11 1/2 shoe.  If that isn't hard enough to find, my feet are very narrow.  From reviews, it appeared that this shoe might run narrower than some so I took a chance.  I was not excited about ordering  black and silver shoes but for my size, there never is much choice of style or color.  When I opened the box, I couldn't believe how beautiful these  shoe were!!  I even looked on the outside of the box to make sure I got the right shoes!  They are still wider than my narrow feet but only the heal slips up and down.  The shoelaces keep my toe part  in place.  Because these are the prettiest Navy shoes I have ever seen, I've decided to keep them.  I bought heal wedges at a shoe store.  I may also decide on a shoe insert with a built in arch support since the shoe doesn't seem to have much of an arch.  For all the lucky women who have a popular foot size,  I think this shoe runs true to size both in length and width."
Asics,5,This is the 3rd time I’ve bought these shoes.
Asics,5,This is the 4th pair of these sneakers I have purchased. That should say it all.
Asics,5,This is the first pair of asics shoes I have ever bought and they fit perfect! Better than any other brand
Asics,5,This is the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned.
Asics,5,This is the second pair I have bought because they are comfortable and last longer than other shoes.
Asics,5,"This is the second pair of Asics Gel-Venture running shoes I've had.  I absolutely love them.  Though I'm not a runner, I'm a walker and the comfort and quality is awesome.  I highly recommend these shoes!"
Asics,5,"This is the second pair of these I have purchased.  Working on my feet, standing for my shift, these have been the best shoe for me, giving me the support I need especially in the arches!"
Asics,5,"This isn't a very heavy shoe, very light support.  If you are hiking trails, it's not the best but still a good sneaker overall.  I would recommend something heavier for any kind of heavy trail or distance shoe."
Asics,5,This product fits awesome
Asics,5,This product fits really well. I received them in two days. So excited. Will order these again
Asics,5,This product fits wonderful and is absolutely the most comfortable shoe I have ever used. I run 3-4 miles 5 times a week and my feet don’t hurt in these.
Asics,5,This running shoes are great for your daily walk or running. Love the quality of the shoes. You get that nice gel support. Really comfortable and easy to use. I recommend it to anyone! My daughter loves this shoes.
Asics,5,This series of shoes really fit my feet well.  Shipped quickly and with correct item.
Asics,5,"This shoe did the trick! I’ve been suffering from metatarsal pain for a few months now and have been unable to walk long distances. But, with this shoe I’m back to walking long distances. I was very skeptical but was willing to give it a try. It worked! The firm sole and gel cushioning is very comforting on my foot.
I bought a size 8 which is typically what I wear. It fits fine. But, because I opted to use some metatarsal pads inside the shoe as well, I wished I had gone up a half a size or perhaps gone with a wide version.
I had no idea what a difference a good shoe would make!"
Asics,5,This shoe does not seem to be made with the quality of the same shoe I purchased twice from Kohls.  Also not as supportive.
Asics,5,"This shoe fit perfectly the instant I put them on. Super comfortable! No breaking-in! It’s been a very long time since I’ve had a shoe fit that well. This was my first time trying Asics, I had been wearing New Balance."
Asics,5,This shoe fit perfectly.  I especially like that there was a little room in the toe area.  Just right.
Asics,5,"This shoe fits better than any shoe I have ever wore, will not be disappointed. I have a wide toe, with high arch. Amazing...love!"
Asics,5,This shoe fits great!  It is just what I was looking for!
Asics,5,"This shoe fits my foot just right, this is the reason I buy them.  Asics is a good shoe if you have to stand all day.  It provides comfort, especially on the heel.  I have been buying these shoes for years and uses them for running and walking.  This is the best shoe for me.  I will continue to buy.  These shoes have excellent longevity."
Asics,5,This shoe fits very well and is very light weight. I was surprised how much support it has for my soles.
Asics,5,This shoe is a great fit. I have a high arch which sometimes is hard to find the right support. I can't wait to put some miles on these.
Asics,5,This shoe is a great walking shoe. It supports my arc and is breathable. I plan to get this same model when I wear my current ones out!
Asics,5,"This shoe is built for runners who supinate. I have suffered from plantar fasciitis from time to time, but the stability and wide toe box of this shoe really helps. Size was true to fit."
Asics,5,This shoe is comfortable and perfect for working out or running. Lots of support for all my exercise activities
Asics,5,"This shoe is cozy,and fits great, look great. Slick on metal stairs but great shoes"
Asics,5,This shoe is exactly what I was looking for and is very comfortable for walking and fit standing on your feet all day long. I will buy this shoe again.
Asics,5,This shoe is extremely comfortable and supportive. Asic makes the perfect shoe for people with foot and ankle ailments.
Asics,5,This shoe is perfect for my three to four times workout on my treadmill. Very comfortable and it gives my flat foot right support.
Asics,5,This shoe is so light weight and comfortable.  I love it.  I would definitely recommend purchasing it if you are on the fence.
Asics,5,"This shoe is very beautiful, I love the color, feel and just the right size."
Asics,5,This shoe is very comfortable.  Good support.
Asics,5,This shoe is very comfortable. Good for walking but weightlifting and cycling. I like it because it supports my flat feet. It has adequate thick soles. I hope they come out with some good colors.
Asics,5,"This shoe performs perfectlu.  I love the fit - its true to size, so if you wear a 9 order a 9.  It's so comfortable.  Before I was having heel pain that had me limping around the house, and on walks with my dog.  The durable cushioning makes me feel like I'm walking on air.  I'll probably buy another pair within 6 months because I want to have a pair to switch out so they will last.  I love walking in this shoe.  Exceptional value.  The prise is great too!"
Asics,5,This shoe provides good support and fits very well. I have had a very difficult time finding one that offers any support. I do KB and it really helps if your shoe fits snug and the material is not soft as in most shoes. I have added an insole and that gives me a little more cushion on the bottom. I would highly recommend this shoe. The price is really good too. 👍🏻👍🏻
Asics,5,This shoe seems to run small.  My daughter normally wears a 9 and we had to return and the 10 fits great
Asics,5,"This shoe was recommended by my physical therapist for a lower back problem. I usually walk several miles a day, so I order one size larger since my toes are always pounding against the end of the shoes as I walk up and down hills.

Recently I walked 4 miles down a steep mountain trail from a ski lift on a rocky trail and these shoes felt great and stable. I wear a thick low cut Thor Lo sock to make up for the size difference.

I highly recommend these shoes, and for the price I just ordered another pair to have on hand!"
Asics,5,This shoe was surprisingly comfortable. the inside cushion or sole bed was really thick compared to the running shoe and the hiking tread was really awesome. After wearing it a day or two it really fit better. Highly recommend this shoe. I think I might buy another pair.
Asics,5,"This shoes fits great! It is NOT black and silver, it is blue and silver. The box it comes in says black and silver but it is blue. You can look at the picture and see that it is blue."
Asics,5,"This sneaker is very comfortable and it run true to size, and it's a great walking shoes, very well made."
Asics,5,This sneaker shoe fits my narrow width but allows enough space for the front of my shoe.Fits
Asics,5,"This sneakers are exactly what is shown in the picture & it is 100% right on the size, mine is 8.5. Happy with my purchase."
Asics,5,This the fourth pair that I have. They are great!!
Asics,5,"This was a gift and very much appreciated. It’s the same model and size as one she already has, just a different color."
Asics,5,This was a gift for my Granddaughter and she lives in another state so I am not sure how they are.
Asics,5,This was a good purchase and perfect fit with support.
Asics,5,"This was a re-order because I love these ASICS shoes. They are lightweight but still provide support (especially side to side, which with too much mesh doesn't work). I wear them for exercise, when I'm going to be standing a lot and running errands."
Asics,5,"Though advertised as being ""Ortholite"" the support is not as good previously purchased ""Ortholite"" shoes."
Asics,5,Todo
Asics,5,Todo bien excelente servicio
Asics,5,Toe box just wide enough
Asics,5,Took a couple days to break in but WOW! These are wonderful for back and leg support during work hours. Im on my feet alot at work and ive noticed a huge relief in the pain in my lower back and legs/feet.  Would recommend for anyone on their feet 8+ hrs.
Asics,5,Took a little longer to get.  This is my 3 pair!  They wear well for miles and miles.
Asics,5,"Took a second to get broken in, but very comfortable and supportive.
Highly recommend."
Asics,5,"Totally love these shoes! They look very stylish and very comfortable with a gel insole. These are great for running, walking or if your going to be on your feet all day. One of the most comfortable tennis shoes I have ever bought."
Asics,5,"Tried different trail shoes, nothing comes close to ASICS. I love that this shoe like all ASICS have very thick soft fabric all around my foot. The tongue is so soft, I don’t feel the shoelace on top of my foot like I did when I tried Hokas and new balance. Same goes for the heel of the shoe, extra padded, great stability. I’m staying with ASICS  for my road running and trail running shoes!"
Asics,5,True fit. I work 12 hour shifts and ASICS have never let me down in comfort.
Asics,5,True to Asics size! Comfy. Love the colors.
Asics,5,True to fit
Asics,5,"True to fit, I have a wide foot and they fit perfectly, love the color, it more a deep blue/purple instead of black, was hesitant until I saw them in the store (didn't have my size). Comfortable, wish the arch was just a bit higher (I have high arches) but the are certainly not flat. Would definitely recommend and buy another pair."

Asics,5,worth the money to get quality shoes
Asics,5,would highly recommend
Asics,5,"Yep yep yep!! Finally the search is over! I have fussy feet with a high arch, and need quality heel absorption. I have looked all over, and tried a few different brands, and these are the ones I stuck with. Very comfortable, nice and snug so feet don’t rub around while walking or hiking, but not too snug. No blisters, no breaking in, just comfy right from the get go. So happy to find such comfy shoes without having to sacrifice style. Give these a try around the house, and send back if you’re not satisfied, but I hope you’re as happy as I am and can stop looking."
Asics,5,"You need to buy a half size up for Asics run small.  If you are not going to wear any type of socks, you should be fine, but just a suggestion for those that do wear socks."
Asics,5,👍
Asics,5,😁
New_Balance,5,"""Perfect fit and the lightest shoe ever,"" my daughter declares. So happy with this purchase."
New_Balance,5,"*update* Bought a second pair in black cuz I love these so much.

These are extremely comfortable and I really like the look as well. They are low profile so you can go with or without socks."
New_Balance,5,"*Update* I wore these NB shoes on concrete for five months and bought another pair. Pictures compare the worn and new shoes.

I didn’t realize this was the type of shoe that can be slid off and on without having to tie. The tongue is sewn in. Although I didn’t think I would ever like this design, it’s actually comfy and not loose on my feet."
New_Balance,5,:)
New_Balance,5,"+-  great shoes! I bought size 7.5 which is my normal size but my right foot was too tight. So I returned it and bought size 8.

+ great light shoes
+ know that it is clothe like so it can get dirty
》Overall, nice pair of shoes. I can't wait to walk towards success with these!"
New_Balance,5,"+Half size up. And it would be perfect
Super light weight bought it for exercise . so far so great"
New_Balance,5,2nd pair because we love them
New_Balance,5,2nd pair I’ve bought. This time in a different color. The material is a bit different depending on the color style you choose but overall they’re comfy for everyday use. The shoes are flexible in front which is nice for people with bunion or similar issues. Downside is that you have to double knot the laces because they slip undone easily.
New_Balance,5,"2nd pair of these shoes. I work in medical field and they are soooo comfortable and cute. I get compliments on them often because of how they fit and what the expose ankle wise. Look perfect with my cropped scrubs (I work in a plastics office).
The only reason I have purchased a second pair now is because I wear them ALLLLL the time and they get worn down from work."
New_Balance,5,A fantastic fit. I have semi wide feet and its roomy without being a big shoe. Super light! and soft. I think I found a favorite shoe. Never had one before.
New_Balance,5,"A few years ago, I was hit by a speeding truck; it was unclear whether I would ever walk, comfortably, again. Every shoe posed some problem, like a blister forming on my toe, or some other discomfort, but these shoes fit incredibly comfortably! I do use one lift, in my affected leg, but I’m walking five miles per day with no pain! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
New_Balance,5,A good shoe for running around in!
New_Balance,5,A great shoe for a great price. Comfy and lightweight.
New_Balance,5,A little beefier support would be nice. I added Dr Schoals sport & now they are great! I average 16000 steps a day!
New_Balance,5,"A little difficult to pull on, but fit well and are comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"A little less room length wise than I’d like, but a good sneaker to wear on casual days or lifting days at the gym."
New_Balance,5,A little small
New_Balance,5,A little smaller than I expected for my size but not enough to return. If I wore them all day it might hurt my feet. You might want to order a half size bigger
New_Balance,5,"A little snug but very nice.
Lightweight."
New_Balance,5,Absolute love these. It’s my second pair. My only complaint is the insoles get weird after they have been washed
New_Balance,5,"Absolutely feels like walking on air. I’m on my feet most of the day and have plantar fasciitis & it helps so much! I love that they go with any outfit, are super lightweight & flexible."
New_Balance,5,Absolutely gorgeous and comfortable shoes!! I have two of these kind but in different colors. The first gray shoes fits jut right and I’m a size 6. The white ones is 1/2 size smaller but I’m sure it’ll give in time. The toe area has a lot of room. I have a high arch and these shoes gives the support I need through out a 10 hour work period.
New_Balance,5,Absolutely love these shoes and the price! They are very comfortable
New_Balance,5,Absolutely love these shoes! I work in a kitchen and they are super comfy. Plus I love the cute cheetah print!
New_Balance,5,"Absolutely LOVE these shoes, I bought the rose pink in my true size, got them and they are a little snug. Next purchase I bought a half size up and they fit great. Love the sleek look, not too bulky and not too heavy either. I wear them to work when I’m going to be on my feet all day and don’t come home with sore toes. Highly recommend these shoes!"
New_Balance,5,Absolutely love these shoes. I have brought two pairs. One pair for work (I’m a nurse) and one paint for walking
New_Balance,5,"Absolutely love these shoes. They are not for people with wide/fat feet though. At first I thought they would be too small but after wearing them for an hour they became my favorite shoes hands down. They form to your feet perfectly. I plan on getting another pair in a different color. Also true to size, definitely don’t size down."
New_Balance,5,Absolutely love these sneakers! Super comfortable and trendy to wear whether for the gym or for just dressing down for the day!
New_Balance,5,Absolutely love these! I have a wider foot and these babies fit very true to size ❤️
New_Balance,5,Absolutely love these! Needed a good pair of black gym shoes to go with my scrubs and something that was comfy to walk in. These did just that! Not only was the price great but the quality is too. I was also looking for a light weight gym show which this did not disappoint on. Would highly recommend
New_Balance,5,"Absolutely love these! So much in fact that I had to order a second pair. Lightweight, moderate support, and very fashionable. I love them!"
New_Balance,5,Absolutely love this gym shoes. They are so comfortable! It feels like Im not wearing anything on my feet. Love the fit as well.
New_Balance,5,"Absolutely love this shoe. Lightweight, easily adjustable. You feel like you are training on air."
New_Balance,5,"Absolutely love this shoes. Considering buying a second pair!

Don’t recommend using them for running. They’re not the most supportive, but they’re good if you’re just doing a quick, body weight workout or lifting.

Very comfy and stylish."
New_Balance,5,Absolutely perfect and comfortable
New_Balance,5,"Absolutely perfect fit, most comfortable shoe ever!!!!"
New_Balance,5,Adorable
New_Balance,5,Adorable.  Runs a little narrow and would suggest 1/2 size larger
New_Balance,5,After blowing out the back of my Nike shoes in two months (really??) I ordered shoes because I was out of town during Covid and walking 4-8 miles per day on steep hills. Comfort and support were a priority. This shoe did not disappoint. I originally ordered a half size bigger different model from DSW and returned them as heel sliding and I am a full size 10. These size 10 shoes are spot on and roomy in the toe box. Feels like a feather on my feet and I love love love them. Let's see if they hold up! To be continued...
New_Balance,5,After buying these shoes and reading lots of reviews I decided to wear them to Zumba for a while then write my review.  Some reviews said they were too tight and I usually have toe box issues.  In my opinion they are a snug fit because the fabric is much lighter and more flexible than traditional training shoes.  The snug fit gives your foot the support it needs and is not at all uncomfortable. Needless to say they are working out very well for me. They are holding up well to a high intensity workout too.
New_Balance,5,"After getting one pair that was too small (ordered my actual size and didn’t take the advice of the entire amazon and order up)  and one pair that was completely not what I ordered, the third pair is perfect!!! I love them  and can’t wait to wear them at Disney. They are super lightweight. And absolutely Order a half a ize up!!!! Definitely not running shoes! By the by, the company was excellent in the returns."
New_Balance,5,"After one week of wearing these shoes, I realized how badly I have been hurting my feet with cheap brands for years. I am on constantly on my feet working 14 hrs a day, 5-6 days a week- it’s nice to come home without having a sore lower back or sore feet."
New_Balance,5,"After reading many positive reviews and seeing how popular this shoe was, I decided to go with New Balance.  The shoes are feather light with excellent arch and heel support and plenty of room for your toes to move freely.  Will definitely buy another pair."
New_Balance,5,"After reading the reviews and everyone saying they run small, and ordered one size up, I went back and forth on whether I should order one size bigger or just ordering in my size but wide.  I decided on ordering my size 8.5W instead of going a size up, glad I did!  My feet run more on the narrow side and ordering in wide they fit perfect and comfortable."
New_Balance,5,After reading the reviews I went up half a size.  Fit perfectly
New_Balance,5,"After wearing them for a couple week, I like them a lot."
New_Balance,5,"Ajuste perfecto en lo referente a la puntera y el ancho, muy buen soporte del arco para caminar (9 Km tres veces por semana); para mí está perfecto. New Balance es mi marca desde hace más de 15 años."
New_Balance,5,"All boxes are checked on this one. The size, style, fabric is all as ordered. They look great and fit perfect."
New_Balance,5,"Alright I’m obsessed with the shoes. I’m 34 and too tired to wear uncomfortable shoes. But I still like cute stuff while I’m at the gym or running errands 🤔 so what’s a girl to do? I now have three pairs Of these. I have a grey pair for every day, and a blue/gold and pink pair for the gym. I’ve had my first two pairs for a year now and just bought my 3rd. I have two crappy knees, one from a small meniscus tear and one from a fractured patella (both healed but still causing chronic pain). I do mostly cross training type stuff at the gym. For cardio rarely I run, usually bike, elliptical, or rowing machine. But these shoes are super comfy for all of those activities. They don’t have a big heel so they don’t tip me forward, making my form better for squats and deadlifts Which is important so that I don’t screw up my knees. The light colors stain easily, some wash out some not so I might consider buying a dark color or spraying them with some sort of protectant spray. My Navy blue ones with the gold strip appear to be out of production but if you find any with that metallic look down the side, I found them to run smaller than the others and sized up a half size. I bought my pink ones and metallic ones at exactly the same time in a shoe store and there was a clear difference. You will not regret this purchase. Seriously these shoes are the best. Good luck!"
New_Balance,5,Amazing fit. Sooo  comfortable and soft. I'm a nurse and I wear them with compression socks and my feet don't feel achy and tired when I get home. I reccomend these shoes to my co workers and those who are usually on their feet all day.
New_Balance,5,"Amazing shoe! Super comfortable, great fit, first slip on that my foot actually fit in and they weren't painful totally worth the money."
New_Balance,5,"Amazing shoe! Versatile. Flat and form-fitting. Great for running, rowing, lifting and jumping. I have already purchased these same shoes in 2 other colors."
New_Balance,5,"Amazing value, super comfy."
New_Balance,5,Amazing value. Comfortable and for daily use. They go with lots of different things
New_Balance,5,"Amazing walking and casual shoes. I wouldn't use for exercising as the heel is too loose for that, except maybe just simple stationery strength training. Unbelievably comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"Amazing walking shoe. Best ones I’ve purchased yet. They have exceeded expectations, and who would believe that mesh tennis shoes would be waterproof?! Definitely will purchase again."
New_Balance,5,Amazing!
New_Balance,5,"Amazing! Wide foot girl here, Nike’s and Nobulls are no good for me. These were perfect! Just wide enough to be comfortable and enough support. SUPER light too. These are perfect for these new WFH days where you can go from a long walk to parading from your desk to kitchen and around the house at ease. True to size!"
New_Balance,5,"Amazingly comfortable!!! I normally wear a size 7.5, but in tennis shoes I have to get a size 8."
New_Balance,5,Amazingly light shoes. I work 10+ hours on my feet and these have helped tremendously. No more sore feet. They’re also really low key and cute. About to buy a second pair!
New_Balance,5,Are you on the fence?  BUY THEM! omg like walking on clouds. These came in and I walked around DC for a week and they were so comfortable. I cannot rave about them enough. I wear them all the time (purchased 6 months ago).
New_Balance,5,As advertised. Very comfortable. What young lady (67) doesn’t need a pair of pink tennis shoes
New_Balance,5,As per the prev reviews I ordered a size 7 I’m usually a size 6.5. I should of ordered a 6.5 as the 7 fit a bit off however the shoe itself is most comfortable
New_Balance,5,"As someone who has wider feet, these shoes fit perfectly. The insoles are so comfy and I do not feel fatigued after standing at work for 8+ hours"
New_Balance,5,"As soon as I received my New Balance FuelCore Nergize sneakers I put them on. They had just enough give, in all the right places, so that my wide feet felt very comfortable. I was worried they wouldn’t have enough structure to them but my feet were getting a nice supportive hug. I love the color and style. They don’t look like your average sneaker and that’s a good thing. These shoes are casual but I don’t look like I’m going jogging even when paired with a tee and jogger sweats. At 61 I don’t think I could fool anyone into thinking that anyway lol. They’ll look great with joggers, jeans, capris, shorts, and anything else I pair them with. These shoes are almost like a slip on but the laces do help tighten them up if you need too. These are a great, casual, comfortable, stylish pair of sneakers and at a good price. This just might be my new pair of everyday-go-to sneakers."
New_Balance,5,"at first glance these do not look well made and they are very light.
But they are so comfortable. the arch support is great, the holes in the side are amazing my feet get hot quickly and I am so happy to have a vent on the sides. the color is great black goes with everything. Love them!"
New_Balance,5,"Avid runner here! If you love light, gel-like, form fitted running shoes, stop right here and click “buy now”. These shoes are awesome and I’m honestly so impressed with how well they have held up. These shoes have over 400 running miles on them and have carried me through snow, ice, torrential downpours, and 100+ degree heat. I even wore these for a half marathon and had absolutely no issues. These are excellent shoes with a great price tag!"
New_Balance,5,Awesome fit!! These shoes are Super comfortable. I’m a nurse and stand on my feet most of the day and was in the market for a new pair of sneakers. I’ve had them for about 2 weeks now and so far so good. I ordered my normal shoe size in a Wide and it feels wonderful!!!
New_Balance,5,Awesome shoes but for sure go a size larger cuz they are not true to the size. I'm a size 7 in any brand but these I have to buy again because they're way to small. But definitely cute
New_Balance,5,Awesome shoes!
New_Balance,5,Awesome shoes! Literally feel like I'm walking on a cloud! The cushion in the shoe sole is like a tempurpedic pillow. I think the laces could be improved but overall love these!
New_Balance,5,Awesome shoes.
New_Balance,5,"Awesome sneaker fits true to size, so comfortable I just had to buy another pair. Great buy and great service, Thanks ☮️"
New_Balance,5,Awesomw
New_Balance,5,"Based on reviews, I sized up to an 8.5 because I have wide feet (I'm usually a 7.5) and these fit perfectly. I usually have a really hard time finding sneakers that don't hurt the balls of my feet, but these are incredibly comfortable and I could wear them all day. The padding inside is supportive and forms to your feet. The upper part of the shoe is a made of a thin and lightweight material that moves with your foot and doesn't dig in at all. I mainly purchased these to workout in, but they are also pretty versatile to wear out and can make an outfit look casual/minimal."
New_Balance,5,Beautiful and comfortable. Wouldn’t recommend for running or hard core work out but wonderful for being on feet all day and walking.
New_Balance,5,Beautiful shoe.  This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves them.  They look great.
New_Balance,5,"Been using old sneakers to exercise, these are comfortable & better support"
New_Balance,5,"Besides it gettin dirty because i choose the white/grey color, they are very comfortable!! & fit perfect i have 9 - 9 1/2 ft and i got 9 they are great i got them 10months ago"
New_Balance,5,Best find and easy matchable with clothes
New_Balance,5,"Best purchase ever! They were sold as used, but they still had all the tags!!  Unbelievable price!!"
New_Balance,5,"Best shoe for working long shifts on your feet, so lightweight and sleek. I had to size up a full size in black knit material. Normally I wear a (6) but in Nike and this shoe I took a (6.5) in the light grey color but in black I took a (7).  I wore the back out of my grey pair and washed them a dozen times before replacing them with black.  This is the only shoe I worked 12 hour shifts in and not had foot pain or any blistering and discomfort, great work shoe."
New_Balance,5,Best shoes ever
New_Balance,5,Best shoes ever!
New_Balance,5,Best shoes ever!!! I stand in surgery all day and my feet never feel fatigue in these.
New_Balance,5,Best shoes for the price. Super comfortable. I wear them daily and work walking.
New_Balance,5,"Best shoes I have worn in a while! I’m a nurse and I have wide feet, so I am always looking for a comfy pair of shoes for work. I even bought a 2nd pair!"
New_Balance,5,Best tennis shoes I’ve ever bought! They’re very comfortable and durable. I’ve had mine for almost a year and they’re still in great condition. I’ll definitely be buying these again in the future!
New_Balance,5,Best walking shoe ever!
New_Balance,5,Best wife and comfortable shoe I’ve ever had. Soft in the toes and great lightweight shoe.
New_Balance,5,Better than expected super comfortable
New_Balance,5,Better than I expected. Super comfortable and light. Bottom is thick enough for rough walking trails. Would buy again.
New_Balance,5,Bought a 1/2 size bigger love the way they look and very comfortable
New_Balance,5,Bought a half size up based on previous reviews. They are extremely comfortable and a good price. I love these.
New_Balance,5,Bought a pair of these a year ago or so and they were getting worn out so I had to buy another. Love these shoes! Only wore this pair a few times so far but just as amazing as the first and so comfortable to wear.
New_Balance,5,Bought as a gift for my mother’s bday & she loves them and say they are extremely comfortable and wears them on walks and during exercise! Look great too in my opinion cute & sporty.
New_Balance,5,Bought for a gift and they love them!
New_Balance,5,"Bought for granddaughter, who works for a doctor. She loves them."
New_Balance,5,Bought for my daughter who is a nurse she loves them
New_Balance,5,Bought for my mom after she had ordered a half size smaller (her typical size) but those were too small. She had me order these in the next size up and they fit well.
New_Balance,5,Bought for my Mom. She loves them!
New_Balance,5,Bought for my wife and she loves them.

New_Balance,5,Bought them as a gift for my wife. She loves the fit and comfort.
New_Balance,5,Bought these for a birthday gift for my daughter. She is crazy about Disney aside from that she said they are the most comfortable shoes she has had for work. I’m
New_Balance,5,Bought these for basic use. They are comfortable for day to day use. I have walked 2+ miles in these & my feet are good. Would buy another pair.
New_Balance,5,"Bought these for long walks and they hold up well and are comfortable. I usually wear a 6.5 or 7, and ordered the 7 bases on everyone else’s reviews; however I should’ve listened to everyone else as I had to send them back and get a half size bigger."
New_Balance,5,Bought these for my daughter for her birthday. Leopard print adds to the appearance of the shoe. Good fit
New_Balance,5,"Bought these for my fiance for Christmas and she Loves Them!!!  I also got her 4 other pairs of Fuelcore Nergize shoes, just in different colors to match other outfits, but she says these are her favorite.  She loves the purple/lavender & said these are actually more comfortable & fit better than her others (even though they're all the same size, just different colors) *Fuelcore Nergize are the only shoes she really likes to wear anymore bc of how comfortable they are for her. (Guess I'll have to try out the Men's equivalent version of them sometime, if they exist?)"
New_Balance,5,"Bought these for my mom because she’s on her feet a lot where she works and this is her texted response:

“They’re as comfortable as wearing slippers; but acceptable enough to enjoy in public.”"
New_Balance,5,Bought these for my mom.  She loves them and hasn’t stopped wearing them
New_Balance,5,"Bought These For My Mother, She Needed A Comfortable, Light Weight Shoe And This Did It For Her.
No Complaints, Thank God.
I Would Definitely Buy Them For Her Again When The Time Comes."
New_Balance,5,"Bought these for my wife and the comfort, fit, and lightness make them her favorite tennis shoes of all time."
New_Balance,5,"Bought these for my wife for Christmas.  She loves them and said they are super comfortable, and you can’t go wrong with leopard print"
New_Balance,5,"Bought these for our babymoon as we were going to be walking a ton and being 6.5 months pregnant, I needed the most comfortable shoes available. Glad to say these were great! We walked an average of 5 miles a day (a lot uphill!) and these were amazing. I never felt any pain or discomfort. Highly recommend!"
New_Balance,5,"Bought these for work as I am on my feet most of the day. These feel like they were made for my feet. Lightweight, comfortable"
New_Balance,5,"Bought these for working as a waitress. They are comfy, lightweight and stylish. Only issue is I wish I would've ordered a half size larger, they seem to run slightly small."
New_Balance,5,"Bought these shoes and normally wear a 9. I also have nb sneakers in 9 and the fit is great. However, I ordered these in 9 and it was narrow and small. I exchanged for a 10 wide and love these! They are so comfy and soft and look great!!!"
New_Balance,5,Bought these shoes for wearing to work.  Love the roomy toe box.  I'm very happy so far and I've already bought another pair!!!!!
New_Balance,5,Bought these to workout in. I should have gotten a 1/2 size bigger for swelling during workout. My fault...they fit perfectly for everyday wear. I'm just particular about my feet while I workout due to an injury to my right foot/ankle. I will be buying at least one more pair in a half size bigger as well as another color. My foot is 9 inches from heel to toe. I purchased a size 8.
New_Balance,5,Bought this pair for better half. She can get over how light and comfortable they are plus has great grip.  Gets complements from workout group. Bought her two more.
New_Balance,5,"bought this shoe, i love it. it just perfect fir and support to my feet."
New_Balance,5,Box arrived mangled wrapped with packing tape with no lid but these were for me personally so I didn’t mind. These shoes are probably the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. Color is true to pic. Love them!
New_Balance,5,"Breatheable and comfortable, just what I like on a pair of shoes!"
New_Balance,5,"Buena calidad, muy comodo y buen precio"
New_Balance,5,"Buy these shoes! I have never gotten more compliments on my shoes as I do with these at the gym! And they are super comfortable- I can wear them for a Bootcamp class and for running and they perform great.
I was worried as I purchased the white ones, due to fear of it getting really dingy looking - but I’ve had them for 4 months and finally threw them in the wash and they wash well, look brand new! Even so I bought another pair just in case, and a black one to add.. a testament to how much I love these shoes."
New_Balance,5,"By far my favorite pair of Tennis shoes. The inside is super soft but still supportive. I love that you don’t have to tie them. Just once and they slide on and off easily but are secure on your foot during wear.
Fit is absolutely perfect.
The majority of my family has switched from Nike to NB and we all LOVE them. 100% will be purchasing these again."
New_Balance,5,"Came in quickly, fit a little wider than expected but comfy and worth the money!"
New_Balance,5,"Can I just say, these are the comfiest shoes ever! The material is stretchy so my feet fit in comfortably. The bottom of the shoes are bouncy and soft. Perfect for walking or any type of cardio exercise."
New_Balance,5,Can never go too wrong with New Balance. Great Product. Hard to fit lady now smiling!
New_Balance,5,"Clearly looks like these are someone’s shoes they returned. Scuffed and have dog fur on them.. definitely not the $50 shoes I was hoping for. Will update after I receive a replacement..
Update-they sent replacement shoes and I’m happy they’re brand new and they fit great. Satisfied!"
New_Balance,5,"Clouds.

I work in a hospital, can't live without them."

New_Balance,5,Comfortable  from day one
New_Balance,5,Comfortable and cute! Love that I can slip them on and off. Great for walks
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable and easy to put on - what more would I need?  You can tighten the shoe with the laces, but once you have that set, there's elastic that allows you to just slip on and go!  Very pleased with this purchase."
New_Balance,5,Comfortable and fits perfect. I always go up 1/2 size with sneakers. This shoe looks sleek on the foot.
New_Balance,5,Comfortable and get compliments on them all the time. Bought a pair for myself and 1 for my sister in law. She loves them.
New_Balance,5,Comfortable and light weight. These are good walking shoes. I had to add arch support for my own feet but other than that they feel great
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable and lightweight, perfect to wear anytime and light enough to pack"
New_Balance,5,Comfortable and stylish!! Love them!
New_Balance,5,Comfortable and that don’t feel clunky on my size 9 feet.
New_Balance,5,Comfortable but the memory sole isnt as noticeable.  Feels like a regular tennis cushion m
New_Balance,5,Comfortable but very minimal arch support. I will likely need to buy inserts if I use these shoes for walking long distances.
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable enough, I’m on my feet all day at work. I do wear orthotics so I can’t answer anything about support but it’s a nice white shoe!"
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable for an 8hr work day and they look nice, add arch support for long days. Fit is as expected."
New_Balance,5,Comfortable shoe that’s true to size.
New_Balance,5,Comfortable shoe to work out in. Feels like I am walking on air.
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable shoe, just seems like it’s made cheaply. I just got mine and the loop on the back of one is already broken. The quality did not meet my expectations unfortunately."
New_Balance,5,Comfortable shoes
New_Balance,5,Comfortable shoes. Wear them every day.
New_Balance,5,Comfortable work out shoe
New_Balance,5,Comfortable yet supportive. Lightweight yet sturdy.
New_Balance,5,comfortable!
New_Balance,5,Comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable, cool, use them almost everyday"
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable, lightweight, a bit of stretch in the top lining."
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable, lightweight, supportive, and at the right price.  They fit as expected. I am an 8 1/2-9 wide and these fit me perfect."
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable, nice looking, easy to put on and lite feel:)"
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable, stretch, and breathable!
Love these shoes!"
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable, supportive, light weight.  Will be wearing on vacation."
New_Balance,5,"Comfortable. Not for walking or standing allllllll day long though. I do hair and my feet hurt at the end of the day with these, but I love them otherwise and wear them often"
New_Balance,5,Comfortably!
New_Balance,5,Comfy
New_Balance,5,Comfy and cute
New_Balance,5,Comfy and I love that you can slip these on!
New_Balance,5,Comfy and light weight!  Loving the cushioned sole.  I have a flat foot and it fit just right.
New_Balance,5,Comfy and lightweight. True to size. I would recommend these shoes to others any day.
New_Balance,5,Comfy and perfect slip on style.
New_Balance,5,Comfy shoes but not alot of arch support. Won't wear them to another Zumba class. More for leisure
New_Balance,5,"Comfy shoes, price was much less than local sporting goods store."
New_Balance,5,"Comfy, light weight and a steal for the price ! Great for walking/running. Would totally recommend to everyone."
New_Balance,5,"Comfy, lightweight would order again!"
New_Balance,5,Comfy. I have trouble with my heel hurting and these shoes helped so much!
New_Balance,5,Comfy. I love the style. I wear size 10 and the 10s fit perfect
New_Balance,5,Como esperaba! Super cómodos!
New_Balance,5,Comodos
New_Balance,5,"Considering these sneakers don't have any laces to really pull them on tight they are not needed. They stay in place while I walk, run, and dance in them. Light weight with great support. Easy to clean off and I've already gotten compliments. Great shoes for working out and for every day wear."
New_Balance,5,Could use more arch support
New_Balance,5,Cushioned walk!!!
New_Balance,5,Cute
New_Balance,5,Cute and comfortable
New_Balance,5,Cute and comfortable! Super light!
New_Balance,5,"Cute and comfortable. I am usually a 6.5, but they were too small. Definitely recommend sizing up a 1/2 size."
New_Balance,5,"Cute and comfortable. I wear them to the gym, and casually."
New_Balance,5,Cute comfortable shoe. A friend of mine had a pair & I had tried to find  pair just like. Thank goodness I found on Amazon exactly what I wanted.
New_Balance,5,Cute shoe with Minnie theming.  Just a little tight up at the toes.
New_Balance,5,Cute shoes. Extremely comfortable. I'm 45 and my daughter is 13. We both like to weat these. Great for any age!
New_Balance,5,Cute! Not for running but great for every day wear.
New_Balance,5,"Cute, really light, seem comfy.  A tiny bit snug so I need a really thin sock though.  This is the second pair I ordered.  A casual shoe that probably wouldn’t do well for serious walking but will work well for everyday wear."
New_Balance,5,"Cute.  Bought for travel to pull double duty as casual walking shoes that look decent with street clothes and for exercise.  I go for more stability in my running shoes, but they work fine for occasional exercise while traveling to minimize packing."
New_Balance,5,Cute. And very comfy for walking.
New_Balance,5,Daughter said comfortable and like color
New_Balance,5,"Deben comprar medio size más grande de su talla normal , me quedaron ajustados , es decir, mis dedos topan la parte de arriba del zapato y de tanto caminar duelen los dedos"
New_Balance,5,Definitely not  definitely not a qualitie sneaker
New_Balance,5,Definitely order a half size up.. I usually wear a 6.5 and was glad I purchased a 7 because they just fit! They are so comfortable to wear and to work out it!
New_Balance,5,Definitely size up half a size. I tried these on in a store prior to ordering and glad I did. Love the magnet grey with the rose gold accents. Super cute tennis shoe and very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"Definitely worth the buy, fit perfect, super comfy, super light, and has a really good grip."
New_Balance,5,Delighted with my shoes; I was able to remove exiting footbed and put in my custom orthotics. Shoes are lightweight and comfortable  - only wish I'd found them sooner. Thanks!
New_Balance,5,Demasiado cómodos...buena inversión
New_Balance,5,"Demasiado lindo este diseño de New Balance, lo tenía en rosa y decidí comprarlo en negro, demasiado cómodos. Por ser negros convinan con todo, me los lleve de vacaciones como mi único par de zapatos y me encantaron, pude correr con ellos porque no paré de hacer ejercicio, pero también eran perfectos para salidas casuales. El zapato hace que mi pie se vea delicado."
New_Balance,5,did not dislike anything the shoe was great
New_Balance,5,Do yourself a favor and purchase these.  It's like walking on clouds.  These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.
New_Balance,5,Ease of having a slip on sneaker.  It is a very comfortable shoe.
New_Balance,5,"Easy on, easy off, lightest sneakers I’ve ever worn! These are super light sneakers with memory foam padding, making them perfect for treadmill and around the house use. The top is a cooling mesh fabric, which I hope is more durable than the last pair I had. They lasted a year before replacing."
New_Balance,5,"Easy to get on, looks good on the foot and really comfortable"
New_Balance,5,Easy to put on. Very fashionable
New_Balance,5,"Edit:Giving this product 5 stars because the 8.5 fits great and is SUPER comfy at work.

These are a great and comfortable shoe, but they were not true to size. I wear a womens size 8 and the ones I got squished my toes and they were very uncomfortable to wear at work. I have ordered an 8.5 and am going to see how that goes. Hopefully they'll fit the way I want and my toes wont be squished! Love the shoe besides that, though!"
New_Balance,5,"Elegant, and perfectly form-fitting, they exceeded my expectations! The ONLY thing that could make them better is if you gave me the $10.- coupon you promised me for shopping in apparel!"
New_Balance,5,"Esperaba que fuera mas ancho en la puntera me quedan, me gustaron mucho la verdad y super comodos"
New_Balance,5,Están hermosas muy contenta me quedaron u poco justas pero están lindas
New_Balance,5,"Estos tenis son lo mas comodo del mundo. No pesan y se camina muy bien con ellos, los recomiendo a todos"
New_Balance,5,"Estos Zapatos deportivos los envié a mi país de origen y me dijeron que eran espectaculares, suaves y livianos, muy cómodos.. Los recomiendo!"
New_Balance,5,"Even though there were no tag on the shoes i bought, couldn’t beat the price"
New_Balance,5,Every Disney lover must have these shoes. Super comfortable from the minute I put them on. This is my first pair of New Balance and they fit true to size. Can't wait to be able to wear these to the park.
New_Balance,5,"Everyday wear, the shoe is just a little wide in the middle where you tie the laces"
New_Balance,5,"Everything about the seller was great—response to order, speed in shipping, etc.  I like the color but I think NB has changed its size/width template, so buyers be sure you get shoes big enough.  I usually wear a 2AA but this is a B and feels like a 2AA."
New_Balance,5,Everything about this shoe is good. Easy to slip on and off
New_Balance,5,Everything was perfect just runs about a half size small also super comfortable my mom really liked them for work...
New_Balance,5,"Exactly what I wanted and expected!  Light weight, great support, perfect color as indicated in color chart. I did however choose to purchase a 1/2size larger than I normally would because I knew I would be doing LOTS of walking and I wanted plenty toe room👍🏼"
New_Balance,5,Exactly what I was expecting
New_Balance,5,"Exactly what I was looking for- low price, quality, comfort, and style. The cushion inserts are very comfortable and supportive. Thin shoes so your feet will get wet quickly in the rain and i quickly “wore them in” as they were tight at first but quickly stretched which is why I went 0.5 size smaller than my usual size. Due to this, I feel they might wear out quicker than the typical gym shoe (we’ll see!). So far very satisfied wearing them in the gym."
New_Balance,5,Excelente
New_Balance,5,Excelente
New_Balance,5,Excelente

New_Balance,5,"Extremely comfortable , lightweight , I was worried they would look cheaply made due to not very expensive but they are worth it ."
New_Balance,5,Extremely comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"Extremely comfortable, but they do run about a half size too small. Once on, you forget you had them on!"
New_Balance,5,Extremely comfy and great work shoes
New_Balance,5,"Fantastic shoe! I wore them all around Germany and didn't have any issues. I did need to switch to shoes with extra arch support for the long hike/walk days, but for the most part these were perfect for flat ground. They're also great with skinny jeans, which most athletic shoes are not. So happy to have found these!"
New_Balance,5,Fast delivery and comfortable shoes
New_Balance,5,Fav works shoes. I run a dental office all day and these are my fav go to shoes for comfort. Bought another pair in diff colors for back up. Absolutely love them.
New_Balance,5,"Favorite gym shoe. Supportive, comfortable, and flattering."
New_Balance,5,Favorite pair of everyday sneakers. I have them in four colors. Very lightweight and comfortable for eve easy wear and running.
New_Balance,5,"Favorite pair of leisure shoes! Originally bought them for my mom but kept them for myself and bought her another pair :)
I have wide feet and these are so comfy and roomy. They fit a little loose but I wear thin no-show socks, so that could be the reason but it isn’t awkward or slip off. Fit is actually perfect. Get lots of compliments when I wear them and goes with anything!"
New_Balance,5,Favorite shoes ever!  So light weight!
New_Balance,5,Favorite shoes! Love the fit
New_Balance,5,Feels great
New_Balance,5,"Feels great, like walking on air."
New_Balance,5,Feels like walking barefoot.  Best shoe I purchased in a long time.  Looking at other colors now.
New_Balance,5,Feels like walking on a cloud
New_Balance,5,"Feels like walking on a cloud! I ordered a half size up, as recommended by reviewers..but really didn't have to! This is the first shoe I wore out of the box for two straight days! Normally I have to give new sneakers a break! Not these! I wore them running errands, visiting the doctor, and walking the dog! They feel great!"
New_Balance,5,Feels like walking on air! Comfortable shoe!
New_Balance,5,Feels super soft while giving me the confidence of support while walking.
New_Balance,5,Felt slightly tight on top of my foot but stretched out and fits like a glove! Needed new shoes for my pregnant feet!
New_Balance,5,"Felt very lightweight, comfortable from day one and the quality was spot on! I am a nurse and these shoes held up to the test!"
New_Balance,5,Finally a pair of shoes that I feel good it at work!! These shoes are so lightweight & comfortable- definitely a great pair!
New_Balance,5,"Finally a show that fits my wide feet. Very comfortable, I wear it all of the time when working out! If you have wide feet, these are the shoes for you. I bought them in every color. I wear a 10wide."
New_Balance,5,Finally found a shoe that feels like I'm barefoot! Light but supportive. My new favorite for workouts!
New_Balance,5,Finally! A shoe that is wide enough in the toe box that I have no pain! I love the look and feel of these shoes.
New_Balance,5,First I ordered these in my regular shoe size and I found them too tight. I reordered and sized up a half size. Perfect. These are super comfortable right out of the box. No breaking in like some sneakers I have purchased. These are very light and feel fantastic on my feet.
New_Balance,5,"First of all, these shoes are really comfortable! I absolutely love them.
I was worried about ordering true size as other reviews recommend to size up, I still took the risk and I don't regret. I'm wondering if the people that recommended to size up they like shoes to fit loose instead of about right.
If you you don't require wide shoes then order normal size. If you have a wider foot then size up.
In conclusion,  all I can say is you won't regret such a comfortable, multi-purpose shoes."
New_Balance,5,First off I have to say I was sold on the gold accent on this shoe before even trying it on.  I actually purchased a pair and nordstrom rack and then discovered that it was being sold cheaper on Amazon.  This shoe is very comfortable.  I walked around the National Mall for about 5 hours and had no pain or fatigue.
New_Balance,5,"First pair of black tennis shoes that I have owned in my life, and I'm 52, and I love them!!!! I wear them to work, and I work 16 hour shifts 4 days a week.  And on my feet, Healthcare  workers that are good at their job do not get to sit around!!!"
New_Balance,5,First time o bought this brand I wanna surprise I love it specially at my job I have to walk a lot and this shoes really comfortable love it
New_Balance,5,"First time wearing them today... Very comfy, no issues. I'm a preschool teacher who runs, jumps, and actively plays all day and I completely forgot I was wearing brand new shoes today until the Amazon reminder to review them popped up."
New_Balance,5,Fit and wore right out of the box with no problems. Nice shoe.
New_Balance,5,Fit as expected but size up
New_Balance,5,Fit as expected. Bought these in place of my other new balances for work and they’re so light weight and comfortable. I got a 9.5 which is what I usually wear
New_Balance,5,"Fit great, very comfortable"
New_Balance,5,Fit is good
New_Balance,5,Fit perfectly
New_Balance,5,Fit perfectly and are very comfortable!
New_Balance,5,Fit perfectly and is very comfortable! I normally wear 10 in women's tennis shoes and that is exactly what I ordered.

New_Balance,5,"Fit was good, alittle snug but ok.an very lightweight an comfy!!"
New_Balance,5,Fit well and very comfy
New_Balance,5,"Fit
Fit as expected, based on an informed decision:
If you have never been fit for running shoes before, you may be disappointed. It is definitely worthwhile to stop by your local running shoe store and be fit; stores do this for free, or try on New Balance in similar styles to the shoe you wish to purchase. I strongly  suggest at minimum using the sizing tool on the New Balance website. You can compare the fit of your current brand to New Balance sizes.

I ordered a size 11 and usually wear size 10 dress shoe or sandal. I wear size 11 Mizunos for running, which the New Balance website converted to a 10.5. However, I like a roomy fit in the toes and ordered an 11 base on other reviews. Had I ordered a 10.5, I would have found them a bit small because the 11 is perfect.

They are snug and could almost be worn without socks. Although I look like I have cankles in the picture, I actually have narrow ankles. The sides of my foot are displayed by the very low-profile sides and require low socks, but do not curve in on the back of the ankle and cut like some other low-profile shoes. The are very light and the insole is nicely padded, not squishy like some memory foam shoes, but very comfortable.

Look
The sides over the arch are lighter mesh than the rest of the shoe body. The red bad is loose and does scrunch up a bit when tying, which is my only criticism. The colors are as pictured. The dots are actually divits under the white mesh. The end of the laces are trimmed with red and the inside of the shoe has the classic Minnie red with white polk-a-dots. The Minnie bow is metal, of good quality and painted nicely.

Presentation & delivery
Because these shoes are in high demand, I had to wait until they were available to order. Once available, they shipped and arrived in Prime time. The box is also attractive, as to be expected from Disney and a nice bonus from New Balance.

Overall
These are a must for Disney Parks visitors and Disney fans alike. I am very excited to wear these on my next visit to the parks. They are comfortable and attractive. They are lightweight and will look good with shorts or pants. I would have been really disappointed  had I ordered the wrong size and had to wait forever to exchange them due to the high demand. I am so glad that I investigated my size."

New_Balance,5,"Good fit, super comfortable. Just a tad too large, but probably my own fault for ordering a wide width. Nothing that couldn't be fixed by tightening the laces a bit. Also my first time wearing New Balance, so not familiar with how they run.  But overall, really comfortable shoe. I love it!"
New_Balance,5,"Good fit. True to size.  So comfortable that I ordered another pair in grey.  I use them for Mixxedfit workouts, and they are very good cross trainers."

New_Balance,5,Gorgeous sneaker. Sleek black. Very cushiony. Fits small. Get the next half or full size up to allow room for socks. To box is snug. These are just for the gym or home workouts. You need more expensive sneakers for that. I’m very happy with this purchase as I’ll only use them to work out at home.
New_Balance,5,"Got a pair for 1 of my granddaughter, she loved them so her Mom wanted a pair then her sister, so my guess is they're a pretty good shoe."
New_Balance,5,"Got for a friend that was having problems standing on concrete floors for 8 hours. She was very satisfied and a bonus, thought they were cute."
New_Balance,5,Got for my mom for a Christmas gift and she really likes them. Comfortable and light weight. “Good errand running shoes and for being on your feet all day” she says lol
New_Balance,5,"Got the navy blue and gray as a second pair because these are just so comfortable. The insoles are memory foam, which explains everything. Super light and flexible without sacrifice on support. The picture doesn't show, but the aglets have polka dots on them, which match with the subtle polka Dot upper, and flash of polkadot in the back pull tabs. Even the insoles are polka dot to match! Can't see those when worn but i appreciate little details like that. Can't wait to wear them all the time alongside my first pair!"
New_Balance,5,"Got these as a gift and my mother absolutely loved them. She wanted to start a new walking routine, and these shoes give her the comfort to walk on clouds."
New_Balance,5,"Got these for my daughter for a school trip to Washington DC, where they were going to walk a lot.  She tried on a pair in a store in town but did not like the available color.  As always, came to Amazon for a speedy delivery.  She loves these shoes.  She said they broke in quickly and she's gotten several compliments on them!"
New_Balance,5,"Got these for my wife. She usually wears a 9 in New Balance, Adidas & Hoka. This style definitely runs small. She can feel her toes touch the front, even with no socks.
Only just tried them on, very lightweight, can feel the floor through the sole. Keeping for look & walking around. Hoping they’ll still feel good after a long day!"
New_Balance,5,Got these in two different colors.  The black goes with everything and I usually use it for exercising in.  The minty green color ends up looking pretty adorable as a comfortable walking shoe with everyday attire.  I get a ton of use out of these and after many months they're still holding up nicely.  I often get compliments on them as well. Highly recommend :)
New_Balance,5,Got these on sale and love them for light indoor exercise. Not sure they’d hold up well to running but comfortable for walking and indoor aerobics.
New_Balance,5,"Got this for my lady on Mother’s Day and to buy shoes online and hope it comes and fits was the big thing,
They showed up fit as supposed to and she says they are very comfortable"
New_Balance,5,Great
New_Balance,5,Great
New_Balance,5,Great
New_Balance,5,"Great - slightly wide in the toe box, but I ordered a wide on purpose. Use them for walking the dog and light exercise. I would probably order the medium for more active running, etc."

New_Balance,5,Great everyday shoe! Perfect for slipping on and running errands... not actual running because I don’t do that.  Very comfortable! The laces are a little slick and like to come untied so just double knot them.

New_Balance,5,Great product! Fast shipping good quality
New_Balance,5,"Great product. I wore it to work once it came in. I am on my feet a lot at work. It fits very well although I wish I bought it a size bigger just for more comfort. But once it’s worn in, it’ll probably be more comfortable. I wear a size 5-5.5 in US sizes and it fits extremely well and it comfortable. I would buy again."
New_Balance,5,Great purchase.. I had ordered a leopard print mask & was due for new work shoes I’m glad I found these. They are super cute/lightweight & surprisingly my feet don’t hurt after an 8 hr shift(wearing them for the first time) some might need an insert for arch support but they work for me!
New_Balance,5,Great quality for a low cost shoe. Use 1 more size than your usual.
New_Balance,5,Great quality!! So comfortable
New_Balance,5,Great running  shoes.  Very comfy and fits well.

I highly recommend."
New_Balance,5,Great shoe for lifting. I don't slip when lifting and they are super comfortable. I ended buying a second pair. True to size.
New_Balance,5,Great shoe for nursing. I was so excited to try these shoes. Did a shift in them today and they did great. Not too much arch support so I will be adding insoles. But the shoes held up better than expected!
New_Balance,5,Great shoe for the price. Very cute but runs a little small. I would go up a half a size if you like some wiggle room.
New_Balance,5,"Great shoe if wanting something light weight to wear day to day.  Only complaint I would say is the side does cut down quite low so if your socks showing bothers you, you might want some true no shoe socks or black to blend in which is what I did.  Overall love this shoe."
New_Balance,5,Great shoe!  They are a little hard to get on because of the built in tongue but very comfortable. I usually wear a 7 1/2 but ordered an 8 because I plan to wear a cushioned sock. Fit perfect
New_Balance,5,"Great shoe! Fits great, excellent cushioning for walking all day at work, even with my neuropathy and arthritis."
New_Balance,5,Great shoe! It is a little tight so definitely size up one size! I sized up half a size and I wish I would have sized up a whole size.
New_Balance,5,"Great shoe! Very light and comfortable. Not a shoe that I would wear to workout in, but a very comfortable shoe that can be used as a casual shoe. Looks great with leggins, jeans, and shorts. Still very good support."
New_Balance,5,"Great shoe, airy and light. Very comfortable and stylish as well."
New_Balance,5,"Great shoe, super lightweight, perfect for wide feet. My only comment would be the fabric rubbs the skin on the sides but maybe it is just own issue not a product defect."
New_Balance,5,Great shoe. They run small. Order at least a half size larger than what you usually wear.
New_Balance,5,Great shoe. Wish it had a better arch support. I work retail as you know the floors are never nice to the feet and standing all day. These shoes make it better.
New_Balance,5,Great shoes
New_Balance,5,"Great shoes for working out. I suffer from bunions and this is a pretty comfortable shoe. However, there isn’t arch support so I definitely need to add that support to it. My favorite part is the mini memory foam insole that is attached to the tag 😊"
New_Balance,5,great shoes!
New_Balance,5,Great Shoes!
New_Balance,5,Great shoes!  some of the most comfortable that I have ever worn.  Not sturdy enough for running but perfect for everyday wear as they are light and have alot of cushion.  I actually ordered a pair in another color and ordered a pair for a friend!  She loved them too!
New_Balance,5,Great shoes! I use them for work. I am an ICU CNA and these shoes hold up well. I did put a pair of Dr. Sholls inserts in and that has made these shoe last even longer. I love how light and airy they are. I also pulled the laces off so I didn't have to worry about them becoming untied. I would suggest doing that if you have thin or small feet tho. Over all worth the buy for me ;)
New_Balance,5,Great shoes! Super comfy.
New_Balance,5,Great shoes!! So comfy! I’m a nurse & working 12+ hours means I need a really quality shoe and these are awesome
New_Balance,5,"Great shoes, they stay in shape for the whole school year"

New_Balance,5,Great shoes. I bought them to wear to universal studios and wore them for 12 hours and walked 11.5 miles right out of the box. Comfortable and durable!

New_Balance,5,Great sneakers for workouts!  Very comfortable!
New_Balance,5,Great sneakers prefer them then my other sneakers.

New_Balance,5,Grest wide width shoe
New_Balance,5,Gym shoes
New_Balance,5,Had bout shoes for my clinical at nursing school. They were awful. These are amazing. So light and comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"Had them for about 5 months now -
I work 8 hours, and I’m always on my feet, running (speed walking) through the clinic, and these shoes have been a dream! The first day, they were a bit uncomfortable, I guess they had some breaking in to do, but they’ve been so comfortable the days after. They remind me of wearing Toms in a way. Super light, and make me feel like I’m almost barefoot.

I got a size 6, but I think 6.5 would also work. Luckily the fabric has some leeway.
If you’re in between sizes, go half a size up since they fit sorta slim.
Surprisingly easy to clean even though they’re white."
New_Balance,5,Had these several months now and love them. Can’t beat the quality for the price. Comfortable even through long hikes and the gym.
New_Balance,5,Had to get a half size larger...but very comfortable!
New_Balance,5,Had to return this item as it was a bit smaller than my usual shoe size. Buy a half size up! Overall the shoes have a great look and feel!
New_Balance,5,Had to send back because they ran small. But they are super comfortable and feel like your wearing nothing they are so light.
New_Balance,5,"Had to send back for a size exchange because they run very small. Still could probably go up another size but they fit as far as my toe being right at the end. Comfortable has heck! I use these to work out at the gym and they are amazing. I have flat feet, plantar fasciitis, and had a bunionectomy a year ago. I LOVE these shoes. I want them in all the colors. So comfy!"
New_Balance,5,"Hands down my favorite sneaker! I have several pairs in different colors and can’t get enough of them. I am typically a true 6, but always have to go up half a size in these."
New_Balance,5,Hard to get used to them being snug. Not a hiking shoes due to thinner than normal NB sole. I like them and will wear them for shopping
New_Balance,5,Has great arch support
New_Balance,5,Has issues after starting my fitness journey. These shoes are the best. I can walk 7-8 miles now with no issues.
New_Balance,5,"Hated to buy sneakers online but they are very comfortable, light weight and true to size. Thinking of buying a second pair in a lighter shade."
New_Balance,5,"Have a broken, dislocated toe,no pain wearing these shoes. Maybe will be able to avoid surgery thanks to the comfort of these shoes. White color works well since I am a nurse."
New_Balance,5,Have trouble buying  shoes  but this fits  perfectly
New_Balance,5,Hermosas y quedan perfectas
New_Balance,5,Hi absolutely love these New Balances! I have four pairs of them in various colors and I've never loved shoes like I love these!
New_Balance,5,"Hi all,

I absolutely love New Balance, but always size up from your usual size. I usually wear a Women's 10, but bought my first pair of NB in an 11 after trying them on (Cruz).  This type, I decided to try a 10.5, but returned them for an 11.  So long story short, I always go one full size up for the best fit.  I like wearing ankle socks with mine so it gives you that extra bit for sock layers.  In addition, would recommend an arch support for your heels; this fits in a funny place on my heels, where I can actually feel the inserts because they don't sit right in front of the heel.  Otherwise, super comfortable, slimline so they make my bigfoot feet less bigfoot-y, and love the style of the rose gold on black.  I also ordered black/black and didn't care for the blah feel once it was on my feet."
New_Balance,5,Honestly I LOVE THESE SNEAKERS  👟.
New_Balance,5,"Honestly the best pair of shoes I have purchased in a long time, both online and in store! Definitely recommend!"
New_Balance,5,Husband bought me these to walk with our daughter. They fit and feel great.
New_Balance,5,I absolutely love these shoes I bought two pairs the fit is great they're super comfortable I hope they don't go out of stock anytime soon
New_Balance,5,I absolutely love these shoes! Fits right and is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned! Also very light!
New_Balance,5,I absolutely love these shoes! I am a heavy set girl and I am on my feet all day. I have never had a pair so great. They are light weight easy to clean and don’t hurt my feet by then end of the day! I just love them!
New_Balance,5,I absolutely love these shoes! I work retail and I love how the memory foam fits to my feet. Definitely helps with my day to day workload
New_Balance,5,"I absolutely love these sneakers. I wear them to work almost every shift and they’re still holding up. My only concern is that the foam would wear out fast if I used them to workout or something. I also have to order a half size bigger - when I did that, it fit perfect! They’re cute, simple, and comfy!"
New_Balance,5,I absolutely love these sneakers. I wish they came in brighter colors! The most comfortable pair of sneakers I've ever owned!
New_Balance,5,"I absolutely LOVE this pair of sneakers. When I first tried them on, they felt so lightweight that i was afraid they wouldn't be comfortable to actually walk in. I went to the mall yesterday and walked around a couple hrs (which I haven't done in forever) and my feet did not hurt AT ALL! Def recommend"
New_Balance,5,"I absolutely love this product. Overall, it works very, very nice. I highly recommend it for everyone and anyone."
New_Balance,5,"I absolutely love this shoe! It’s ultra light weight and provides extreme comfort. I’m on my feet for 12-14 hours a day and walk roughly 10-12 miles on concrete flooring.prior to buying these shoes my feet would ache daily, now that’s not a problem. :D"
New_Balance,5,"I actually love these shoes.  Bought them for Disney World because of the reviews and I’m glad I got them.  Feet held up pretty good with all that walking in these shoes.

I did buy a half size up due to the reviews as well and I’m glad I did."
New_Balance,5,I admired these shoes on a client and as soon as I had a chance I ordered them. They are very very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I adore these shoes. Super comfortable. Wouldn’t change a thing.
New_Balance,5,"I already had these in the pink and love them. Wanted a black pair since they are so comfy. I normally wear a 9 and ordered a size 9, they are light weight and fit great! I would buy them.in multiple colors."
New_Balance,5,I am a 61 on the heavy side and stand on my feet all day at work. These thin light weight shoes are amazing.  Support and comfy. I've been wearing them everyday to work for a month and still love love them
New_Balance,5,"I am a big walker. I was very pleased with the support of the issues and the price was great. I did think that they fit as expected, but when I wore socks they were a little tighter. I wear pretty thin socks so I will take that into account when you’re buying them. I did think that the toe with was a little tight, but I have worn them for a week or two and found that they loosened up. I am very happy with the support and overall quality of the issues. I love the dark gray color. I would definitely purchase these again!"
New_Balance,5,"I am a dude and purchased them anyway. I’m a 10.5 so I got a 12. Length is great, a little tight on top. I only notice when I’m driving and not actually on my feet. I really like them. New boot goofin."
New_Balance,5,"I am a huge Nike fan for my running shoes, however these NB shoes have been completely amazing and light weight on my feet - love them"
New_Balance,5,I am a person  who is extremely picky about what shoes I put on my feet. I was looking g for some everyday comfort sneakers that were stylish. These are perfect for everyday and they come in wide. I would not recommend them for working out.
New_Balance,5,I am a personal trainer and group exercise instructor so when it comes to my workout shoes I am very picky. I found these shoes over 2 years ago and have not found another pair that competes. I have bought the same pair of shoes several times over the 2 years as I put a lot of wear on them but they still hold up great. I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a great workout shoe that is supportive yet light.
New_Balance,5,I am a senior walker and always looking for a light sneaker with support.  Amazing gel insole and ever so lightweight.  9 1/2 is my usual size and these fit perfectly.  I'd buy again.  NO wait... I did buy a second pair in a different color... love 'em.
New_Balance,5,"I am a server and I got these to replace the steel toes I got for free that were great for free but hurt!! These shoes are just great though and so airy and not too tight or anything, just perfect!! And very comfortable!"
New_Balance,5,"I am a stay at home mom of three and seem to constantly be running somewhere, so I need comfortable shoes! I have worn them for about 6 months almost daily and they are still as comfortable as the first day I received them."
New_Balance,5,I am a teacher and these sneaks hold up to a full day on the job.
New_Balance,5,I am a teacher and wear them to school.  So I didn’t check the workout box.  It was never my intention.  Love the shoes and super comfy to teach preschool
New_Balance,5,I am a true size 7 and I have a wider foot and these are so comfortable! I will never go back to Nike after using these! I have them in 3 colors and want more!
New_Balance,5,"I am addicted to buying all types of sneakers, especially adidas because they're adorable and comfortable. I've never been a New Balance fan until these. They are so light on your feet and super comfortable. I definitely don't have flat feet, but I wouldn't say I have high arches either and I find the support in these to be moderate. If you're someone who needs a ton of arch support, these aren't going to be all-day shoes for you, but otherwise, I think they're amazing shoes. I love the sleek and slim look they have. I grabbed them in two colors and I plan to buy more in the future. They also wash great in the washing machine."
New_Balance,5,I am almost always an 8 & on the rare occasion an 8.5. In these shoes I had to order a 9. Other than having a hard time figuring out what size I was I love them!
New_Balance,5,I am always hesitate about buying shoes online but these are amazing. Fits true to size and is so incredibly comfortable - absolutely worth it!
New_Balance,5,I am consistently a size 8 and this is a snug eight. Not snug enough to return. Very very comfortable shoe and very good looking
New_Balance,5,"I am glad I listened to the reviews and ordered a 1/2 size up. It is a nice slim fitting shoe. Does not slide. Comfortable to do light cardio in, but much better for cross-training and weight lifting.
Very good looking shoe! Ordered the darker gray once these ones arrived I liked them so much!"
New_Balance,5,I am going to buy another pair of these shoes fearful the may be hard to find. I have washed these is washing machine and they look like nee
New_Balance,5,I am going to order another pair because they are so comfortable. I can walk all day and my feet do not hurt.
New_Balance,5,I am impressed with the quality and comfort of these shoes! I will definitely buy them again!
New_Balance,5,I am in love with these shoes! They are so comfortable and have so much support. I bought these for work since I am on my feet all day. They are light and look awesome!
New_Balance,5,"I am in love with these.  They are perfect to wear while working out, walking and everyday."
New_Balance,5,I am in love with this item will order another pair
New_Balance,5,I am loving these shoes. Super comfortable
New_Balance,5,I am normally 8.5 and had to return them and order a half size up. I have two pairs of these and had to go up a size on both.
New_Balance,5,"I am normally a 7 but since i am in my third trimester I had to order the 7.5 wide and it is perfect! Its affordable, comfortable for walks and looks great!"
New_Balance,5,"I am normally a narrow size 8 but order an 8 1/2 as I normally wear socks. Perfect fit and the texture and laces are such that I can pull it tight around my narrow foot portion. These shoes areSO comfortable, with or without socks."
New_Balance,5,"I am normally at size 9 in most tennis shoes (Brooks, asics, other). An 8.5 if they are unisex or Nike. I ordered a 9 because a 9.5 seemed like it would be large. I got the 9s and they were too small. I returned and ordered the 9.5 and the fit perfectly! I am a physical therapist and on my feet a lot, so these were great and look nice. Would not run in these, but perfect for work, grocery shopping, etc."
New_Balance,5,"I am not a fan of ordering shoes online as they never got & it creates more aggravation then it's worth BUT these sneaks are the BOMB!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE the look, the feel & they are so light weight it's almost like going bare foot which is my fav. Definitely recommend!!"
New_Balance,5,I am on my feet for my entire work shift (8-10 hrs) and these are like soft pillows to my feet!
New_Balance,5,"I am satisfied with the product purchased from Amazon.
The delivery of the item came before the estimated date given as well."
New_Balance,5,I am so glad I ordered these sneakers. They seem to have plenty of support on the inside & feel really comfortable. The section around the heel is not stiff at all & I think that is one reason they are so comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I am so happy with these! Thinking about ordering an extra pair to put up!
New_Balance,5,I am using this shoe as an everyday casual shoe.  Although  it is a mesh fabric it is fine with socks in the colder months.
New_Balance,5,"I am very happy with my purchase!  I wasn't sure about the color at first, they are very bright.  The color is growing on me.  They are very comfortable!"
New_Balance,5,I appreciate the size of the toe box.
New_Balance,5,I approve
New_Balance,5,"I bought a gray pair first as a size 8 which was to small however they fit my daughter perfect so she got those and I ordered a 8.5 in Black. They are so nice, lightweight and like clouds. I normally wear a 8 however some shoes do make me go to and 8.5. So maybe they will not run small for everyone."
New_Balance,5,"I bought a pair a few weeks ago, liked them so much, I bought a second pair, so I can switch off every day. They are very light and fit like a thick snug sock! I'm 70 and walk 2+ miles a day with my dogs. I think it's the heel drop design  that works for me. No intermittent shooting pains in my feet, legs, hips. I wear them all day, not just for walking.  The price was right and, like my granddaughters said...they're cute!"
New_Balance,5,"I bought another pair for inside my house, so comfortable."
New_Balance,5,I bought because of back and foot pain. These are excellent. I can walk with no problem.
New_Balance,5,"I bought new sneakers because my feet were falling asleep when I walked on the road and my legs were sore. This pain went away when I started wearing these shoes. They are very light and perfect for the summer. I don’t sweat much. If you needed a lot of support these would not be for you because they are not tight around your foot, but the foam is squishy and great. I’d get them again."
New_Balance,5,"I bought the all black, and it's perfect for my job which sometimes requires me to dress up, and other times it's okay to be casual. This is the first pair of shoes I've ever purchased that did not hurt me in someway after an entire day of wear. They're light weight and super comfortable. The foam inserts are cloud-like. I will definitely be buying another pair in the future."
New_Balance,5,"I bought the wide, as I have a high arch,  and they fit just right.  True to size.  Comfortable.  Stylish."
New_Balance,5,"I bought them for my daughter who stands at  work all day. All of her various work shoes were uncomfortable or her feet hurt by day’s end. These did the trick. She loves them and I’ll get her another. I wish I’d gotten the black with the animal print on the heel but they’ve been unavailable. So yes, we will buy them again in more colors."
New_Balance,5,"I bought them for work because I'm constantly walking from one place to another. I love them. They are comfortable and so far holding up really well. A lot of times shoes start to deconstruct before my very eyes, but not these."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these about a week ago, and I’ve worn them 5 times to work out in and they work great. I purchased the wide width and they fit snug, but comfortable and as they should. Hoping these last!"
New_Balance,5,"I bought these after researching several brands of shoes to work out in. I decided to get these and I am glad that I did. These have great arch support, and they are tight on the foot to keep your foot from moving around in them while working out. The stretch band over the shoe is perfect for keeping them in place. They fit narrower than most of my wide fit shoes, but these are great quality and after several wears they have yet to stretch out. So far, so good!"
New_Balance,5,"I bought these as a pair of white summer shoes I could wear to the office or around town the fit was perfect for me with plenty of arch support and the perfect width for my feet. New Balance tend to be a trusted brand but I was skeptical buying these online but these did not disappoint. IThey are also easy to clean (wore them to the baseball field where they got pretty dusty) witha wet rag and some warm soapy water. I would highly reccoemnd these shoees and I am purchasing another pair as we speak> if you think NEw Balances are just for old folks think again. These shoes are hip, fit well, and stylish. Highly reccomended."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these as a replacement for my worn-out training shoes. I use them for walking, light running, and the gym. I have wide, flat feet with a bunion on one foot and a pin in the other foot where another bunion used to be, so I am very picky about shoes! These are very comfortable and they accommodate my foot shape. I ordered my normal size, 7 Wide, and they fit perfectly."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these because after research on plantar fasciitis, New Balance shoes seem to come highly recommended. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to work out in them yet due to just having knee surgery, but I wear them for physical therapy. They’re very comfortable and seem to offer nice support thus far."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these because I needed a light weight shoe for a long vacation with 5 miles of walking per day. This shoe exceeded my expectations! They are perfect to lace up once and just slip on and off. I didn't have a chance to break them in before my trip, but that didn't matter as I didn't develop any blisters or rubbing discomfort. I have a high arch and my feet are on the wider side, but these are made of a stretchy material to accommodate that. I am really pleased with how these turned out, and wear them almost every day."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these because of the Minnie mouse theme. Not for true support, I love these easy slip ons for every day use, running errands, etc. I do have a plantar faciitis in both feet, so I use a small heel cup arch support in the shoe and this works great."
New_Balance,5,I bought these first as 8 wide but it was a little too tight. I returned them and went up half size and it was perfect. The shoes are comfy and light weight which is perfect. I run around a Doctor’s office all day. The return was easy and I got the next pair in a couple of days.
New_Balance,5,"I bought these for a trip to Asia and they were super comfortable for the entire week of intense walking!  I've also used them for walking/jogging on the treadmill, and they're super comfy.  Very lightweight and not made of leather.  I would recommend these!"
New_Balance,5,I bought these for my 83 year old mother. She loves them!
New_Balance,5,"I bought these for my daughter to wear to work, and she likes the fit and feel of them. So, overall, I am happy with this purchase."
New_Balance,5,I bought these for my daughter who loved them.  I tried on and now I’m getting a pair. However I wear a 7 but the 7.5 fit very nicely so that’s what I’m gonna get
New_Balance,5,I bought these for my daughter who was experiencing near-debilitating back pain from working on her feet all day in food service. These gave her immediate relief. (Please note that her employer does not require her to have nonskid soles. Tennis/running shoes are acceptable.)
New_Balance,5,I bought these for my HIIT class and they are the perfect shoe. They're supportive and light- it doesn't even feel like I have on tennis shoes.
New_Balance,5,I bought these for my mom because she had these clunky heavy walking shoes that were hurting her feet when we walked. She loves these because they’re very light and don’t weigh her down.
New_Balance,5,I bought these for my mom for when she goes on her daily jogs. She said she loves them and they are very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I bought these for my mother who is a 87 years old and she loves them
New_Balance,5,"I bought these for walking, great comfortable and lightweight shoe."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these for work since I'm on my feet for most of 12 hours and these are awesome for that. I had to send the first pair back because they run small. I normally wear a size 7 but i had to get a 7.5. Other than that, these are great shoes and they look stylish."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these for work, where I am on my feet a lot and very active for fourteen hours, and was able to wear them a whole shift without any issues. Very comfortable and fit very well. Thank you"
New_Balance,5,I bought these for working out at home. I love these shoes. They are light as air and so comfortable. Plus I got them at an unbelievable low price. Cannot rave enough about these!
New_Balance,5,"I bought these for working out. Cute, lightweight and cushy. Fit was with my normal size. I tried sizing up per other reviews and they were too big."
New_Balance,5,I bought these in 2 colors. The magenta and black ones in a 9 and the black in a 9.5. The 9 fit but my toe touched the tip of the shoe when I walked. Im a walker and dont want to ruin my pedi or my toes.  Very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I bought these looking for a good work shoe. I had been through at least a dozen trying to find the right fit and these worked out great!
New_Balance,5,"I bought these on the recommendation of a teacher friend who is on her feet all day.  When I first tried them on, they seemed a little smaller for the size, but since It was past the time limit to return them, I decided to wear them and hope for the best. What a surprise! These are some of the most comfortable shoes I've bought in years. I'm very tough on shoes, and even with the smug fit, they remain my go to shoes for long trips and shopping outings. Highly recommended."
New_Balance,5,I bought these shoes and wore them brand new to Disney for a week. They’ve been excellent! My feet haven’t hurt at all! Can’t wait to use them for workouts at home
New_Balance,5,"I bought these shoes as a gift for my mother and she LOVES them. She already had a blue pair, but requested a gray pair as well. The pillow soft sole makes wearing these shoes comfortable for hours. She has worn them many times now and they still look like new."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these shoes for a trip to Disney. They arrived right before the trip so I had only tried them on, but not walked more than 15 steps in them. I logged over 40 miles throughout the week and my feet felt like heaven. I had no blisters, no aches, no pains - AT ALL. I think it is very rare to find a pair of shoes that you can wear right out of the box and have no ""breaking in"" issues. The price point ($53) was a steal too. I would recommend these x 100!!"
New_Balance,5,"I bought these shoes for long days on my feet. They have a perfect amount of stretch and cushion, and they’re super light! Very comfortable, even after an 8 hour bar tending shift!"
New_Balance,5,I bought these shoes for my 16 year old granddaughter.  She wanted them and couldn’t find them in the retail shops.  She loves them and says they are very comfortable.  I purchased her normal shoe size and they fit perfectly.  They appear to be last years model so if you want them order before they are gone!
New_Balance,5,I bought these shoes for my daughter for Xmas and she loves them.  They are nice looking so she wears them while exercising and with jeans and all.  They breathe and she says they are super comfortable.  Easy to wash and they will last a super long time.  Great purchase.
New_Balance,5,I bought these shoes for our Disney trip coming up in June and cant wait to wear them! They are so comfortable and have memory foam that I love.
New_Balance,5,"I bought these shoes for work - I am on my feet doing video production. Black works well because I like to dress in office attire. But they are so cute, I wear them without socks with my spring pants (or roll up the pants cuff to expose just a little more skin. And they are so comfortable, I use them for walks around the neighborhood."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these shoes for work, they are comfortable, great quality, fit just right, you can barely feel them. I recommended if you walk a lot."
New_Balance,5,I bought these shoes for work. I'm on my feet all day and love the comfort level. I have a different style of new balance that I use for exercise.
New_Balance,5,I bought these shoes right before I went on a trip. We did a lot of walking and these are the most comfortable shoes I have had in a while. We walked 46 blocks a day and rode bikes and my feet were the most comfortable they have ever been. These shoes provide great support and they are true to size.
New_Balance,5,"I bought these shoes specifically to wear when walking my dogs. We do a few walks a day so having shoes that easily slip on and off while providing the support of a sneaker is a must! These shoes are so comfortable and cute. I'm a 8.5 wide in sandals/flats and sized up to a 9.5 based on reviews and they're great — they feel spacious without feeling loose, and I love that even with them tied, there is some elastic built in so you don't have to tie and untie them every time you wear them."
New_Balance,5,I bought these shoes to ride my bike because I needed something light and comfortable. This shoe fits the bill perfectly! I wish they had more colors available in my size.
New_Balance,5,I bought these shoes to use for working out indoors. The toe box is kind of wide so they're not the best when your workouts consists of jumping around a lot. I'm a US 7 and ordered a US 7.5 which is usually the size I get when it comes to sneakers and boots so I have room for socks. Don't know if that played into the fact that they're on the wider side. I still think these are the most comfortable shoes I own. Thinking about buying another pair in a different color!
New_Balance,5,I bought these shoes to wear during work when I’m on my feet for 9 hours. They are so comfortable and supportive. I like that they are slip-ons but still have the shoe laces. I had to go up a half size than I normally wear.
New_Balance,5,"I bought these shoes with the holiday deals and I wish I would’ve gotten another pair at this price! So comfortable and stylish! Fit is a little tighter than hoped, but they will stretch with wearing them."
New_Balance,5,"I bought these to and wore them for the first time to the zoo on my daughter's kindergarten field trip.  They were so comfortable!  I didn't wear socks with them and they didn't smell bad from sweating in them.  I've worn them almost every day since with shorts, leggings, and skinny jeans and they are so cute!  I bought them in the light gray and thought about getting the black as well.  I love the memory foam insole.  I'm a 7.5 and bought the 7.5 and they fit like a glove!"
New_Balance,5,I bought these to wear at work (I work at a Pilates studio).  I’m on my feet most of the day and these have been the perfect shoes to wear while Im at work!  They’re so comfortable and light weight to walk around in and stand.  I’ve gotten so many compliments from members and co workers on the style w/ the cute leopard print on the back 😍.  Love these shoes!  They do run small.  I typically wear a 7.5 but those didn’t fit me and returned them for an 8 which fit me perfectly!  You might have to order a half size up from your normal shoe size!
New_Balance,5,I bought this for comfortable walking shoes you couldn’t use them for any sports or running because there is not a lot of support in the actual shoe but they’re very comfortable I actually bought a pair for my mother because I liked them so much
New_Balance,5,"I bought this shoe a year ago. I've worn it on two tours with great comfort throughout each day. Loved it so much, I bought a back up pair when the originals need replacing."
New_Balance,5,"I brought these sneakers for the gym, what a great purchase! They fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable! Going to order another pair soon!"
New_Balance,5,I buy New balance because I have feet problems and theses shoes are great for that.
New_Balance,5,I can only wear New Balance as I had foot surgery a few years ago.  The support in these are perfect
New_Balance,5,I can wear these with my work clothes and not look like I have on sneakers.  Very comfortable too!
New_Balance,5,"I can’t believe how much these shoes helped me. I work retail and I stand on concrete floors all day every day. I used to wear adidas with a foam insert, but I’d still come home unable to walk around my house because my feet hurt so badly. I saw some good reviews for these and decided to try them. I can’t believe how much better my feet feel. I still have bad days but it’s not near as often as before. I’m able to be on my feet all day, 40 hours a week, without crippling pain. I also noticed that my sciatic nerve in my back has been bothering me a lot less. I can’t recommend this shoe enough for anyone who has pain from working retail. I feel so much better!!!"
New_Balance,5,I can’t express enough how great these are. This is my second pair. Love them! They are definitely the most comfortable and stylish sneakers I’ve ever owned. I hope they don’t discontinue them.
New_Balance,5,"I can’t really give a fair review of these shoes. I really wanted to like them but had to return. I can tell you that if you have flat feet, these are not a good fit. I don’t blame the shoes as I have had problems finding comfortable shoes forever. New balance shoes are my go to, but the arch in these was higher than other styles I’ve bought and just didn’t feel good."
New_Balance,5,"I can’t say enough about these shoes! I love the Nergize line from NB! I bought a pair from Kohl’s, Christmas in 2018 and wear them almost every day! They are so comfortable, and have lasted longer than most shoes I’ve worn over the years. I bought this pair as a backup, because while my shoes are still in good condition I did not want to risk not being able to find them when my shoes finally do wear out. I can’t recommend these shoes enough!!"
New_Balance,5,I cannot believe how comfortable these shoes are. I’m so glad I bought them!
New_Balance,5,I cannot speak for longevity but these feel very comfortable as they have a memory foam insert. I am big on good tread and I was pleasantly surprised. They are very stylish and breathable. Fit is as expected. I usually size up to 7 but am a 6.5. I went with a 6.5 and even with thick socks they feel great and not tight.
New_Balance,5,"I can't believe I ever lived without these shoes!  From the moment I slipped them on, I didn't want to take them off.
These shoes are incredibly comfortable.  Easy to slip on and take off.  I am only an occasional runner, so I hope these will last a long while."
New_Balance,5,I complain about every walking/running shoe I have. I can honestly say this shoe is perfect. Addidas boost and Nike shocks made my ankles hurt to the point I couldn’t walk. These felt like I didn’t have shoe on which was so great. Very light no extra arch and stuff that cause pain
New_Balance,5,"I couldn’t love these shoes more. I hate socks and am a busy mom with three toddlers. These are my go-to shoes to slip on for park walks, errands, etc."
New_Balance,5,"I decided to write a review bc I felt that previous reviews by others were confusing!

First, I love these shoes! They are exactly what I expected- given the size I chose- and they exceed my expectations in arch support and comfort.

I already knew that I wore a Euro 36- so I ordered according to that- which fit perfectly!  However, I will say, that when I say they fit perfectly, my toe is very close to the tip of the shoe, but I prefer my shoes that way.

If you prefer more space, order 1/2 size up.

Arch support was a complaint I read several times when deciding whether or not I was going to purchase. To me, support and comfort are not an issue. They are very comfy, but do not offer the same thickness of comfort that you would find in Adidas or Brooks— those are a different animal— but if you’re looking for a light, weight comfortable shoe for everyday tasks, get these!"
New_Balance,5,"I detest heavy running shoes. These are light as a feather and fit exactly as I expected. Price was right, and they look good. I am very pleased."
New_Balance,5,I did like them straight out of the box. Very comfortable shoes.
New_Balance,5,I did need to size up a 1/2 size. But love this show. Super cofortable. Would  buy another pair in a different color.
New_Balance,5,"I do like them. They're a little wide at the front of the foot, but still comfortable. Very cute. Very light."
New_Balance,5,I do not have narrow heels. I tried my usual size and one size smaller and they both slipped off of my heel even when I tried thicker socks.  These shoes are very light weight and pretty but not comfortable because of the slippage.
New_Balance,5,"I don’t normally write product reviews, but I’m so happy with these shoes I had to share. I have terrible feet and ankles and finding a walking shoe that fits well, supports my feet, is lightweight, and looks good is a nightmare. These shoes are so lightweight I barely know I’m wearing them. They fit like a glove, breathe well, and the memory foam insoles, although not thick keep my feet from hurting and my legs from tiring when I wear them all day. So happy with these so far—hope they hold up!"
New_Balance,5,"I don’t usually write reviews, but I love these! They are definitely more of a walking shoe (I wouldn’t imagine working out in them) but I am on my feet all day and they hold up perfectly! I’m hoping they go on sale again because I want another pair!!"
New_Balance,5,"I don’t wear tennis shoes because they tired my feet, this tennis shoes are perfect super lightweight super comfortable they are perfect for my feet!"
New_Balance,5,I don't get to buy myself anything very often but these were so worth it so comfortable a great workout shoe a great everyday walking shoe
New_Balance,5,"I don't know if anybody else has the same experience with this model of New balance, but I will give them an extra star. Easy to put them on, comfortable, light."
New_Balance,5,"I don't like wearing shoes because they always feel too bulky for me, but I absolutely love these shoes!!!  They fit so well, are so comfortable to wear, and look nice!  I own 4 pairs.  My only complaint is that my smallest toe pushes through the fabric on the sides after wearing them for a few months.  This happened on two pairs, both feet."
New_Balance,5,"I don't typically like sneakers but I have been loving these and choosing them over my comfy flats and boots lately. I got the all-black version so that I could get away with wearing them to my office job and they are pretty inconspicuous. They are stretchy and fit like a glove to your foot which is nice for me as I am prone to ""gripping"" shoes with my toes as I walk. They are super lightweight and the insole is incredibly comfortable. I sometimes get pain in my arches if I don't have enough support and these do give me enough support that I haven't noticed any arch pain. I'm really enjoying these and would love to see New Balance make flats and boots with the same support and structure for walking."
New_Balance,5,"I drooled over these shoes for a few months before I bought them and they are so perfect I don't even know why I waited! The shoes are cute and comfortable, will be perfect for my Disney trip!"
New_Balance,5,I ended up going a half size larger than my normal shoe size and I'm very happy. Soooooo comfy!!
New_Balance,5,"I feel like I got knock off NB. I compared them to my original ones and these new ones are very cheaply made. The sticking is poor, the quality in materials is poor. The “N” in NB is off center. As soon as I put them on I knew something was not right. I’m retiring the item."
New_Balance,5,I find these shoes so comfortable I can not go back to a heavier shoe.  I did have to order a half size larger and wider.
New_Balance,5,"I first found this exact shoe at Nordstrom Rack, but not in my size...I realized that the smaller size was extra smaller, so I figure the sizes run kind of small. Reading couple of reviews, it was confirmed. So, I ordered half-size up from what I usually get in a tennis shoe...so, I got an 8.5 and they fit well. They're cute and light weight. I bought them for an athleisure look than actually doing active active things. I would wear them to Disneyland, but not for a run or a hike."
New_Balance,5,I followed others advice and bought up a half size and am glad I did. They are a great fit. I wear 8 and bought 8.5.
New_Balance,5,"I found my first pair so comfortable, I purchased the same style shoe as a replacement.  Very happy with comfort and fit."
New_Balance,5,"I found the original pair of this shoe at a brick and mortar store and instantly fell in love. I don’t like wearing shoes, but it’s inevitable. I wanted a shoe that was comfortable, breathable, and felt like I wasn’t wearing a shoe (so lightweight). I’ve been a loyal Nike and ASIC shoe buyer for years, but these New Balance shoes are winners. I bought an extra grey pair and black pair on amazon just for when the original pairs need ditched (I have them in 3 colors). Totally worth it, and I’ve since ditched all of my other brand of sneakers."
New_Balance,5,I found them to be super comfortable for working out and work. I use them for nursing so I’m on my feet 12 hours at work. Plus they clean up easily.
New_Balance,5,"I fractured my foot about 8 months ago and I have serious neuromas from wearing heels all the time. These are LITERALLY the only shoes that are comfortable and don’t hurt my foot. I did add small insoles for arch support, but I love these so much that I bought a 2nd color, and will continue to replace my grey ones as they wear out for YEARS to come. Please don’t discontinue these!!"
New_Balance,5,I gave a lot of feet problems and surgeries. These are the most comfy ever and good for my age 25.
New_Balance,5,"I gave them as a gift and my friend was really happy with them, they are real light and perfect for what she needs them"
New_Balance,5,"I gave this shoes to my Mother who has diabetes, and she said it feels amazing on her feet."
New_Balance,5,"I generally have a breaking in period for sneakers, involving blister and bandaids, etc.  These shoes were comfortable right out of the box.  They are also extremely lightweight and have comfortable memory foam insoles.  I'm going to order another pair."
New_Balance,5,I get a compliment almost every time I wear these! They’re comfortable and slip ons. They are snug at first but in a couple days they fit true to size. I’m an 8 and ordered an 8.
New_Balance,5,I get many compliments on this shoe! It fits perfect with great comfort. I wore these for an 8 hour shift and my fit didn’t hurt by the end of the day.
New_Balance,5,"I got a half size up and glad I did! They fit great, and they’re lightweight but great cushioning and support! Love these shoes."
New_Balance,5,I got it for my wife. She loves it.
New_Balance,5,I got the black and white and leopard in a 8W and they are slightly roomy. They are so cute and very comfortable - I wear them with terrycloth shoe inserts and no socks for working and putzing about the house. Love them!!
New_Balance,5,I got the Gray in a size 8.5 and they are so cute and supportive. Will be buying more colors
New_Balance,5,"I got these at a great price for my wife for her to work out in but they're so comfortable and nice she's now using them to dress casually. The only issue is that I should have bought a half size up, but a little stretch will be fine. Highly recommend"
New_Balance,5,I got these for my daughter since she walks almost a mile to school everyday and she really likes them. I'll probably end up buying another pair soon - I hope they come in more colors!
New_Balance,5,"I got these for my daughter that is pregnant and these are great, and especially because they are so cheap and my daughter chose them and she never chooses anything below $100.00."
New_Balance,5,"I got these for my wife and she has enjoyed the first pair so much she requested a second pair (one for house shoes, one for outside shoes). Size runs a little small, so if on the fence between sizes I would recommend to go up a half size. Very comfortable."
New_Balance,5,I got these for my wife because she is pregnant and was having foot and back pain in her other shoes. She loves the fit and comfort of these and we are able to go on walks again. I approve.
New_Balance,5,I got these for work. I work on my feet in healthcare and needed something light and comfortable. These are it! Fit like a glove and feel like I’m walking on a cloud.
New_Balance,5,"I got these shoes for a trip to Disneyworld. They were amazing! No blisters, no pain spots on my feet. I walked 14,000 steps per day for 4 days and these shows were comfortable and held up! Very impressed. I will always wear these shoes for long walks."
New_Balance,5,"I got these shoes for cross training/running and they turned out to be one of my favorite sneakers that I've owned. They fit your feet so well and feel like you're walking on clouds (even when you're running). The only downfall is the laces easily become untied if not tight enough but otherwise, I highly recommend these!"
New_Balance,5,I got these shoes for work. I’m in healthcare so I’m on my feet for extended periods of time and needed something comfortable. These are easy to slip on and have a very soft insole which makes standing/walking bearable. There isn’t any support to the shoe but I have flat feet and don’t find that to be a problem. I would repurchase.
New_Balance,5,"I got these to wear to the gym regularly. I’ve worn them for a little over a month now and they’re really good. My previous sneakers gave me foot pain when I did heavy lifting and these support me great! The shoes stay in place no matter what kind of workout I’m doing, which I needed. Will buy again once they get worn out!"
New_Balance,5,"I guess I'm one of those people who never writes reviews but love these soooo much I had to write one. These could be the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn! They are very light, airy, and cushy. I just started wearing them so I can't speak of durability yet but I plan to wear these as regular every day mom shoes (with a few 30 minute exercise walks here and there.) The only downfall was I had to return for a bigger size. I'm usually a solid 9 but for some reason had to upsize to a 9 1/2 but so glad I did!"
New_Balance,5,"I had a friend on facebook ask people what shoe they like to take on vacation.  The responses for these shoes were numerous so I decided to give them a try.  I LOVE THEM.  I think I'm about ready to buy a second pair. I can wear them with shorts, capris, jeans, workout pants, whatever.  They are easy to slide on (gosh, that makes me sound old, but really it's great not having to tie them each time) and are lightweight.  They are my go-to shoe right now.  I've worn them full days walking at Disney World, running errands or just working around the house.  Excellent for all things."
New_Balance,5,I had a pair of blue one’s for a year and it was time to retire them. I went on Amazon and found the style the Nenegize. I absolutely love these shoes. They work really well I’ve had an ankle replacement and they don’t tube on my ankle bones and have a ton of support yet they are also very comfortable. It feels like walking on a cloud with the memory foam.
New_Balance,5,"I had another pair of New Balance shoes. They were perfect size for my wide feet and very comfortable, but looked too sporty. These shoes are light, very comfortable, fit perfect, and the plain looking matches my wardrobe. I took trip to Germany in these shoes and it was so comfy and no pain felt after walking all day. They have good cushions and no problem to walk on stone paved roads.
One thing I’m not sure is if they are good in the rain. No rain during the trip so I can’t tell."
New_Balance,5,"I had been looking at these shoes for a while, and finally decided to purchase. I am looking to buy a second pair because I love them so much! They look classier than regular tennis shoes but are SO comfortable!"
New_Balance,5,I had been using the same C9 shoes from Target for working out the past two years and finally got these after I saw my friend's. She said they feel like you're not wearing shoes and I'd have to agree! These are perfect for working out or just walking around. I bought two pairs!
New_Balance,5,I had been walking for a few months and started getting sore shins that were becoming painful. I switched to these shoes and they are very comfortable and my shins are doing great!
New_Balance,5,"I had been wearing Brooks running shoes for a few years, but after the last few pairs kept wearing holes over the toe area I needed a change. These shoes are fantastic, especially for the price. They are true to size, and they have just enough stretch to them to keep them comfortable even if you have swelling. The other great thing about these shoes is how light they are. I’m pretty sure they weigh less than some flip flops I own."
New_Balance,5,"I had bumped it size because I thought it was cut small like normal but nope could have kept regular size... I’ll still keep to wear with socks

I’m have a arch, narrow feet.
Soles are removable."
New_Balance,5,"I had foot surgery and needed the extra width.
Not only did they feel good, they are a good looking shoe! Got lots of compliments"
New_Balance,5,I had foot surgery and needed to order a W shoe and the foot box was perfect for the width I needed as my foot healed. Very easy shoe to slip on and very comfortable. I would order again.
New_Balance,5,I had no idea how important it was to have specific shoes for specific workouts... I had been using my running shoes for everything. My outer calves and feet were killing me when I had to do squats and lunges. These shoes are PERFECT! They support my legs and feet so much during squats and weight workouts.... I’m only mad I didn’t buy them sooner!
New_Balance,5,I had one pair of this model previously and I decided to get a second pair in blue because they are very confortable
New_Balance,5,"I had owned a pair of these sneakers before and found these online - same shoe, different color. Perfect fit - quick shipping!"
New_Balance,5,"I had purchased a shoe similar to this one in the past and loved it, so I was hoping this one was the same and it was. I have tendonitis problems in my foot, so it's hard to find a shoe that I can enjoy for more than a few minutes, but these I took to Disneyland and was totally fine even after 8 hours in the Park. Will definitely buy more!"
New_Balance,5,"I had seen these sneakers originally on Nordstrom Rack but unfortunately they were not available in my size so I turned to Amazon who not only had the shoes, in the right size but also at a reduced purchase price. I was thrilled! These arrived promptly and were just as expected, sleek, stylish, comfortable! The memory foam works wonders and allows for longer days on your feet. They're perfect with athletic wear, a pair of jeans, or a sweatshirt dress and fleece lined tights! Really happy with this purchase, especially considering that I'm far more of a boots or flops girl than sneakers!"
New_Balance,5,I had some foot surgery done & the Dr had said to wear a soft comfortable sneaker. So I knew I wanted New Balance  Informally wear a leather stiffer sneaker but he did say soft.  I tried these and these are great. Very comfortable & fashionable. When I returned to the Dr he told me I purchased a great sneaker. Exactly what he wanted.
New_Balance,5,"I had these in a lighter color and slightly different model, but these are nice too. Color is much more green than grey but that's fine."
New_Balance,5,"I had these shoes in grey before my dog chewed them and now I have them in black. Both pairs fit the same, so I know that the quality is consistent. I really like these shoes. They are comfortable and fit well. I will say the laces come untied easily if they are not double knotted. I use them for walking or a light workout."
New_Balance,5,"I had this shoes already in black, but wanted a second pair. I purchase the coral color. It looks great with black scrubs for work. Super comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"I had to buy new insoles for these shoes. I love the style and fit, I just walk too much. I ruined the memory foam insoles in less than 2 months. At my job I walk between 8,000-11,000 steps in a day. Plus, I need that extra arch support. Without it my feet hurt. But other than that, very cute shoes!"
New_Balance,5,"I had to go up a 1/2 size... always a 9 and felt like I needed more room at the end... these are sooo comfy, I run and do CrossFit so the support and padding are great! I never write reviews so that should tell you something! I plan on ordering other colors!"
New_Balance,5,I had to order a half size larger than normal. Other than that I LOVE these shoes. Super comfy!!!
New_Balance,5,"I had to return it for a larger size- one size larger than my norm. (10.5 instead of 9.5). I love the look, and am happy with the not-too-grippy bottom so I can pivot during Zumba."
New_Balance,5,I had to return the first pair because they ran surprisingly small... I ordered half half size up from my regular athletic shoe size and they fit perfectly. I ended buying 2 colors. I love these shoes. They’re really comfortable and cute. I weight lift and do something HIIT style training and these were exactly what I was looking for.
New_Balance,5,I had to return these they ran very wide in the toe box(but narrow in the heel ) and I had to go up to a size 11. I normally wear a 9.5 or a 10. Just not the right fit for me. I opted for a different style of Nee Balance instead.
New_Balance,5,"I had to return. The shoe is not the problem, my picky feet are."
New_Balance,5,"I had to size up but I love the style so much it was worth the hassle of buying and trying them on until I found the right one
 I sized up by 1/2 a size. They are comfy and the style is awesome!"
New_Balance,5,I had to size up from what I normally wear but after I sized up they fit well. Love them!
New_Balance,5,I had to size up half a size for another pair of NB that I have but I love them! Mostly mad at myself that I waited so long to get them!
New_Balance,5,"I happened to come across these shoes and thought for the price, why not try them.
So happy I purchased them. Not only are they very cute, they are very comfortable. I wear a 7 1/2 and that is what I ordered. Though other reviews indicated you should size up. I am not running in these shoes, they are my cute, comfy everyday walking shoes and they are true to size."
New_Balance,5,"I hate buying shoes online because I can’t get the right size the first time. I’m usually a 6(4.5 men’s) and I wasn’t sure how the sizes worked, so I ordered a 5 because the reviews said to order half a size bigger. Those were too small, but thankfully they have an exchange option, so I ordered the 6 wide and they fit awesome! Shipping was super fast and I’m so happy with these (:"
New_Balance,5,"I hate shoes.  They seem to never fit or look right on my feet.  These are slim-looking but loaded with support.  I need a shoe with a rigid sole that has nice arch support.  That's this shoe.  Yet, it doesn't look like I have a big, bulky ortho shoe on my foot.  I love that.  Great product with a lot of style."
New_Balance,5,I hate wearing shoes but there are things you can’t do in flip flops. I absolutely loved these shoes the minute I put them on. They are lightweight and my feet don’t get sweaty. I highly recommend for people like me who just don’t like shoes.
New_Balance,5,"I have ""funky"" feet...a high Arch and works like flat feet (according to foot Dr).  Hammer toe, bunions, etc.  These sneakers are very comfortable and the only ones I will buy, glad I found them."
New_Balance,5,"I have 2 pairs of these shoes now and they are incredible. They are true to size and fit very comfortable. Doesn't take long to break them in, and they're just super cute and stylish. Never buying Nike or other name brands because this does the job. I use them for my 12hour shifts and for workout and I have no issues with them. Good grip and traction, very comfortable and breathable, lightweight, and flattering. Highly recommend!!! And for the price - these are VERY reasonable for the price!"
New_Balance,5,"I have 3 pairs of these shoes & I love them! Soooo lightweight & really comfortable & they look great with almost anything! As said in many reviews-  they run VERY small. If you’re not familiar with New Balance sizing, I highly recommend going to a store & trying a pair on first. Some said to size up 1/2 size but  I had to either go 1/2 size up & wide width, or I had to go up a whole size in regular width  to get the right fit. If you get the sizing right- you won’t regret buying these shoes! Side note- if you’re buying these as a running shoe, I wouldn’t buy them. But, if you need an everyday shoe for light activity, they’re perfect!"
New_Balance,5,I have a bunion and I’m using toe separators so I got a wide in my size. They fit prefect and are comfortable
New_Balance,5,I have a foot problem from a broken bone and shoes are hard to find for me!  These worked so well that I bought more
New_Balance,5,I have a high arch and instep and also the ball of my foot is wide. This makes finding the correct sneaker difficult because the tongue slides to one side or the other of my foot. It affects how I walk on my foot. New Balance has been my go-to sneaker because the wide width fits my foot but I could only find lace-up. FuelCore Nergize V1 Sneaker is the perfect fit for me. The wide width fits perfectly and the tongue is part of the sneaker. No sliding off my instep. The inside sole is memory foam making an extremely comfortable shoe for all-day wear and exercise walks with my dog. I love this sneaker and will be purchasing another pair when the color is restocked.
New_Balance,5,I have a high arch so my feet tend to sit taller where you lace up. But these fit well and are very comfy. I walk about 16k steps a day and I’m excited to be supported by such great shoes.
New_Balance,5,"I have a high arch, and my pinki toes have felt scrunched in my shoes lately. I decided to try an 8W. FEELS AMAZING and comfy. I wear these to workout inside the house. I am going to buy another set for daily wear. Bonus, the wide doesn't make me feel like I have duck feet. :)"
New_Balance,5,"I have a lot of feet problems, these are light weight very comfortable  very flexable I bought 3 pair they fit so good"
New_Balance,5,"I have a narrow foot and it fits me great. Soft on the inside, can totally wear without socks, but I personally prefer socks. I’m a size 10 and it fits true to size. I was concerned that the shape would make my foot look really big, but it doesn’t at all!"
New_Balance,5,"I have a pair of New Balance tennis shoes I love. A pair that my foot doctor told me to purchase because I have arthritis in my feet. I have prescribed inserts in them and need the stability NB provides in their footwear. But they are big and bulky. So sticking with a brand I know and love, I purchased these shoes as driving shoes to take on a long trip because they were slip-on's. The instant I opened them, I was smitten with the style. I loved the fact they were slip-on's but didn't look like slip-on's. I was impressed with the fit, too. The moment I put them on, they were comfortable and cushiony but still had that stability I need in my shoes. I decided to ""break"" them in before my trip, so I went walking in them and to my absolute surprise, they felt BETTER than my older NB shoes with the inserts. Every time I come back from a walk, my feet are tired and achy. And I have to use a massager to get the cramp of arthritis out, but not with these shoes. They fit just right. They feel just right. And they actually helped my feet feel good during my walk. I love them and plan to purchase two more pairs in different colors!"
New_Balance,5,I have a very high arch which requires a wide width to accommodate. These are easy to put on and very comfortable. I'll be buying more.
New_Balance,5,I have a wider foot and these fit me perfectly!  They are extremely comfortable.  The most comfortable tennis shoe I’ve ever worn. They are extremely soft and not binding to the foot in any way. I will buy these again and again.
New_Balance,5,"I have always loved New Balance. Between the fit and how well they are made,  NB is my favorite brand. I have normally used another brand for my work shoes, mainly out of suggestion.  I bought these hoping that they would give me the support and comfort I needed for 9hours on my feet every day.  They are amazing, to say the least.  Light weight, keep my feet cool,  and offer flexibility in all of the right places.  Highly recommended!"
New_Balance,5,"I have another Disney new balance shoe which I love and wear to the parks all the time, but they’re getting pretty worn out so I wanted to get another design. After trying and failing to get these shoes through the new balance website, I was so excited to find them on amazon! The box arrived in perfect shape and the shoes smell and look brand new (something I was worried about), and they fit exactly as my other new balance shoes do so I stuck to my same shoe size and it was perfect. I can’t wait to wear these to the park!! ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ I would give more than 5 stars if I could."
New_Balance,5,"I have another pair of these sneakers in blue that I bought a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, those sneakers were tad bit snug, so this time I decided to go a half size up and they fit perfectly."
New_Balance,5,"I have arthritis in my feet and I LOVE these shoes. When my feet are swollen, they still fit. They are extremely lightweight and have great arch support. I can wear them all day, exercise in them and walk for miles without pain. I've ordered every color available--white, black, blue"
New_Balance,5,I have been having lower back/ hip issues. These have really helped alleviate the pain. They are very comfortable!
New_Balance,5,I have been looking for comfortable shoes that I can just slip on and either go run errands or walk/run. These shoes are super comfy and they hug my ankle just right. I bought a size 8 and I am normally a size 8 so they fit true to size even with socks. I would not recommend thick socks but if you do use thick socks then go up a half size.
New_Balance,5,"I have been walking 3-5 miles daily for the last 35 years.  I recently have developed a neuroma on the bottom of my foot.  The pain was excruciating.  After trying several brands and styles of shoes, this is the one I keep reordering.  Great tread and support for the trails."
New_Balance,5,"I have been wearing New Balance shoes for over 20 years because of its comfort, style and support. These shoes are the most comfortable I have ever put on. I have not yet spent a day with them on. So my view may change. It feels like putting on socks. I purchased the 10.5 because I am a 10 with a wide foot and it was made for me. May buy another pair because they are so comfy."
New_Balance,5,"I have been wearing these shoes for weeks now. This is the first pair of shoes I have had in years that I did not have to put inserts in. They are light and comfortable and provide the support I need. Now I need a pair in a Summer color.
I have only one complaint. The shoelaces will not stay tied. Of course, they are purely ornamental so I just double knot them now"
New_Balance,5,I have bought 5 pairs in different colors and absolutely love them !
New_Balance,5,I have bought and worn several New Balance shoes and am always an 8.5 wide. I did double check the size on this shoe and it is an 8.5 wide but my toe is crammed at the end of the shoe.
New_Balance,5,"I have bought this shoe 5 times now. I have a pretty wide foot and don't have any discomfort wearing these brand new out of the box! Very comfortable, the only bad thing is the cushion in the shoe wears down after a few months. But being an affordable shoe that doesn't bother me much. I love this shoe!"
New_Balance,5,"I have bought this shoe twice both times in two different colors, I love them so much. Plus I love the price, the quality, and that they go with everything!"
New_Balance,5,I have bunions and this shoes fit perfectly and soooo comfortable I can walk all day with no pain
New_Balance,5,I have fibro and plantar fasciitis so I was worried about lasting a week at Disney World. I did some research and found these highly recommended. I wear a women’s size 12 so it’s hard to find shoes that fit and are comfortable. These fit perfectly and are wonderfully comfortable. There isn’t much room for extra inserts in case anyone needs it (I also have a heel lift). But I am crazy impressed.
New_Balance,5,"I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes. They are not athletic shoes, I just wear them as athleisure, but they are SO COMFY!!!!! I love them and will keep buying them when they wear down."
New_Balance,5,"I have had major foot surgery on both my feet. Finding a pair of comfortable shoes isn't an easy task for me. From reading other people's reviews I decided to order a pair as mentioned a half size bigger. These shoes are one of the most comfortable walking shoes I've ever walked in and I walk daily for ninety or so minutes. They are very lightweight, comfortable as my feet don't move to side to side and the memory foam helps the comfort of the shoe. I have narrow feet and the shoe keeps my foot in place with a light athletic sock or one that's a little heavier. I ordered the charcoal color and I'm happy with the color as well."
New_Balance,5,"I have had these before and I finally had worn them out now they’re my gardening shoe. I about never found them. I think the company is discontinuing these shoes so I was thrilled to finally find them in my size.  They are a light gray and go with anything; dress, shorts, jeans, crops etc. you won’t be sorry with this shoe and it will mold to your foot where all you have to do is slip into them. New Balance please don’t discontinue this shoe."
New_Balance,5,I have high arches and these are great!
New_Balance,5,"I have just been diagnosed with planters fasciitis and bunions. Also, my foot is small enough to wear a kids shoe but too wide for comfort. These shoes are PERFECT and SO comfortable for my conditions! I even bought a second pair."
New_Balance,5,"I have little wide feet and a high arch, so shoe shopping is hard. Usually I wear a 7.5 - 8.5 shoe size, I ordered a size 9W to be safe and it fits great."
New_Balance,5,I have metatarsalgia and these are one of the only shoes I can wear without foot pain. I love them
New_Balance,5,I have Muscular Dystrophy and after being pregnant my feet became incredibly wide! These shoes have been awesome! I couldn’t stand wearing sneakers for years til I stumbled on this pair! Happy feet! Worth Every Penny!! But! Buy! Buy!
New_Balance,5,I have narrow feet and these are perfect but they seem like they would adapt to wide feet as well. Walked for days in these in NY and they were comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"I have neuropathy in my foot after surgery. I have not been able to wear an athletic shoe in a few years. This one is comfortable enough for me to wear, so I have 3 pair"
New_Balance,5,"I have never gotten so many compliments on a tennis shoe and they’re so comfortable, however I had to exchange them for half a size larger. I’m usually a 7.5-8 size shoe and have never ever needed an 8.5 but it’s what size I had to get and they fit perfectly so I would size up half a size."
New_Balance,5,"I have never owned a pair of New Balances. I got these just for casual gym shoes for upper body days and cardio. These are so light and airy! For less than $50, I can't believe how much I love them. Seriously one of the most comfy shoes I have ever owned!"
New_Balance,5,I have New Balance athletic shoes in this same size that I wear all the time. I was surprised that these shoes run smaller. I returned and reordered 1/2 size up snd they fit fine.
New_Balance,5,I have only owned these shoes for about a week but I have been wearing them every day to the gym. The memory foam inside the shoe is UH-mazing! These are by far the most comfortable shoe i have ever worn. I don't know about the quality yet because I have not owned them very long.  I will say that they look and feel like quality. I will try and update later but they seem great.
New_Balance,5,"I have plantar fasciitis and have been searching for comfortable sneakers for a while. I've returned 2 pairs prior to purchasing these. Jackpot! These are so awesome. Like walking on a puffy lil cloud! I've been wearing them all day and my feet don't hurt one bit. These are definitely a walking shoe, though, and I wouldn't recommend them for high intensity training or hiking. Otherwise, these are simply wonderful shoes if you want something super cushioning."
New_Balance,5,I have plantar fasciitis and sciatica and these shoes have helped both of those things. They are great for walking long distances and in the gym. Wide toe box is perfect.
New_Balance,5,I have plantar fasciitis. I love!!!! These. Shoes!!! They are amazing!!
New_Balance,5,"I have previously bought Skechers and saw these NB. These shoes are like walking on air! I have a wide foot, ordered the wide and they are perfect..It’s hard to find wide widths...True to size...Great shoes!"
New_Balance,5,I have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. It’s very hard for me to find shoes. So buying shoes online is very risky for me. I ordered the shoes hoping for the best expecting the worst. When I opened up the box the first thing I noticed was how beautiful the shoe was it self. Then when I put my foot in the shoeI couldn’t believe How great my foot felt in it I give these five stars all the way!!
New_Balance,5,I have several colors in these shoes and love all of them.
New_Balance,5,"I have severe neuropathy and these shoes help a lot with walking! Well-cushioned (could use more on the toe part), good arch for support, roomy toe box, and super lightweight. I ordered half a size up and was good."
New_Balance,5,I have short fat feet and it is difficult to go find shoes that fit. These are comfortable even though I could use just a but more space for my big toe.
New_Balance,5,"I have strangely shaped feet.  They're kind of a deep brick shape, high arch and wide in the toe box.  I walk a lot and have a hard time finding shoes that don't rub a blister within minutes.  These are perfect for me.  I did buy a wide width.  Good, not great, arch support.  Best of all, they're light as a feather.  I've walk about 5+ miles a day for the last month.  Still look brand new and I'm very hard on shoes."
New_Balance,5,"I have tall feet, so even wides sometimes hurt my feet by putting pressure on the nerves at the top of my foot.

These are loser, light weight, stretchy, and so not hurt my tall wide feet.

I do wish the top tong of the shoe encompassed the whole foot more but I’m just glad my feet don’t hurt anymore."
New_Balance,5,"I have terrible feet and finding decent fitting, comfortable shoes is hard for me.  I saw the ratings on these and ordered them and they didn't disappoint me.  My normal size was way too small so I suggest ordering a size up.  Sole is well structured and flexible without the huge blocky heel that running shoes have.  Nice fabric upper that doesn't make my feet hot.  I'm going to order another pair when the color I want is available."
New_Balance,5,"I have terrible feet and it’s hard to find comfortable shoes. These shoes are like walking on air. I love them! I bought my usual size despite some reviews, they fit perfect! Best shoes and I love them!"
New_Balance,5,I have the hardest time finding tennis shoes that fit right and don't get uncomfortable after a few hours.  These are THE BEST TENNIS SHOES I have ever owned.  The fit is perfect.  The support is great!  They don't hurt and they help keep my back from hurting.  Will definitely buy again when it's needed.
New_Balance,5,"I have the worst feet. I've returned so many. Amazon must hate me. I largely live is SAS which are sooo expensive and are not the most attractive shoes. I've had reasonable luck with Ryka sneakers and insoles. My most recent pair had worn out when I went wild and tried these out. I don't know how they're so perfect but they ARE. The tops of the sneakers are accommodating to my big toe that pops up a little. I don't know why the arches of the shoes don't hurt my super tender plantar fascia but they don't. They aren't high arches or anything but the shoes just... fit and give really nicely. And they look good! I don't even have my insoles on them. I wish I could find shoes like this that look like dress shoes. I've bought a second pair and am getting a third for Christmas. I've never owned three pairs of the same kind of shoe in my life. I'm an 81/2 W and they're true to size on me. I can understand if you might want to size up a half size but I find them to be a little glove-like. I can wear sock with them and they started a little stiff but, I admit, with having such bad feet and not being able to wear any sort of summer shoes, I have worn these sockless and they look pretty cute."

New_Balance,5,"I have these in various colors. I wanted black so I got the wide version since it was in stock.
I don’t know how these are considered wide. My toes hit the tops, otherwise they fit almost exactly like my regular 7.5. Only big around the ankles.
I’ll leave you with this- these are by far most most comfortable sneaker, however I do use hard inserts for arch support since I’m on my feet all day at work and these, while soft and cushy, offer very littler support."
New_Balance,5,I have these shoes in 4 different colors! My favorite shoes ever! So light and comfy.
New_Balance,5,"I have these shoes is two other colors in a size 10 however I notice my big toe touches so I sized up to a 10.5, now it's just a little too big. But obviously I really like this shoe to have purchased a third pair!"
New_Balance,5,I have these sneakers in a different color and will continue to purchase them in different colors. I have wide feet and a very high arch. They are a little tough to get on when they are new but gets easier with time. They are the most comfortable pair of sneakers I've bought in a long time.
New_Balance,5,"I have this shoe and liked it well enough to order two more pair but these were too small.
Buy at least 1/2 up!"
New_Balance,5,I have this shoe in 4 different collies and they are all amazing! Most comfortable shoe I’ve ever owned!
New_Balance,5,"I have three other pairs of this style, all size 9. For some reason the toe in this pair has a crease like they're too big. The other pairs that I have that don't crease aren't the mesh material. They still are wearable, and just about the most comfortable sneakers I've ever found."
New_Balance,5,"I have tiny arches and was looking for a comfy walking shoe. These shoes are perfect! They are breathable, easy to slip on, and offer the needed support."
New_Balance,5,I have tiny feet for an adult ! I absolutely love how they fit! And this is pair #2 I own the Grey first and now I own the white! I hope these pictures help you to figure out if they are right for you!
New_Balance,5,"I have to give a review later. I had surgery on my left foot, I had bone removed due to an infection. I love the look."
New_Balance,5,I have told everyone about how great these shoes are. I ordered my normal size in the wide width - so I could wear workout socks with them. They fit perfectly!! I took them with me on a one week Disney World trip that included 4 theme parks. First day - I walked over 8 miles in these shoes!! They are definitely made to go the distance in comfort and support. I bought 3 pairs - black - grey - and navy. Everyone asks where I got them. These shoes are one of the best buys I made all year!! I highly !!!!! recommend them.
New_Balance,5,I have very bad heel pain with my high arch and I need support in my shoes. These seem to be great so far and easy to put on and look great. I do use an insole in them as well and the insole fits nicely.
New_Balance,5,"I have very flat feet and arch issues. I always have to put special inserts in my sneakers and even then I have pain. I wasn't expecting much when I purchased these, I figured like with my other shoes I would have to use my inserts with these as well. To my surprise, I did not need any additional support. These sneakers are the most comfortable sneakers I've ever owned and give me the most support I've ever had. It feels like I'm walking on clouds. I normally don't write reviews, but this sneaker is amazing. I am normally a size 8, I purchased an 8 and it fits perfectly. Other reviews have said to size up, but I didn't have that issue. 100% would recommend this sneaker."
New_Balance,5,I have very sensitive feet and find it difficult to find a shoe that is supportive and comfortable. This shoe was comfortable right out of the box. I wore them all day with no rubbing or pinching. I definitely will purchase another pair.
New_Balance,5,"I have VERY wide feet at the toes, starting at the knuckles, and VERY high arches. I have a big bump from Hallux Rigidus on my right big toe knuckle. These sneakers are FANTASTIC!! Easy to get on and off and perfectly wide around the the toe knuckles with a high enough toe box around my knuckles too.  Usually I buy Nike wides in a half size larger than my true size because I could never find what I was looking for in a store and didn’t want to buy something online without trying it on but I took the chance with these and am so glad I did. They are a perfect fit!"
New_Balance,5,"I have very wide feet, and usually shows pinch my toes. The wide is a perfect width for my feet. And they feel like I’m walking on a cloud. May order another pair in the future!"
New_Balance,5,I have wide feet and have to wear special orthotics. These shoes are very comfortable and have flexible toe box that's great for my wide feet. The insoles that come with it are very squishy and comfortable but I replaced it with my own orthotics. So far I haven't gotten any pain or fatigue but I only wear it for walking and work. I don't think they'll be good for running because it doesn't have the kind of support for those active movements. I wish there was something I can wear both for walking and running. Unfortunately my feet won't let me and these shoes are ideal for my needs.
New_Balance,5,"I have wide feet and I’m a true 7, so I ordered 7 wide! They are true to size, however I don’t think it would hurt to go half a size up. They are super lightweight and comfortable! My first pair of NB but definitely won’t be my last!"
New_Balance,5,I have wide feet so I was unsure of how these would look/fit. They are super comfy and do not make my feet look wide at all. The fabric stretches.
New_Balance,5,"I have wide feet with very high arches. I need support and have never found a better athletic shoe than the New Balance brand. I recently had back surgery after losing use of left leg, it's still weak and balance is off. This is the only pair of shoes I own that I feel comfortable walking in and more confident in my balance!"
New_Balance,5,I have worn just about every brand of sneakers. This brand is my favorite. They never disappoint!
New_Balance,5,"I have worn nothing but Nikes for over 30 years.  They were the only athletic shoes that fit.  I have Hallux Rigidus in my right big toe and can't have any pressure on it.  I also broke my ankle last year which caused swelling in my foot that seems to be permanent.  I needed a shoe that did not bind anywhere across the top and was having trouble finding a Nike model that worked for me, so I tried this one.  I also need a very low-soled shoe, like the Free Runs, for my back--not the jacked-up heel you find on most running shoes.  I saw these and decided to give them a try.  They meet all my needs and are extremely comfortable overall.  If you need a lot of structure and support, these are not the right shoe, but if you need a comfortable and flexible shoe, give this a try.

One other thing I love about these is that they are cut very low around the ankle.  I often have problems with shoes that come up too high at the ankles and dig into the bone.  These don't do that."
New_Balance,5,"I have worn these every day since I got them, even returning another pair of shoes I bought as I realized I'd probably never want to wear them now! These shoes feel like putting clouds on your feet, and are so lightweight! I do a lot of walking and carrying groceries and found them so comfy I don't want to take them off when I get home :p (We have a no shoes in the house rule!) They fit true to size but are very low rise so you can't quite get them as snug as you're used to with slightly higher-rise shoes, to be expected obviously. I pull them on like socks and off I go :)"
New_Balance,5,"I heisted for a long time to buy these shoes. I wasn’t too sure about the red strap. I’m so glad I finally got them. The shoe, besides being super cute, is incredibly comfortable and very light weight. I can’t wait to wear them in the parks."
New_Balance,5,"I Help very hard to fit feet. Being a 10 1/2 wide, they are so hard to find. These fit perfectly, I am ordering more!"
New_Balance,5,"I honestly wasn’t expecting to like these as much as I do, but they’re great! I needed a wide pair of shoes to put insoles in and these work great. They’re comfortable and they look nice which is a major bonus!"
New_Balance,5,"I initially ordered 8.5W since a lot of the reviews said to order up. Well I send those back since they were too large. Got my original size, 8. Fit perfectly and comfy."
New_Balance,5,I just bought a second pair of these shoes because I was so pleased with the first pair.  I added a arch support because I have poor arches.  Love the color.  Easy to wash and very light weight.
New_Balance,5,I just bought a second pair. There's so comfortable. If I know I'll be walking all day these are the shoes I go for. I also use these at the gym. I find the gray ones to be a little more comfortable then the Dark Oxide because the fabric used around the toes is a bit stiffer. I think a full size up would have been a better fit in the Dark Oxide. Going up a half size in the gray was a good fit.
New_Balance,5,I just didn’t like that in the inside of the right shoe their a piece a plastic that bothers me. Is not glued correctly so it bothers in the front on my toe.
New_Balance,5,"I just got these sneakers and wore them for the first time today, and let me tell you-they are so comfortable, I'm a nurse and my feet have been hurting so much lately, and I'm hoping these will help. So far, I love them!!"
New_Balance,5,"I just got these so I can only speak on first impressions but I will update if they end up sucking. I love that these come in wide. I will say that I tried these on in store and the regular seemed narrower than normal. I do not usually have to get wide sizes (but maybe I do need wide and have been lying to myself) AND they come in half sizes. I feel like there is never a 10.5. Half sizes always skip 10.5. ALWAYS. These are very comfortable. I would go up in size before I’d go down in these. Happy I purchased. Not sure they are going to last year after year but they are a good around town sneaker

Edit- have had for a couple weeks.
Comfortable but not a running/hiking shoe for sure (never thought they were) but overall great."
New_Balance,5,I just love them!
New_Balance,5,I just love these tennis shoes they are so comfortable. They also do not hurt my bunion on my left foot. You hardly even know they are on your feet the cushion is amazing on the bottom. I had surgery on my right foot in May 2020 and I have been looking for a comfortable shoe that does not hurt my feet. I would highly recommend these New Balance tennis shoes. I’m looking in to buy another pair.
New_Balance,5,I just received yesterday and am wearing them today. I have another pair that are black and I have gotten compliments.
New_Balance,5,"I like everything about the shoe.  I love the color, fit and feel."
New_Balance,5,"I like how it fits, very comfortable"
New_Balance,5,"I like how lightweight these shoes are! I also like the unusual design of a tie-look shoe that actually pulls on without a traditional tongue and lace front. The design has ties that can tighten the shoe, but it is actually a slip on ... no tongue that will slip to the side. I also like the low cut under the ankle bone which is much more comfortable than many of my other sport shoes."
New_Balance,5,I like it
New_Balance,5,"I like NB shoes, but these ran large and I had gotten 1/2 bigger due to other comments. I have way too much toe. For reference I typically am a 7.5 in gym shoes but I should have gotten a 7 in these. Like the insoles but not good for being on your feet all day at work."
New_Balance,5,I like that if feels like you’re walking on pillows.
New_Balance,5,I like that the shoe is very light
New_Balance,5,"I like that the shoes are lightweight. I have diabetic neuropathy, and I can actually wear these without my orthostatic insoles."
New_Balance,5,"I like that these are light weight and a low profile so there isn't any weird rubbing. The color choises are great too. I have wide feet and usually order mens running shoes but it's nice to have a wide option in this for woman They are very comfortable, the only small issue I have is I feel like I can almost feel the floor through the shoe. I don't know how these would be running/walking on gravel but for a comfortable everyday tennis shoe I'm happy with them."
New_Balance,5,"I like that they are light and comfy. They are also roomy. I’m usually a size 7 but I followed the reviews about sizing up, glad I did! I could wear them with or without socks. They are pretty too! Thumbs up!"
New_Balance,5,"I like that they are so light, but they seem shorter than my other New Balance."
New_Balance,5,I like that this shoe is very light and not heavy on my feet.
New_Balance,5,"I like the color, style and price of these shoes but the first time I ordered them they were extremely tight. It looked like my toes were going to bust out of the front of them but they felt comfortable so I sent them back and ordered half a size bigger. The half of size bigger is a little too wide on my foot but length wise fits good but the comfort part wears off about four hours into your first wear. I wouldn’t recommend for someone who is on their feet all day. Still cute for the price. Just won’t wear them as work shoes anymore."
New_Balance,5,I like the ease of putting on these shoes and they are good looking.
New_Balance,5,I like the look of the shoe and they are working out fine.
New_Balance,5,I like the shoes i got the wrong size and kept forgetting to send back to get a different size
New_Balance,5,"I like the shoes themselves. The soles are extremely comfortable... But the laces will not stay tied!! I have to stop multiple times a day to retie them, even with double knots! If you get these shoes, pick up a better pair of laces before wearing."
New_Balance,5,I like the style of the shoe and it's comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"I like the wide toe box.  The shoe feels very cushiony. I get lots of complements on the looks of the shoe.  They can be worn with casual jeans or slacks.  I need to use a shoe horn to comfortably get them on, but that is not problem for me.  Can't think of anything negative.  I would highly recommend these."
New_Balance,5,I like them alot and they are really comfortable
New_Balance,5,I like them and they are comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"I like them, I use them to walk on hospitals floors and so far so good. These are all black which I love, you can match them with anything."
New_Balance,5,I like then they are so light weight don't like heavy shoes and comfortable
New_Balance,5,"I like these shoes for the gym when lifting heavy, I would not recommend for running or high impact they do not have a lot of support or cushion but great for a everyday shoe easy to put on and get out the door"
New_Balance,5,I like these shoes very much. I have a wide foot (I ordered a wide) and I do not feel cramped in these shoes. Great for daily errands and chasing after kids 😁
New_Balance,5,I like these they are comfortable but not as wide as expected at first but after wearing 2 weeks they got a little more comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"I like this shoe because it is light and flexible.  Not too shabby. I could stand for them to be a bit wider but overall the shoe is nice. First day wearing them, also.."
New_Balance,5,"I like this shoe so much I bought 2 white pair and 1 black.  White shoes are hard to keep clean, so I have a ""dressy"" pair and then a work/walking pair.  Love these shoes so much!!!!!.  I'm about to buy more.  I did buy some insoles to go in them.  They don't have a ton of support, but they do have some. I like it. they are very lightweight."
New_Balance,5,I liked everything about the shoes..
New_Balance,5,I liked that they are easy to put on
New_Balance,5,"I liked the product, it's so light and comfy and looks good on my feet."
New_Balance,5,I liked the shoe very much.  It was very comfy with good arch support but it ran small.  I usually wear a 8W in Clarks and I ordered 81\2W but it was still too short.  I reordered it in a 9W.  I have not recieved it yet so don't know if the 9 will work.  But they do run small.
New_Balance,5,I liked this shoe but in my usual 10 it was a little too short.  It hit my big toe.
New_Balance,5,"I listened to the reviews and went up 1/2 a size, I’m typically a Nike fan so I didn’t know if that’s typical of new balance to be a bit smaller but they’re perfect. They’re comfortable and super light I’m glad I bought them."
New_Balance,5,I looked at the reviews. I ordered a size up do they fit perfectly. They are so comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"I love ❤️ this sneakers 👟
The toe box is nice and wide my toes have room, great arch support.
I used them for running but I will be getting my 2nd pair for work. Súper confortable!"
New_Balance,5,"I love everything about these sneakers - comfortable, nice looking, durable. I have problem feet because of bad bone spurs on the base of both big toes - these are one of the few shoes that I can wear for a very long time without pain or discomfort. I put ""too small"" under ""fit"" because I originally ordered my normal size 8Wide and had to send them back because they were way too small. I took a change and ordered a 9.5 W and they fit perfectly. But I need an extraordinarily high toe box, so that may have affected why I needed to go up a whole size and a half. In addition to all of the other positives - there is a large color choice. Great buy for me - I would buy again in a heartbeat."
New_Balance,5,"I love everything about this shoe!  It’s great for the fit, room in the toe area, color (light grey and goes with so much), it’s very lightweight, easy to wear, comfortable and great for packing in a suitcase.  I get so many compliments on this shoe.  I have it also in navy and black.  I just bought the light grey for the second time in case they stop making it.  I want to have another pair ready to wear when the first one is worn out and needs replacement.  If you’re thinking about it, just get it.  You won’t be sorry."
New_Balance,5,"I love everything about this sneaker. Most comfortable! Used for casual walking, indoors and out."
New_Balance,5,"I love how comfortable these shoes are! I'm usually an 8.5 wide, but had to order a 9 wide in this style. Amazon's exchange was hassle free and quick."
New_Balance,5,"I love how comfortable this shoe is!  Love the style as well, and so far I have ordered three pairs in different colors!"
New_Balance,5,I love how cute they are on my feet! They run a little small.. I wear a 7.5 -8 and I needed an 8.5.  I ordered the 8 first and my toe was pushing against the front.  My daughter wears a 7.5 and she said they fit perfect .  So we kept the size 8 for her and ordered an 8.5 for me. Definitely worth buying! They are comfortable.  Pic from Christmas morning.
New_Balance,5,I love how light and comfortable these shoes are. I can walk and stand for long periods of time without my feet and back hurting which is why I felt this was going to be a great purchase. New Balance are known to be very good shoes for posture and confort. Great deal too.
New_Balance,5,I love how lightweight they are. I use them to work in. I'm on a concrete floor all day! So good I bought a second pair!
New_Balance,5,I love how minimal and sleek these are. I ordered a size 5.5 wide (pictures) but they were too snug so I returned and ordered a size 6. I would say they run a little small.
New_Balance,5,I love how they fit and how they support my feet while I’m at work for my eight hours at work
New_Balance,5,"I love how well they fit me, the color and how very comfortable they feel.  Great shoes!!!"
New_Balance,5,"I love it, they’re so comfy already bought two different colors."
New_Balance,5,"I love love love these shoes, they are perfect to work out in and even just wearing everyday. Definitely one of the better shoes I’ve purchased recently."
New_Balance,5,I love love love these sneakers!!!! I wear the all black for nursing school clinicals and my feet last all day. I liked them so much I ordered another color for summer! I wear a 7.5 in Nike and a 7.5 in these. Great fit!
New_Balance,5,I Love Love Love these Sneakers. I work in them and They so Comfortable and Lightweight. The Type of Shoe that Feet will Thank You. Lol!!
New_Balance,5,I Love love my New Balance tennis shoe they are so comfortable and fit wonderfully. I will be getting the grey ones next week Thanks Amazon.
New_Balance,5,"I love my new balance shoes. I have plantar fasciitis so I wax looking for something to help support my condition. As soon as I put these in, they felt super comfortable and light. And they look cute too!"
New_Balance,5,"I love my new shoes. They are so comfortable and I’m able to walk in them
for hours without any issues. I recently came from a 2 weeks trip where I walked in them for 5-10 miles a day and my feet didn’t hurt at all, which is not usual for me."
New_Balance,5,I love new balance and the deal I got on amazon was amazing! They fit great and look just as I hoped. Thanks amazon.
New_Balance,5,I love New Balance. These shoes are really cute and fit well!
New_Balance,5,I love that the are light weight an not bulky like others!  It’s hard to find a size 5.5.  I will probably pick up another pair!
New_Balance,5,I love that there is plenty of space in the toe bed area. Very comfortable so far.
New_Balance,5,"I love that these shoes are lightweight and comfortable. Good for my feet to walk in or do aerobic activity, but I do not recommend them for running."
New_Balance,5,"I love that they are lightweight. Very little support. Maybe a tad small in length so I reordered a half size up from my normal size. They are not too wide for my average foot, but wider than most of my sneakers. All in all I like them."
New_Balance,5,I love the color and the material. I am not a sneaker person but this one I love.
New_Balance,5,"I love the color of these shoes - not a maroon, a little more red. I wore them in London and Paris with leggings and they held up great, still looked brand new, and needed zero break-in time. Looks best with very low cut socks. I added an insert because I hate sore feet. For walking 8 plus miles a day, they were a dream."
New_Balance,5,"I love the comfort and construction of New Balance shoes.  I’m a repeat customer of New Balance shoes, I’m never disappointed."
New_Balance,5,"I love the comfort and fit of these shoes. They are very light, and feel like air. I work 8-9 hours daily, and my feet enjoy the comfort!!"
New_Balance,5,I LOVE the feel of these shoes
New_Balance,5,I love the fit and comfort! I can really get into my Zumba class moving around quickly with the amount of flexibility the shoe provides.
New_Balance,5,I love the fit and ease of the shoes... I guess I didn’t realize that they didn’t have a separate tongue and that it’s more of an all one piece... but still loving them
New_Balance,5,I love the fit and lightness of the shoe.
New_Balance,5,"I love the look and feel of these shoes. I needed something lightweight and comfortable for walking and running errands, not necessarily working out.

 I have narrow feet so I sometimes have difficulty finding athletic shoes that fit properly. I usually wear an 8.5 but ordered a 9 as recommendations said to increase half size up since they run small. These still feel a little tight in the toe box, but am hoping they will stretch out after breaking them in. When wearing thin or no socks they fit perfectly, but with cushioned socks they feel tight. I would recommend sizing up a full size if you prefer cushy socks.

Also, they are extrmely quiet when walking on tile, so if you hate squeaky shoes like I do, this is an extra plus!!!"
New_Balance,5,I love the NB! I’m thinking about ordering another pair.
New_Balance,5,"I love the Nike free rn from 2017, they’ve been my go to shoes for years. These were recommended to me so I decided to try something different. I absolutely love them! They’re just as comfortable as my Nikes and are great for every day wear. I don’t wear them for exercise but rather for an every day comfort shoe. 10/10 recommend. Fit true to size."
New_Balance,5,I love the perfect fit and the light weight of these running shoes!  Absouetly love these shoes therefore I ordered another pair of slip on new balance shoes! So happy I chose this brand!!
New_Balance,5,"I love the shoe, but it does not fit true to size. I’d recommend going up a half size"
New_Balance,5,I love the shoes but it’s not good if the floor is wet too slippery
New_Balance,5,I love the shoes but not for wide width fut. They were really nice looking but I had to return them.
New_Balance,5,"I love the shoes,  very light,  comfortable but there only thing was not true to size , If your a 61/2 get a 7"
New_Balance,5,"I love the shoes.  I usually wear a 7.5 or 8, so I ordered the 8.  I am comfy in them, but feel like they fit like many of 7.5, so you could order up 1/2 size and still be able to wear the shoes very comfortable. Will for sure be ordering other colors."
New_Balance,5,"I love the sneakers, after breaking them in a bit they fit better, still on the small side though especially with socks. So, anyone looking to purchase these should order a half size or size up. I have a size 8, and I could’ve done with an 8.5. Other than that, they’re comfortable and lightweight. I actually wear them to work where I am on my feet for 8+ hours. I never have any pain after wearing them. They seem like they’d be a nice casual shoe too for spring and summer."
New_Balance,5,"I love the support in these shoes, they have been my new daily wear. There is no ""getting used to time"" in the beginning and wear like a dream the entire time. I have worn these for 15 hour days and wasn't tired when I was done. Very happy!"
New_Balance,5,I love the way it fits my wife's foot.Too comfy.
New_Balance,5,I love the way these fit ...super comfortable
New_Balance,5,I love the way they fit
New_Balance,5,I love them but wish they had more support.  Super light and great for the parks. I put my inserts in and worked great.
New_Balance,5,I love them I wish they  had a high bottom  and water cant get inside shoe.i gave it a 5 because there are very  Comfortable  myfeet hurts all the time until I got these shoe I'm  order  more colors
New_Balance,5,I love them they fit perfectly and I use them to run
New_Balance,5,I love them! I’m on my feet 12 hrs and they’re very comfortable!
New_Balance,5,I love them! The color is perfect and they’re so comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"I love them! They are comfortable, supportive and stylish. Getting over 10k steps a day with no blisters or discomfort! They were a bit smaller than expected, but they stretch and I've not had any issues with the snug fit."
New_Balance,5,I LOVE THEM!!! These are the most comfortable shoes ever!!!!
New_Balance,5,"I love them!!!!!  Best shoe I have bought in a very long time, and I buy lots of shoes!!!!  Love the way they look and feel!!"
New_Balance,5,I love them. They’re so cute.  They’re lightweight and easy to slip on.
New_Balance,5,I love them......Very Light sneaker...
New_Balance,5,I love these and they are super comfy and great gym shoes. I have 3 pairs! Just be careful of sizing as each style seems to fit differently. My all gray ones in a 7 are smaller than my navy blue in 7.
New_Balance,5,"I LOVE these athletic shoes! They are incredibly comfortable and light, and I love that the tongue of the shoe is attached so it doesn't shift throughout a workout/run. These are so comfortable that I ordered a second pair - one for home and one for work. These are better than any Nike, Adidas, Under Amour, etc., shoe I've ever had!"
New_Balance,5,"I love these cross trainers. They are great for gym and other aerobic workouts. They provide great support and are very comfortable. The wider toe box helps with stability when doing squats, lunges or horizontal moves. I definitely recommend these, especially for the price!"
New_Balance,5,"I love these cute sneakers! They are so much more than cute, though. They are comfy and cushion your feet nicely. I quickly decided these were my work sneakers and try to keep them super clean. My only issue are the laces...they are flat and tend to come untied many times during the day. I just double tie and then take some time untying when Im home from work. I'm seriously considering buying another pair in black, I really love them!"
New_Balance,5,I love these for waking and running. Glad I purchase them. Deliver as promised too.
New_Balance,5,I love these light weight super comfortable shoes. I bought in another color.
New_Balance,5,"I love these lightweight, comfortable, attractive sneakers. They are my go-to pair. I own several others, but these are so comfortable I wear them frequently. I highly recommend these."
New_Balance,5,"i love these new balance! perfect for running around town and such. i don’t know if i would do intense working out in them- but i’m on my feet all day, they are super comfy. this is my second pair of this style, and  the black with the touch of leopard are so fab."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes - I have 4 different pairs in different colors. They wash well and wear nicely!
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes - super comfy right out of the box. I don't know why other people had issues putting insoles in, it was super easy for me to put in my orthopedic insoles."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes !  I have a bad back and these are the only comfortable shoes I have.... actually, I love them so much, I own 4 other pair of the same shoe in different colors.  The only drawback is it took me 4 weeks to get them.  I'm glad I found them on amazon  !!!  and would definitely order them again !"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes because it really does feel like you are wearing socks. these are the most comfortable shoes that I've had. I don't know much about the arch support. If you need a lot of arch support then maybe these aren't for you. I don't need a lot. These are really comfortable. They are not simply flat shoes. I wear them to walk a lot. I just really like the feeling of not having heavy shoes on my feet. I even bought a pair from my mother who has a lot of pain in her ankles and feet. I got her the wider ones and she loves them!
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes for casual wear- I have 3 pairs. I would never buy them to workout or work/ walk all day on my feet without some kind of insert. They have zero support. They look nice just for a light weight summer sneaker. I love the color combinations and that they are low cut around the ankle.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes for every day wear (more for walking I wouldn't use them for running) I actually bought a second pair because I didn't want to be without them.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes for my everyday workouts at the gym. Light, comfortable & clean- looking."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes for walking , I have nerve damage in my right foot but they are so comfortable and easy on... great shoes cushions my feet and very comfortable!!! THANK YOU"
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes for walking in.  I have two pairs (the black and the gray).  After wearing them a year, I reordered a second in each so I can keep wearing them after the first set wears out.  They are roomy, soft, supportive, and lightweight.  IMO, the perfect shoe. I would not use them for serious running shoes though.  Fantastic to walk all day in though."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes for walking, bicycling & working out. They are comfortable & lightweight."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes invertebrate is crushing my sciatic nerve been buying different kind of and could not find the right one top brands still nothing, up for 7 hours and hurt but not as I used to with the others it helps me to keep my job so that requires a lot of walking."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes so much I bought a second pair. Both pairs are the Magnet/Rose Gold color.  Now I have one for getting dirty and one for the gym. I even wore them to Disneyland and they were awesome. For all of that walking on hard surfaces, I put in a heel cup insert for extra impact absorption because I have a heel spur. On an everyday basis though, I don't use the heel cup. These are especially nice if you have bunions as they are made with flexible fabric and don't put pressure on them. I have even worn them on a hike. They don't have very good traction but they were super comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes so much I ordered a second pair in a light gray.  The shoe runs a little short, so I went up a 1/2 size.
Normally, I wear a size 6.5 but in these shoes I am wearing a size 7 and they fit perfectly. I also ordered the wide size 7 and am glad that I did.  I am thrilled I found these shoes and recommend them."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes so much! I have them in two colors and would totally wear more. I wear between a 7.5 and 8 in shoes and I get 7.5 with these and love them. Just get them, you're gonna love them too!"
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes so much! My feet don't slide in them, they don't hurt my toes, and don't cause me foot-pain like Nikes usually cause me. Definitely sticking with New Balance after these. Also, the color is SO cute.  Received so many compliments.  Also, this review is after normal use AND after a week of over 10,000 steps per day in Disney. These sneakers passed the test with flying colors."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes so much! My sister who is a CNA and me as a part time bartender have not found better work shoes. They are great for long periods of wear and my favorite gym shoes. I enjoy these way more than any of my other big brand name shoes for bar shifts.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes so much, I wear them almost every day! I love that they can slip right on and they are SO comfortable! I agree with most folks that they seem to run a bit small, so it may be best to size up."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes super comfy. I have three different colors in them. Simply a must have for comfort.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes their fantastic and give me a confidence boost when I wear them because they are so cute. I wear a 7.5 to 8 and got size 8 they fit perfectly but if you like a little extra room in the toes I would go with a half size up. The leopard print is super soft the rest of the shoe is very breathable and the shoe laces don't come untied like some people have said. I tied them a week ago and they haven't come undone. I love everything about these shoes.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes they are so comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I LOVE these shoes!
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes!
New_Balance,5,I LOVE these shoes!  But they run a tiny bit short.  Order a half size up and wear socks.... I will return and order half size up because they are so comfortable and look great!
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes!  I bought a pair last summer and ended up getting another pair EXACTLY the same!
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes!  They fit great, give support and are super comfortable.  I have a hard time finding shoes that fit my wide, sensitive feet, but these work great. They look cute with leggings, jeans and capris.  I do wear additional insoles and the shoes still fit great even with insoles in."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes!  They were a little tight getting on at first but after a week or so they are totally fine.  They are very light and comfortable.  I was looking for a light shoe that wasn't clunky to walk around in and these are it!  Highly recommend for walking!!!
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! Accidentally forgot to pack socks for the gym the first day I brought them and I was totally fine! Super super comfortable and flexible. I did a workout on the stair master with them, and then leg day."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! Great fit, light weight and so comfortable. Love the color combo too. Have several pairs of these New Balance shoes."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! I am doing a lot more walking at work and wearing scrubs so these are PERFECT! They are soo comfortable. Only thing is some socks show but I'm okay with that.
New_Balance,5,I LOVE these shoes! I am usually a size 7 in New Balance and I tried both the 7 and 7 1/2. The 7 was snug but the 7 1/2 was just a little too loose. So I stuck with the 7 and now that they are broken in they fit perfect. So go with your usual size. I get so many compliments on these shoes because they are SO CUTE! They are also one of the most comfortable sneakers I own and will be perfect for an upcoming trip where I will be walking a lot. They still feel great and fit great even with my arch supports.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! I bought one pair a few weeks ago and just got another. They’re so comfortable even when I’m on my feet all day. And not having to tie laces every time I put them on is great especially now that I’m pregnant.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! I bought them the black with leopard print and loved them, so I just had to go back and buy the gray pair too. They are seriously so comfortable and so cute!"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! I do Zumba classes a couple times a week and have been looking for a comfortable pair of dance sneakers that don’t slip off the heels and have good grip while still being able to spin and what not. These are the ones! Affordable and cute.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! I don't wear them doing anything intense like running or working out. But I do wear them casually if I am shopping or just hanging out. I get so many compliments on them, many people have asked where I got them. I would definitely purchase these again, when I need another pair."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! I have had issues with plantar faciatis and these shoes provide great support. They are light weight and look sleek, while still providing adequate support."
New_Balance,5,"I LOVE THESE SHOES! I ordered a size up, I usually wear a size 7 and ordered a 7.5. I have received many compliments. I highly recommend these and will purchase more in different colors!"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! I purchased initially for a lifting shoe but bought another pair for everyday use! I did size up a half size and they are perfect!
New_Balance,5,i love these shoes! i recommended to daughter and now she wants one lol
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! I usually wear a 6 or 6.5 and ordered the 6.5 and it fits great.
I am a SAHM and am on my feet chasing a toddler, going outside with a puppy, or standing on hard (concrete slab) flooring to cook and clean. They're very soft on the inside and I love it."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! I was on the fence after reading the reviews but I’m so glad I took the plunge. Definitely order up a half size and they will be perfect! They’re thin and breathable but still have enough support for me to walk all day in them. Definitely recommend !
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! So comfortable and cute. I’m buying them in other colors that are still available in my size. If I could, I would remove half a star for the toe shape bending a little, but I think that’s just a me thing."
New_Balance,5,"I LOVE these shoes! So comfy. The outside is stretchy, so nothing feels ""tight"". Plus they are SUPER cute. I am on my feet 12 hrs a day, plus some sometimes, and these have been the best pair of shoes I have bought for myself in a long time."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! Super comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! These help with my plantar fasciitis and also wide feet. It’s hard finding comfy shoes to work in 12+ hours. My feet and back do not hurt like they did before. I recommend and will be ordering more soon! I wear these daily!
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! They are a great fit! I hate socks and with these shoes I do not have to wear them! Perfect to pair with leggings, shorts or whatever you want!"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! They are comfy and easy to put on and slip off. Definitely worth the money! I want to buy a few more pairs in different colors.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! They are cute, have great traction, perfect for working out but also just hanging around. They are so comfortable and easy to slip on and off without having to undo the laces. Love love love!"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! They are my everyday sneakers and I’m ready to buy more
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! They are so comfortable and easy to slip on and off. They go with any outfit, and this is the second pair I've bought, I love them so much."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! They are so comfortable for my sore pregnant feet, and I walk all day long with my job. Very breathable and light weight as well. Definitely recommend!"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! They are so lightweight that they feel like slippers on your feet. The memory foam insoles are comfortable and supportive. Oh and the look great too!
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! They are super cute and comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! They are super light weight and cushioning. However, I only use them when doing my kettlebell workout and casual walking not for when I do long fast walks. (I walk 5-7 miles a day) I use a more sturdy shoe."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! They aren't thick on the heels and super comfy! The ankles area is low and thin and easy to put on!
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! They slip on easily and are incredibly comfortable. I needed shoes for my day to day at home. By wearing them in my house every day for a week, my back pain almost went away!"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! They’re so light weight and I love the black-on-black look. Very comfortable!
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! They’ve stopped selling them at stores and I don’t understand why. I wear these to work and I’m on my feet all day. They’re really comfortable. I’ve never found a shoe that I love more than these.
New_Balance,5,I LOVE THESE SHOES! They're SO comfortable. I walk 3+ miles every day and at 31 ... SOMETIMES my joints don't like it. These shoes making walking even more enjoyable. I just love that time in my day.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! This is my FIRST Amazon review after buying 1000s of items on Amazon and I felt compelled to write a review.

I have wide feet, so I was really glad to be able to order in wide and they are SOOO comfortable. Super cute and on trend as well. They are really light and breathable, so I wear both with and without socks. I haven't washed them yet, so can't say how they wash. I normally wear an 8.5 in New Balance (and I own a lot of NB), but had to size up to a 9 as these seemed a bit short."

New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! Very light, comfortable and easy to slip on! My favorites by far!"
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes! When I first put them on the toe box felt a little tight, but they've stretched out some since I've been wearing them. They are very comfortable and look great.
When I opened the box I thought they might be flimsy. The material is thin, but they are very durable and I've worn them walking through city streets as well as hiking and they hold up very well."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes! Wore them to work for the first time and my back didn’t hurt and it felt good to walk on them so comfy!!
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes!
When I ordered my first pair a year ago I received the wrong size I got an 8 wide and then returned them for the 8 and a half wide. Everything about them was amazing. I need a wide toe box because I hate having squished toes when I workout. I prefer to have proper feel of the ground. it fit so well right away I was surprised. The heal was the right kind of narrow so it wasn’t sliding around. And the comfort of the foam was amazing but it didn’t feel so thick that I couldn’t feel the ground. It’s a good work and walking shoe.

Fast forward to a year after and the shoes held up well the first thing to go was the interior (but keep in mind I wash my shoes once every 1-2 months.)
So I decided to replace them! I receive my order and it’s the wrong shoe in the right box. So that was annoying but the exchange process was easy. Same style but the heal is way wider then the 8 and a half wide. It feels a little too short length wise, my big toes touches the end even when I stand up. It slid off my foot more then once while I was at work. The part of the shoe that’s wider is more towards the heal and top of the foot rather then the toe box area. It so strange that these fit me different even tho it’s the exact same style and size as my old ones. They fit well enough but not as they have before.

Over all it’s a great shoe! I still wear them all the time it’s just a nice clean sneaker that I wear to work. Easy to slip on and holds shape really well even after a whole year of constant wear, tear and washing."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes!!  I have tile floors and my back started to really bother me from running around the house cleaning and keeping up with my kids, all day.  My Dr. suggested I try wearing shoes in the house.  These are very light weight and comfortable and really help with my back pain."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes!!  They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  Very lightweight, no break in period.  I recommend them to everyone!!"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes!! Can't wait to wear to Disney. They have great support & are nice and light for the heat!
New_Balance,5,I LOVE THESE SHOES!!!  Like walking on a cloud or wearing my slippers!  I already own them in blue.  Just bought the white ones for summer.  Tried them on this morning with my jean shorts and think they’d look great with a dress too!
New_Balance,5,"I LOVE THESE SHOES!!!!! I will absolutely be buying another pair!!  They are great every day, run around shoes, but I can’t say I’d work out in them.  They have stretched out a tiny bit but not enough to be a huge deal.  You can leave them tied a little tight or keep them loose so you can slip them on and off easy."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes,  I’m a nurse and put arch support in as I’m on my feet all day, I have received lots of compliments from other coworkers.  I did get the wide and they were not as wide as I thought they would be.  They are great though! Would recommend!!!"
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes, have ordered several pairs.  They are light weight and super cute.  Worth it"
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes, I actually have two sets in different colors. They fit against my arch nicely giving that cushioning support for everyday walking. Great tennis shoes for the over all price."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes, I love them so much I bought them in two colors!"
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes, I love them so much, I ordered a 2nd pair. They do run a little big, but they work good with socks.  This shoe has no tongue to try to straighten up, the fabric is all one, I love it.  They feel good on my feet too, and the price is right."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes, they are soft material, and light weight.  When I received my new shoes I wore them to work the first night, and loved them.  No breaking in needed.  I love them so much I ordered two more, but different style and color just to have on hand, in case they don't make them after a short time.  I am glad I found them, only shoe's that I can wear without hurting my toes! lol."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes, they fit well and the comfort and color are just perfect"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. Got a pair for my bestie too because she compliments them all the time. They are very lightweight. Great for travel and I think they look great too. I have had them about a year and they get light to moderate use. It’s probably time to replace them but at this price point you could have a pair in every color.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. Highly recommend them, I wear them to work every day!"
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. I am a very hot natured person and wear flip flop more than anything else but when I found these shoes I started wearing them almost every day. I have them in 4 different colors. They are very well vented so your feet do not get hot and they are very stylish and look great with pretty much anything.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. I bought a pair about 2 years ago, and just replaced those with a new pair this week. They held up really well considering how much wear I put into them. Only thing to note, I ordered a size 8.5 and they are just barely fitting. I typically wear an 8, but went up a half size just to be safe. I’m glad I did. They run a bit small."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. I could have ordered a 1/2 size smaller, but with my socks there fine. I didn’t have to put my arch support in them. So time will tell if they hold up."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. I fit a size 5.5 but most shoes start in a size 6. I read they ran a bit small and ordered the 6 and they fit perfectly! They do seem a bit more narrow than most typical tennis shoes but that is what drew me to them. They look thin and fitted and don’t make me look like I am wearing paddles on my feet. Definitely a shoe to wear for errands or short walking sprees. There isn’t any cushion like you would get from a running shoe for added support and comfort. For what I need them for, they are perfect. If looking for a supportive running/walking/exercise shoe I would invest in a different one."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. I have 2 pair of this style because they are so cute & comfortable! They are light weight, breathable and have a nice memory foam insole. Great for walking, workouts or daily wear."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. I have been having a lot of bunion pain but not with these. I only wish I could get my size in all black
New_Balance,5,I LOVE these shoes. I have wide feet and its hard to find womens shoes that fit. I also wear them 8+ hours a day and my feet feel fine
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. I love the slip on factor and for none running work outs they are great.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. I ordered so many shoes just to send them back because nothing fit like i wanted it to but then these shoes came in and it was Christmas morning i was so excited to wear them. I would recommend them every day of the week
New_Balance,5,"I LOVE these shoes. I run and always have bought super expensive, more durable type shoes - I used to run outside. I have arthritis now and run on a treadmill. These are perfect - light weight, great padding, no socks required. Amazing for $35"
New_Balance,5,"I LOVE THESE SHOES. I usually have to break shoes in before they're somewhat comfortable for me. These were comfortable as ever from the first wear. I will probably purchase a second pair to keep on hand, once I wear these out completely. I wear them for work with slacks every day, because the all black is sleek. My favorite pair of shoes thus far."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. I usually wear an 8 or 8.5 so I sized up to 9 and they’re perfect! I don’t do anything too high impact just outdoor walking and indoor cardio and they’re perfect for both. Super light weight and comfy.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. I was not disappointed. I read the reviews before I bought them so I got a half size bigger than regular and they fit good. Can't wait to wear them in Disneyland.
New_Balance,5,"I LOVE these shoes. I wear them a few times a week to work or running errands on the weekend. I run a preschool and spend most of my day on my feet and like to take a 2 mile walk on my lunch break. I needed a pair of sneakers that wouldn’t look too casual or too sporty. I have owned a few pair of New Balance shoes over the years and have loved them all. These look nice with jeans, black jeggings or leggings on the weekend. They aren’t the most supportive and I don’t see them lasting forever, but the price price point and style were perfect. I will be purchasing another pair (in a different color) and when they wear out, I will most likely purchase again."
New_Balance,5,"I LOVE THESE SHOES. I worked in a factory 4 twelve hour days. These shoes are like walking on sunshine! I am no longer in the factory, but these will always be my go to! They are more than affordable for 5je wear they provide!"
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. I’m between a 7.5-8, ordered an 8 and they just fit perfectly. So comfortable and trendy."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. Light, pretty, extremely comfortable. I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse, and these feel great the entire shift. I will continue to buy this shoe."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. Most comfortable sneaker. They are the second pair I have bought and I would purchase them again.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. Super cute and super comfy. I have been wearing them nonstop since they arrived. I was told I would have to wait almost a month for shipping, but the arrived within the 2 day Amazon Prime shipping window."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. They are comfortable and light weight. I have ordered 3 pairs and love them all. The leopard print ones are my favorite, the souls are different. Way softer but still love all 3 pairs. Ill prob keep buying them until I have all the colors I like."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. They are light on my feet and the memory foam cushion is really soft and comfortable. I am 70 yrs old and I do need extra room in the front for sore spots. But I have a narrow heel. The shoes are perfect. Lots of room in the front.  Also supports my arch comfortably. I did order a size bigger though. Price is right too. I will definitely reorder.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. They are light weight and breathable with a thin layer of memory foam in the sole. They fit true to size.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. They are literally my favorite. At first they fit weird in the heel but they soon molded to fit my feet. They are not for long days of standing or long walks / hikes as the have minimum support - but comfy date nights, hanging out -- they are PERFECT. I caught them on sale for $30 too! I am crossing my fingers they go on sale again. I LOVE them. I need another pair. They are extremely lightweight."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. They are so comfy and cute.  I bought them for work to wear with scrubs, but I end up wearing them all the time!"
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable and so cute. I had to buy a size smaller than I normally wear because that is the only size they had left. They are a bit snug but stretchy. I won't run in them because they are too small, but they will be perfect for walking around Disney all day. Also, socks will need to be worn with them because the seem rubs on the top of my foot."
New_Balance,5,I LOVE THESE SHOES. They arrived TWO DAYS after I ordered them! They are exactly what was pictured in the ad. I wore them to work play volleyball in an indoor gym. The grip on the soles is amazing!! They are SO comfortable! The ‘wide’ fit was perfect for my feet! I’m wearing them right now still super happy about my purchase.
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. They fit as expected and the memory foam feels really good on my feet. Great walking shoes and love the style and color I chose as well. Looks true to the images on Amazon.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. They fit, they are very comfy, leightweigth, fast drying when they get wet....a great travel and outdoors activities shoe. It also is elastic and I was able to put on some thicker socks and it still fit me nicely."
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. They look good with anything. Shorts, pants, jeans, capris. They are really comfortable too. I am definitely getting them in every color that is in my size."
New_Balance,5,I love these shoes. They’re great for kicking around the house or for walks. And they look kind of cute too.
New_Balance,5,"I love these shoes. This is my second pair, different color. Love them and will purchase again."
New_Balance,5,"I love these sneakers and Get compliments often. They however have very little arch support so I added some inserts for additional support.
Worth the buy"
New_Balance,5,"I love these sneakers for working out! A little snug in the toe area, but very supportive otherwise!"
New_Balance,5,I LOVE these sneakers! Super cute design and they fit like a glove. Lightweight but supportive and good quality. I will most definitely be buying another pair.
New_Balance,5,"I love these sneakers! They are light weight, comfortable, an priced well. I’m a standard 7, but these sneakers run small, so I went up a half size. I like them mostly because they don’t make my feet look huge.  The seller is great too!"
New_Balance,5,I love these sneakers! They are my go to casual sneaker. I wouldn’t recommend them for working out but I love to wear them on the weekends when running around. They are very light and not bulky in shape.  I get a lot of compliments on these sneakers.
New_Balance,5,"I love these sneakers, I bought another pair in black and would've bought in white if available. I love how they are slip on and also have the laces. They are very light weight but also provide good stability for working out.  I also like them to wear for commuting, very comfortable. The price was also amazing.  I sized up half size from my usual, this is typical for me in sneakers."
New_Balance,5,I love these sneakers.  They are extremely comfortable.  I used them walking all over in Florida.  I would say they are great as a casual walking sneaker.  Probably not enough support for heavy sports.
New_Balance,5,"I love these sneakers. They are comfortable, soft, and fit perfect."
New_Balance,5,"I love these sneakers. They are super comfy and decent support. Not sure I would want to run daily in these shoes, but do love them."
New_Balance,5,I love these sneakers. They’re lightweight and comfy enough for a trip to the store or running errands. Not enough support for me for walking or running but very comfortable and fit perfectly.
New_Balance,5,I love these sneaks. I have wide feet and have purchased bigger sneakers for years to accommodate the width. This is the first pair of sneakers that fit!!
New_Balance,5,I love these sneaks. Super comfy- easy to throw on. I’ve even washed them in the machine.
New_Balance,5,"I love these tennies.. So cute, the animal print is fuzzy, and not cheap looking. I always have to order a half size up with New Balance, so the fit is great. I wear them around the house mostly during the Coved era, bur also wear them to walk the dog numerous times daily. Definitely recommend."
New_Balance,5,I love these! Best most comfortable shoe to wear all day or walk for exercise. I have arthritis in my back and I’m ordering more of these
New_Balance,5,"I love these! great shoes for working out at home - I use them for dance/HIIT classes I had been doing barefoot, and they're perfect.  I think I will buy another pair!"
New_Balance,5,"I love these! I actually purchased a solid black with white pair in a store & came on here looking for a second pair - mostly so I can get matching ones with my son (extra I know, I love it) so found these in the black, grey, white combo in both our sizes. He’s 5 & just went from baby/toddler shoes to “little kid” shoes, so I was excited to find the same style for him. They’re easy on & off, yet fit well & super comfy for every day. You can legit slip them on & off without untying each time, yet they are secure - perfect for a casual shoe & excellent for a kid! My first pair became my go to throw on shoes for day to day taking him to preschool, going for walks, errands etc. they hold up well & are SO versatile, I wear with or without socks, the sillouhete looks great with leggings or shorts even, they’re not chunky or bulky looking."
New_Balance,5,"I love these! I don’t like shoes and tend to wear flip flops (which cause me pain when waking to much) if I need to run out the door for something. These are very light weight and breathe well.  They stretch in the width which is nice because the don't rub on wide or thick ankles.  They do seem to run about 1/2 a size small, in the toe. They are not super supportive for jumping or running or heavy workouts.  They are a nice light weight walking shoe for anyone that normally hates the cumbersome feeling of shoes IMO."
New_Balance,5,I love these! I had found a pair at Marshall's a while back and decided to get a new pair. I would buy a 1/2 down from your regular but all in all I love them! I can wear them all day and not have any discomfort or feel the need for a foot massage like with other shoes. Def my favs!
New_Balance,5,"I love these! I’m a size 8 which I know is an average size for women but sometimes I feel like my feet are boats, especially in sneakers. These fit like a glove and look so slim on my feet. Very lightweight and no need to break them in. I wear no show socks with them and it’s perfect. Very happy with my purchase."
New_Balance,5,I love these! I've never had New Balance but these are light and comfortable. will definitely be buying in other colors!
New_Balance,5,I love these! Light weight and comfy with the arch support I need to feel comfortable with my knee issues. Easy to clean and fit will even with my wider foot.
New_Balance,5,I LOVE these! They have become my favorite to wear. I’ve been eyeballing a second pair. They are so lightweight and comfortable. I NEED and have to have another pair!
New_Balance,5,I love these! Use them everyday!!!!!! I wish i could give it more than 5 stars! YES YES YES ! GET IT
New_Balance,5,"I love these, they are so comfortable & light weight!"
New_Balance,5,I love these. I got them because I'm in nursing school and wanted a comfy pair of shoes. My feet didn't hurt after being in the hospital all day. They run ONE whole size small in my experience. I returned and ordered a size up and they fit perfect. So comfy and CUTE. Definitely recommend!!!
New_Balance,5,"I love these. The fit is excellent, they are super comfortable, and they go great with everything."
New_Balance,5,I love these. They are so comfortable. However hopefully these do run slightly smaller. I’ve seen some comments saying to order the size you would normally wear but I am a size 7.5 in Nike and ASICS shoes. I’ve NEVER had to size up. So... These are a bit snug and next time I will order an 8. I don’t like the feeling of my toes too close to the edge. But I would definitely recommend these shoes. I love the way they look and feel.

New_Balance,5,I love these. They are so soft and comfortable it feels as if you don’t have anything on. I love that the tongue is intigrated and the shoes can be easily slipped on and off. Will buy this brand again. My favorite sneakers. Bought a second pair. Survived 7-8 mile days at Disney for 7 days.
New_Balance,5,I love these. They are super light weight and they fit like a glove for your feet. I love that it almost feels like you are wearing nothing.
New_Balance,5,"I love these. They are very comfortable. This is my second pair. I went up half a size so I think they run a bit small. I have a wide foot but these were fine, I didn't need extra space. I have back issues but can stand up/walk for quite a while without pain or fatigue. They are well made and hold up well, I even washed them in my washing machine and hung them to dry, they still look like new, although the foot pad material curled a bit on the edges. Probably not manufacturer's suggestion but I had a back up pair in case it went wrong."
New_Balance,5,I love these. Very cute very comfortable
New_Balance,5,I love theses sneakers. They are cute but not a walking or running sneaker. They remind me of sketchers. I receive compliments every time I wear the sneakers.
New_Balance,5,I love this item. It came as expected. I am very happy with my purchase.
New_Balance,5,"I love this product, I wear them all day for work, they are so comfortable!! So I ordered another pair!! 💜"
New_Balance,5,I love this shoe —-  so comfortable!!!!!
New_Balance,5,"I LOVE this shoe - i want one in every color!  VERY COMFORTABLE! plus they are super light weight
great for walking!"
New_Balance,5,"I love this shoe and it fits perfectly.  The size and ""width"" were exceeded my expectations.  I would purchase this shoe again in other colors, because it is great to find a shoe online that is sssssooooooo, comfortable."
New_Balance,5,I love this shoe for comfort and support during long days on my feet caring for children. Great walking shoe on irregular terrain or sidewalks/asphalt.
New_Balance,5,"I love this shoe for Zumba and light walking. Not a good shoe for running and if you need a supportive shoe or if you pronate. Price is great, super duper comfortable, and I love these shoes, but definitely depends on what you are using them for."
New_Balance,5,I love this shoe! It’s so comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"I love this shoe, I wear a 5 to 6 size shoe. It's so hard to find a comfortable work out shoe. 5.5 wd fit perfect for me. I will definitely buy again."
New_Balance,5,I love this shoe.  It is great for every day wear and my workouts.  I am a true 8.5 and that is what I ordered.  It fits for everyday wear BUT to workout I will order a 9 for a little extra room.
New_Balance,5,I love this shoe. I have a neuroma on one foot and this shoe doesn’t bother it al all. Will probably buy a second pair. I wear these to work all day in a medical office.
New_Balance,5,"I love this shoe. It’s super light weight & incredibly comfortable. I use it mainly to run errands because it slips on so nicely, look cute & give good support. They were a little snug when I first put them on but after a few wears, have stretched perfectly to fit my foot. Just threw them in the wash (after a little hiking got them dirty) & they came out looking brand new. Highly recommend"
New_Balance,5,"I love this sneaker! It’s lightweight and like walking on a cloud. You’re not going to hike any rough trails with these shoes, but they’re great for daily wear. They’re super comfortable and fit true to size. The appearance is great as well - simple, not overdone and coordinate with many outfit styles. One of the few times a Facebook ad served me something useful!"
New_Balance,5,"I love this sneaker. Fits right, comfortable and looks good with jeans."
New_Balance,5,I love this sneakers it's made walking more enjoyable. I usually have pain on the bottom when walking for long miles but these fit like a glove and i can walk for miles woth no pain. Love them!!!!
New_Balance,5,I love this style of shoe and these didn’t disappoint. I have very flat feet and am on my feet all day long (teacher) so these are a miracle! I will be purchasing more!
New_Balance,5,I love this tennis shoes!!
New_Balance,5,"i love this trainers, i have been suffering from bunions and is so hard for me to find a good pair of shoes, this ones are just perfect for me. i use them to do crossfit and to go to work. they are FANTASTIC"
New_Balance,5,I LOVE those shoes!! The most comfortable shoes i have ever owed.
New_Balance,5,"I love wearing these when we go to Disney World. They look and feel great. I agree with several reviewers that the soles are on the thin side and the arch support is minimal, but my very picky feet haven’t complained at all."
New_Balance,5,I love you have the option to take the shoe strings out.  I bought a black pair from DSW and found the gray cheaper on Amazon.  So now I have both pairs.  Wear them to work as a healthcare professional.
New_Balance,5,"I loved the Color (red) and the fit.  Since the price was within my range, that helped."
New_Balance,5,I loved the color of the shoes and I wasn't sure how they would fit so I went a size up but they are true to size and I wish I'd actually ordered my size now but other than that they fit perfectly.
New_Balance,5,"I loved them. Exactly what I was expecting: they’re discrete, so you can wear it in many occasions; and very comfortable, perfect for long periods standing (like working, in my case) or walking. Can be used to the gym as well."
New_Balance,5,"I loved this shoe!  I am a true 7.5 but it was a little too snug with socks so I sent them back and sized up to an 8.  No biggie!!!  My foot is pretty narrow and skinny but the toe was just a smidge too close for my toes not to rub.  Super light, super comfortable.  Great shoe!!!"
New_Balance,5,I loveeee these shoes!! I’d buy one in every color and print if I could..super comfy and lightweight..I can wear them all day long and my feet don’t hurt like they normally would..my new favorite sneaker!!
New_Balance,5,"I need eide width shoes, which still end up never fitting right. These fot perfectly! I love these shoes! Very comfortable!"
New_Balance,5,"I need to go up in these by 1/2 size as my toes were too close to the end. My size in New Balance varies by a half-size so this wasn't unusual. The footbed was extremely comfortable but I only had the shoes on for a minute while testing the fit so I didn't walk or run in them. I'm ordering the next larger size, though, so that's a pretty good indicator that they're another great NB shoe!"
New_Balance,5,I needed a casual summer shoe that I could slip on and was lightweight. These fit the bill. They feel comfortable and accommodated the orthotic for plantar fasciitis after taking the sole out. I love these shoes.

New_Balance,5,"I needed a new pair of shoes so I went to the Amazon shoe site. It didn't take very long for me to find this pair of shoes. I like the colors and the fit is perfect. They are light weight, which I love. And they are put together very well. I'm happy with my purchase!"
New_Balance,5,I needed a pair of stretchy sneakers to use post op total knee replacement.  These are so incredibly comfortable and stylish as well.  I order the laces that turn them into slip-ons and they look even better!!  Great price for a fantastic shoe!
New_Balance,5,I needed sneakers that look a little like shoes for work. These are perfect. I’m so pleased that they fit on the first try. Super comfortable too. They didn’t even need to be broken in.
New_Balance,5,"I needed some good supporting shoes for my workouts.
I do HIIT exercises so the shoes are an important part of the equation.

These shoes feel super comfy, they look great and they protect my feet."
New_Balance,5,I needed some new everyday sneakers after my puppy ate mine. These are incredibly comfy and the best New Balance I’ve owned. They have nice arch support and my feet never ache at the end of the day. I have worn them to the gym and they work well for elliptical and circuit training. Need them in more colors.
New_Balance,5,I needed the shoe to be large enough to accommodate arch supports so ordered a size up. Worked great. Good value and comfort.
New_Balance,5,"I needed to exchange sizes, usually wear 9, bought 9 and it was too small length and width wise. I do have wide feet and for like admitting it, and most of the time my shoe choice works out. Did not work here...just buy the wide sizes. The exchange was so easy and quick, done within a few days! The shoes are so cute, not bulky despite being wide :) very comfortable memory foam. I love them."
New_Balance,5,I needed to reorder a half size up from regular shoe size. Someone said that was normal for walking shoes.
New_Balance,5,"I needed to size up a full size, but these are soo comfortable. I only had a few days to break them in by walking around the house in them before our Disney trip so I was worried about blisters. But they were sooo comfortable on my feet even after walking 8.5 miles and survived the week great."
New_Balance,5,"I normally don’t give a review... but it’s a must!
I work 12hr shifts standing and waking all day. I love, love these shoes. Very, very comfortable!  I highly recommend them!
They fit true to size."
New_Balance,5,"I normally get a half size larger with New Balance, but forgot when I ordered these. But as o didn’t buy these for exercise I think they will be fine with thin socks.
Nice for running around town, flea marketing, and times when you will be on your feet all day."
New_Balance,5,"I normally take a 7 but got a 7 and half and they are loose fitting but thats what I needed I got wide fit too and I love them.  I have Morton Neuromas and so my feet have been in pain for a while, i wish I could find a dress shoe that was so comfortable.

I got the white ones."
New_Balance,5,"I normally wear a 10 1/2 and ordered an 11. The fit is PERFECT. I haven’t taken them off since they arrived hours ago. They are so light! And cushioned! Like slippers, only better. I am getting another pair!"
New_Balance,5,I normally wear a size 8 but I needed a half size upon this shoe. Love these shoes! They are very lightweight and comfortable!
New_Balance,5,I only wear for walking or leisure. Very lightweight and comfortable!
New_Balance,5,I only wear NB athletic shoes. This pair is much narrower than my other NB shoes. I gave them away.
New_Balance,5,"I ordered 1/2 size up and they fit great. I love these shoes, they are very lightweight"
New_Balance,5,I ordered a 9 Wide after two pregnancies my foot has grown a little wider. The shoe fit perfectly. I walk for 9 hours a day at work about 3.5 miles and my feet felt great while wearing these shoes. I would purchase again!
New_Balance,5,I ordered a half size larger and they fit perfect.  I am on my feet most of the day and they feel great.
New_Balance,5,I ordered a size 7 and I have wide feet. They are super comfortable and I would suggest wearing thinner socks because they fit tighter than I expected. Plus they have super soft and cloud like insoles. They are perfect for taking long walks. So glad I kept them!!!
New_Balance,5,"I ordered a wide but was sent a regular width. I decided to keep it due to limited stock in the color I wanted and it seems to be treating my feet just fine!

Almost everyone in my office wears these for a multitude of reasons. Fun patterns, low profiles, and can be slid on without untying! We love them!"
New_Balance,5,I ordered an 8 1/2 because I was afraid a 9 would be too big. Should have ordered the 9 but I can wear the 8 1/2. Toes are right at the end. They are still very comfortable to wear.
New_Balance,5,"I ordered an 8&1/2 D. The width is perfect if I wear extremely thin socks, but I'm having trouble with the sewn in tongue. It barely leave enough room for the height of my foot. I suppose if it were looser then the shoe would slip around, but I have to wear a very thin sock. My toes have about 1/2 inch left at the end of the shoe and the widest part of the shoe is hitting at the widest part of my foot, so it appears I have the correct size. I am able to wear my plantar fasciitis inserts, but not my plantar fasciitis bands with this shoes. They are NOT like walking on air, although they have a nice feel. They are super light weight and stylish - very cute! I'll keep them because they will be great for work. I'm a teacher. I would not consider these appropriate for aerobics, hiking, or walking for more than 6 hours. You simply do not have the support in your arch or the side of your shoe. They are very cute! Edit: after time these have become my favorite work shoe. I ripped out the foot insert and put in power step inserts. Fabulous!"

New_Balance,5,I ordered half a size larger than I normally would based on reviews and I’m glad I did! I got a size 8 instead of a 7.5 and they fit great! Roomy enough for my sad bunion foot and narrow enough that my arches aren’t sagging. It has a moderate amount of support. I loooove how easy these shoes slip on. They are very lightweight! I’m looking forward to wearing these for workouts and out and about!
New_Balance,5,I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly. Super cute and comfortable to wear while standing on my feet all day. Highly recommend!!
New_Balance,5,"I ordered my normal size on Black Friday at sale price. When they came they were way to small so I had to go ahead and get a size larger, which was a bummer because I didn’t get the sale price. Tho, I complain I love these shoes and would order again! They are super comfy!"
New_Balance,5,I ordered the 5 d (wide) super light weight and soft.  Can wear these all day.
New_Balance,5,I ordered the shoe for work and it's very comfortable and lightweight.
New_Balance,5,I ordered the size that I normally get for shoes and it was great for me! I like my shoes loose. Very light and comfortable. I wish there was a little more cushion in the inserts because I used these at Disney and the long days of walking would have been nice with memory foam type of insoles but even without that they were great for walking around all day in!
New_Balance,5,"I ordered the sneakers to work out in. They arrived on time. I ordered them used, and they look like they’ve never been worn. The sneakers are very comfortable to walk around in and they’re light on my feet!"
New_Balance,5,"I ordered these based on another persons review. After searching every where for a 9 or 10 (I am usually a 9-9.5) I could not find them but Amazon had them in a sz 11. I thought I would give them a chance and man am I glad I did. they fit perfectly. All that to say, length wise these fit very small. So make sure to order up. I am so excited to wear these on our upcoming Disney trip."
New_Balance,5,I ordered these for Disney and I am thrilled that the 10.5 is exactly what I needed. They are comfortable and have a lot of support. I have a slightly wide foot and they feel great.
New_Balance,5,"I ordered these shoes 2 months after foot surgery. I wanted a light-weight walking shoe with sleek style. This pair was exactly what I was looking for. I use these shoes with my custom orthotics, do physical therapy, go walking, use stationary bike, and other non-impact workouts.
I ordered 7.5 (wide), the same as I wear for Asics and Nike sneakers."
New_Balance,5,I ordered these shoes as an everyday walking shoe and I love them. The price is reasonable and they are comfy. You can even wear them with no socks!
New_Balance,5,"I ordered these shoes because we are quarantined to the house due to Covid-19 and I needed walking shoes so I could at the very least walk my newborn around the block. I was very hesitant as some of the photos made the toes look so wide. I thought it looked funny but decided to bite the bullet and at the very least try them. These shoes are AMAZING. I have narrow feet with higher arches, and these shoes while they did fit a little snug the first few times fit perfectly now. They are extremely light weight. I really enjoy that there isn't a tongue on these so I can just skip them on without having to dig the tongue out. They have so much support it makes my feet feel better just wearing them. They are also very airy so that's nice for warm days... Not so much rain weather. As you can literally see outside lol

I have vinyl flooring in my home, and I always wear new shoes in my house first before I take them outside to see if I'm going to like them and these shoes almost made me fall several times as they become slippery when the floor is wet. And the material they are made out of looks like it's going to snag if it touches something like a stick... Or velcrow.

All in all I'm going to be ordering more in different colors because I really like these shoes. :)"
New_Balance,5,"I ordered these shoes for my everyday wear, not exercise and they are perfect for that. Very comfortable and cute!"
New_Balance,5,I ordered these shoes only by doing research by style and comfort level and they are fantastic.  I wear a size 9 normally and my feet are a bit on the wider side and the regular 9 fits perfectly.  Hard to believe how comfortable they are.  I have arch issues and there is just enough support that I don't have to put inserts in them.  The feel lightweight and spongy.  My feet don't seem to sweat in them either.  I love how they look and can hardly recommend them enough!
New_Balance,5,"I ordered this online after reading reviews about the best cross trainers to buy. After breaking them in during an intense workout I can say these are by far one of the best shows I’ve ever owned. They are lightweight, extremely comfortable and spring back when bouncing on them. I highly recommended. Be sure to order a half size up as they run small."
New_Balance,5,"I ordered this show in size 11 and I was pleasantly surprised. Firstly, it fits comfortably and looks good. The second reason why I gave it 5 stars is because it doesn’t make my feet look too big or long like some shoes I have bought in the past."
New_Balance,5,"I ordered true to my size, 7.5. They fit perfectly. I have a narrow foot with a high arch. These are super comfortable and light weight. Im very happy I purchased these."
New_Balance,5,"I originally bought a black pair. They were so comfortable  I had to get another pair. I got the lighter grey. I love them. I will say though, New Balance runs a 1/2 size smaller. I normally wear a size 7 1/2 and had to buy an 8. They fit perfect."
New_Balance,5,"I originally bought these shoes to work in the hospital and they were great for walking but not for standing in one place for a while. I now use them for all of my workouts (except running) and they offer a perfect amount of cushion and support for HIIT, Pilates, leg day, etc.  I will buy again"
New_Balance,5,"I originally looked into buying these shoes because my $200+ pair of sneakers never made my feet feel great, there was always an issue like my arches hurting. I wanted a pair that weren't too expensive but still comfortable. These surpassed my expectations! The soles are cushy like walking on a cloud. I have had no issues and have worked out in them every day for about two weeks now. They are also cute to wear out and about. The other reviews I read did say go up a size, I am usually a 6.5 and went to a 7 and they are perfect! I highly recommend!!"
New_Balance,5,I originally was gifted a pair for Christmas but my lovely dog got ahold of one of the shoes and ate the comfort foam out of it. I love these shoes so much I had to buy another pair. I work in the kitchen and after standing on my feet all day these are perfect for errands. Love how they fit my feet exactly and provide that comfort when I walk!
New_Balance,5,I picked these for the leopard print because I figured I might be able to get away with a little bit of pizzazz. They’re basic but not too basic. The leopard print is cute!
New_Balance,5,I picked up a color that I love at an amazing price.  THANKS!
New_Balance,5,"I plan to own these in every color. Period.  LOVE the color options, love the cushioning, love that they are easy to maneuver around in, and love that they are simply perfect for workouts and short runs."
New_Balance,5,"I probably have the flattest feet on the planet, and my arch area always hurts soooo bad when doing zumba or crossfit style exercise. I did a ton of research and ended up getting a nike pair first with no luck. I tried these next and YALL, they are amazing! No pain when working out at allllll. I read the reviews that suggested to size up, and I would agree. They run about a .5 size bigger than normal."
New_Balance,5,I purchased a pair last year and loved them!  This is my second pair. The toe box is perfect for anyone with foot pain.  A great looking shoe.
New_Balance,5,I purchased these after I had picked my first pair up awhile back.  These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased.  I recently had foot surgery and even though my foot has swelled these stretch and give so well.  Trying to get y foot in a stiff old hard show wouldn’t have worked.  You won’t be disappointed!
New_Balance,5,"I purchased these NB shoes in a similar style to the ones I replaced. I like the light weight of this shoe. They were a bit tight at first but I find they are now a comfortable fit. They provide just the right amount of support needed for short walks. I find them to be stylish too for leisure wear. The downside of these are the laces, they do become untied often if I don’t double knot them, could just me though. I like these shoes and will most likely buy another pair later down the road."
New_Balance,5,"I purchased these shoes after reading reviews and needing a good pair of cute / walking and travel shoes.

They fit great - they look great and extremely comfortable! I'd highly recommend them!"
New_Balance,5,"I purchased these shoes because I love the New Balance brand, and they came in a wide width.  I love to walk/hike, and I feel the most comfortable in a New Balance shoe.  I have issues with a bunion, and also the start of a hammertoe on one foot.  Any kind of rubbing will lead to blisters.  I have to say that this is the most comfortable shoe I have worn in a long time.  I walked about two miles the first day worn.  I highly recommend this shoe!"
New_Balance,5,"I purchased these shoes for my weekend job. They are comfortable in the beginning, but then after 6 hours on my feet, they start to hurt a little. I wish they were a little bit wider in size."
New_Balance,5,"I purchased these shoes to wear in the park (Disneyland).  Not only are they super cute, but they are also so comfortable (like walking on clouds).  I don't have many pairs of shoes that I can walk all day in, but these are one of them.  Five, six miles in the park in one day, no problem!  I have even started wearing them for my daily walks around the neighborhood.  I also LOVE that I can simply slip them on and off.  Tied them once (to get them just right), and I was done.  They are the best and worth every penny of the price!! #rockthedots"
New_Balance,5,I purchased these sneakers for walking. They are perfect for my wide feet and narrow heel.
New_Balance,5,I purchased these to use for going on walks with my son. They are super comfortable and fit pretty good. Great shoes for the price! Wouldn't recommend them for running because they are a tad lose at the ankle but they are perfect for walking.
New_Balance,5,I read other reviews and went up half a size. They got perfect. I love them and will be ordering other colors!
New_Balance,5,I read reviews and sized up a half size and they will be perfect when I wear socks. Love the sleek and slim look of these!
New_Balance,5,"I read reviews prior to ordering and was shocked at how tight these were in the toes (I have narrow feet as well)! I had to order a half size up but am glad I did because they are SO comfortable.

I wanted a pair of stylish shoes that I could slip on for errands and such and let's be honest...NIKEs really aren't that comfortable. Glad I made the switch to these 👍👍"
New_Balance,5,"I read some of the reviews, some mention to sizzle ups half size. I’m so glad I did. I wear an 8 medium and purchased an 8 1/2 in these shoes and they fit great!"
New_Balance,5,I really like my New Balance shoe. Fits well i have lots of comfort.  My arch didn't hurt after a long day.
New_Balance,5,"I really like the overall look and feel of these sneakers. They do seem to be a little narrow, but it’s not a problem for me. I maybe could have done a half size up, but I honestly can’t say if it’s the shoe or if my feet have grown after 2 kids lol! They are pretty comfortable to walk in. Definitely not a running shoe, but that’s not what I bought them for. I do HIIT type workouts and walks around the neighborhood. My one complaint are the laces. The little metal parts on the end make it impossible to keep them tied, sometimes even doing a double knot!"
New_Balance,5,I really like the shoe but it took a few tries to find the right size. They ended up running two sizes too small compared to what I normally wear.
New_Balance,5,I really like the shoes.
New_Balance,5,I really like the shoes.  They are very light and the colour is great.  I will be buying other colours
New_Balance,5,"I really like them - they ae comfortable, yet stylish."
New_Balance,5,I really like them. They love exactly like the picture. They are comfortable. Came a day earlier
New_Balance,5,I really like them. Very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I really like these for walking / casual wear.
New_Balance,5,I really like these New Balance shoes but their sizing is wrong! I wear a 6.5 us in New Balance. After returning these twice I finally ended up with a Size 8. Even now they’re a bit tight. Love them
New_Balance,5,"I really like these shoes, but for personal use, not for work as I had bought them for.  I had bought them after reading reviews that said nurses love them. However I am an X-ray tech and I wear 20lb lead for 8-10 hours straight, mostly standing in one spot and some walking around the room, and these did not have enough cushioning for me.  My feet start out comfortable, but after an hour they were already sore and then painful. I did try these for 5 days and they are just not cutting it for my work. I had bought these to replace a different pair of shoes that had broken and they were so comfortable all day but I can’t find them anymore. I just ordered the beyea new balance shoes to try out.
I am still giving these a 5 star because if I was wearing them doing other things they are fine."
New_Balance,5,I really like these shoes.  I have had neuropathy for 20+ years and these are perhaps the most comfortable shoes I have ever had.  Support is moderate.  I have gotten compliments on them.  Love them!
New_Balance,5,I really like these shoes. Comfy
New_Balance,5,I really like these shoes. So comfortable and fit great. 6.5 wide. I will but again in different color
New_Balance,5,I really like these shoes. They run a tiny bit small but not enough to need a size up. Great purchase.
New_Balance,5,"I really like these shoes. Very comfortable, and they look nice. I couldn't be happier!"
New_Balance,5,"I really like these sneakers! I’m usually a size 7 and was happy to find this size 7 fit me perfectly. I’m on my feet a lot for work and so far, these have been great!"
New_Balance,5,"I really like these! I bought them for my retail job and they have helped alleviate strain on my feet and back. These are pretty comfortable, sort of feel like slippers because they're squishy all around even on the toes. The one negative thing is that these make my feet very hot with or without socks. Overall, these shoes are great and I would buy again."
New_Balance,5,"I really like this shoe, It's a little tighter than I would prefer. I would suggest going up a 1/2 size. But all in all very pleased."
New_Balance,5,"I really like this shoe. Bought my 1st pair in the store and loved them so much I wore them out literally. So I wanted another pair! Found them here on Amazon thankfully. So I ordered 2 pair. These fit my feet well as I have what I call funky feet. Very short space from soles to where my ankle sits so most tennis shoes rub my ankles and are not comfortable. Also have a small narrow foot but is wider in the ball of my toe area and these work on all areas for me! Most shoes rub at the sides of my toes on both sides, but not this shoe. And if I get ones that don't rub then they are to wide normally. So thankful I found this shoe. They are also very lightweight and not heavy to wear all day when i work!"
New_Balance,5,"I really liked them!  The fit is great and I wore them to work and they still felt great at the end of the day.  I would highly recommend them.  And they also have lots of other colors to choose from.  I am certainly going to get some in the other colors.  And to make it funny, I have two cats, a Tuxedo called Felix and a Calico called Maddy.  The other day after I took them off and put on my slippers, I left the shoes by the fireplace.  A little later, I heard some bumps and thumps.  My kitties had one each and were taking the shoes by the laces and throwing and jumping on the shoes.  The kitties also gave the shoes five stars."
New_Balance,5,I really love these shoes! I wanted some lightweight tennis shoes to throw on and these check all the boxes. There is some great cushion in them and they are so comfy! I found the fit to be true to size.
New_Balance,5,"I really love these shoes! They aren’t my favorite pair ever, but they are so cute and very comfortable. I haven’t found socks I can wear with them, which is not my favorite thing but the footie socks might work. I got them at a crazy good deal too!"
New_Balance,5,I really love these shoes. These are gonna get me back in shape so I can fit into my clothes again Thankyou Amazon you did it again! ;$
New_Balance,5,"I really love these sneakers! They’re super light weight but still more supportive than most light shoes, but definitely size up. I usually wear a 5 or even a 3 in kids but got a 6 and they’re perfect. Highly recommend for daily walking shoes."
New_Balance,5,I really love this shoe! I’m on my feet 10 hrs a day and these shoes keep my feet comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"I really love this sneakers, is true to size and comfortable when I walk around in my workplace. I find it hard to keep my other sneakers on for my busy 8 hrs shift, but this one I can wear it the whole day."
New_Balance,5,I really really love the shoes. I work in a warehouse so I need comfort in a lightweight form for those concrete floors and these definitely filled my order.
New_Balance,5,"I recently got orthotics (yay bunions!) and needed to find new shoes that would fit them. These are perfect. Super comfortable, the black is sleek and still ""professional"" enough for me to wear to my business casual office. I removed the inner sole in order for my orthotics to fit, so I can't really speak on the support of the shoe itself."
New_Balance,5,I recommend this!!
New_Balance,5,I red the reviews before buying and bought a half size bigger than normal and I LOVE them so far! Super cute and light weight and comfortable! I have not my tried wearing them for like long walks or when I’m on my feet yet but I love them so far! Will be buying other colors!
New_Balance,5,I saw someone wearing these in Disney World and had to have them. I bought an 8 but would probably order up 1/2 a size next time to an 8.5. Great quality and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments. I love how the Disney/Minnie part is very understated.
New_Balance,5,I seriously love these shoes. They're wonderful. They fit so well too. I'm usually a 7.5/8 and I got a size 8! They're perfect.
New_Balance,5,I should have went an half of size up. I’m finding that not all new balance are cut the same so I cannot get the same size with the different styles
New_Balance,5,I sized up half a size & they fit perfectly! Very comfy.
New_Balance,5,I stand at work most of the day! They are comfortable to wear light weight! I bought two pair because they are comfortable!
New_Balance,5,I stand on my feet all day and they were comfortable from day one.  Very light weight.
New_Balance,5,"I stand on my feet all day
They are great"
New_Balance,5,I started wearing these shoes for walking.  I had pain in the ball of my foot below my big toe and had been told I have arthritis in my foot.  After starting to wear these shoes my foot pain is gone.  I look forward to putting them on each day.  They fit my feet perfectly!
New_Balance,5,I still love these shoes even though they run a bit small. They still feel comfortable and great for walking and standing all day. I would size up when I buy them again!
New_Balance,5,"I struggle finding ALL types of shoes, but especially athletic shoes. These are the best shoes I've ever purchased! SOOOOO comfortable and they are wide enough to fit my feet (I purchased the wide width option). These are great. If you're hesitating to purchase, don't!! You won't regret it!!"
New_Balance,5,"I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis.  These shoes are really comfortable and quite cute.  I am  6.5-7 and order the 7, they fit perfect.
The cushion and comfy feels has helped me to walk with ease."
New_Balance,5,"I suggest treating this shoe as a variation on a summer athletic sandal albeit one with less structure/support. This is a great shoe to wear out walking while shopping but I don’t think it offers enough structure to be useful when out hiking. It is much lighter and less structured than the summer version of the popular, washable wool shoes which began in San Francisco and which I also own.  It’s well made and like most of the New Balances I’ve purchased, allows that not all women have skinny narrow feet. I’m pleased with the shoes & would consider buying more in future."
New_Balance,5,I think this brand fits smaller than others. I'm glad I sized up 1/2 size. Perfect fit. Comfortable
New_Balance,5,"I took the chance,  to don’t go to the store and try the shoes due to the pandemic,  and I was amazed how good they worked to me, I have a Lotta issues with my feet, Because I have varicose vein and it’s so hard for me to find any shoes that made me feel comfortable, I bought 101/2 wide, Normally it’s 10 but I noticed my feet swollen A lot especially in the afternoon so this feels  perfect!"
New_Balance,5,"I tried on a ton of shoes before I found one that didn't seem too tight on my foot and also seemed comfy, and this shoe is it!"
New_Balance,5,I tried them on and they seem to be very comfortable. I am recovering from a fractured foot as I keep using them i am sure that they will be even more comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"I typically walk 10,000+ steps a day for my job and I've had these tennis shoes for a few months now. I love them!! Super comfortable and so light. Not to mention they're cute. I wear them with leggings and with jeans and they don't look awful! My feet are never sore after a long day of walking. My only complaint is that if you're walking in grass after a morning dew, expect your feet to get wet. But that's about it! Definitely will be ordering another pair soon!"
New_Balance,5,I typically wear a regular 8-8.5. They were too narrow and the toe was uncomfortable. I switched to a 9 wide and they have been perfect. Light weight. I bartend and they have helped up to the wear and tear better than my sketchers did. They are not non slip.
New_Balance,5,"I typically wear an 8.5/9. I followed other posts that these ran true to size. When I received them they fit like an 8, so I have processed an exchange for a 9.5 and am hopeful they will fit as I really liked the look."
New_Balance,5,I use my snickers to the gym everyday and I love them . They are super comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"I use orthodox in my shoes for more arch support,there never seems to be enough for me. I love the shoe looks very nice.thank you"
New_Balance,5,"I use them as a workout show for lift at the gym, they are great! Nice and lightweight and look good! I am usually between sizes and went with the smaller"
New_Balance,5,I use these as my everyday walking shoes and love them. This is my 3rd pair! I love how light weight they are!
New_Balance,5,"I use these exclusively for working out, and I love them!  I’ve had them for quite a while now and still feel just as supported as when I got them."
New_Balance,5,I use these on my walks and to wear to school.  So lightweight and comfortable.  I would buy again when these wear out.
New_Balance,5,"I use these sneakers for casual. I love them, and they are comfortable. I do wish I had gone up just a half size though."
New_Balance,5,I use this product for going to work. They are very comfortable and flexible. I will order again definately.
New_Balance,5,"I usually buy Nike because I like the look!  But these are so comfortable.  They don’t provide much support, but very light and comfy"
New_Balance,5,"I usually do not give such an awesome review to things BUT these shoes are freaking amazing!!!! Lightweight, check. Super comfortable, check. Looks cute, check. I was able to workout with them 3 times now and can not believe how much knees don’t hurt after the workout. THUMBS UP!!!!!"
New_Balance,5,I usually size up to 8 in running shoes. Had to return for an 8.5 and I still couldn’t go a mm smaller. So...size up. Love them otherwise.
New_Balance,5,I usually wear 8.5 wide and these tan a little smaller so I ordered 9.5 and they were perfect. Didn’t need to return the other size as they fit my mom perfect and she needed a good pair of walking shoes.
New_Balance,5,"I usually wear a 6.5, but I sized up to a 7 and they are a perfect fit! So lightweight and comfy."
New_Balance,5,"I usually wear a size 5 or 5 1/2 ... so glad I ordered a 5 1/2 ... just fit.  They run a tiny bit smaller, but fit!  And, not sure how they wear yet.  thank you"
New_Balance,5,I usually wear a size 6. I ordered a 6.5. Be cause I was told try run a little small. The 6.5 was just right.
New_Balance,5,I usually wear an 8 and that is what I purchased. They are a little tight but I think an 8.5 would be too big. I wear these for 12 hour shifts. My feet feel great after work and they look great. I hope they last.
New_Balance,5,"I usually wear an 8 in casual walking shoes, but I’m glad I sized up half a size. The toe box would have been too short and snug on an 8. You can’t really tie the laces too tightly, or the tongue will crease or bunch up under the laces. Cute shoes, great price, and I don’t have to tie/untie them every time I wear them."
New_Balance,5,"I usually wear Nike, but couldn’t find my “go to” shoes on sale anymore. So I found these on Amazon and decided to go for it. I ordered a 7 (usually wear a 6.5 in Nike) and they fit Perfectly.

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Seriously. It feels like they were made for my feet. Extremely lightweight. The arch support is amazing for my ridiculously high arches, too!

I will be buying a few more of these ASAP."
New_Balance,5,I walk 3 miles everyday and my feet were KILLING me...these shoes offer good support and are super comfortable. Problem solved!
New_Balance,5,I walk 6 miles a day and these have held up well for several months now. Super comfortable and light weight.
New_Balance,5,I walk all day as a Mail carrier and these really held up the longest out of shoes I have tried. Plus no break in time comfortable since day 1. Will be purchasing again.
New_Balance,5,I walk alot for work. These shoes are light and comfortable. The only issue I have is the shoe lace material comes untied easily.
New_Balance,5,I walked a total of 55 miles at Disney in 5 days.  Like walking on a cloud!  Best shoe ever!
New_Balance,5,I want to exchange these I bought these for my daughters birthday and they are too small I need to order a size 7 wide but it says I can’t return or exchange them ? Is there any way I can work this out ? Thanks
New_Balance,5,"I wanted a cross between a walking shoe and an oxford so I can wear these with casual/dressy pants, not just athletic  gear or jeans. They look nice. They are comfortable. I especially like that the tongue actually extends way down to the sole, something that I realized when I had to jam my feet in them quick like they were slip-ons. It went well because the opening is wider than the usual athletic or lace-up shoe shoe.  I think they're great. Now when I want to be super comfortable and still look somewhat tailored, I can."
New_Balance,5,"I wanted a pair of nice walking sneakers and these fit the bill.  I was surprised that the ties are not traditional ties, they seem more decorative although they do tighten the fit a little bit.  All in all I would recommend these sneakers as non-athletic shoes."
New_Balance,5,I wanted all black but this had white soles. Was too small.
New_Balance,5,"I wanted something lightweight and comfortable for working out. My DIL suggested
these and I am so glad I purchased them. I prefer a wide width but I ordered a half size smaller than I usually buy and they are a little snug but they have a lot of give. They look great on."
New_Balance,5,"I was a little disappointed finding an attached price tag of $39 on these $64 shoes. Other than that they look and fit great, the only thing that hurts when I wear them is my wallet."
New_Balance,5,I was able to add my ortho inserts and they still fit well.
New_Balance,5,"I was actually surprised they fit perfectly. I was worried they would be tight,but they weren't. They are so soft and comfortable. I can wear them walking. Or with jeans or a skirt. I wish other colors were available when I ordered"
New_Balance,5,I was happily surprised by How comfortable these were! I actually ended up wearing them SOCKLESS to Disneyland three full days in a row!
New_Balance,5,"I was hesitant to get these because of comfort and sizing. Once I tried them on, wow! The comfort is spot on especially for me that I'm always busy with my kids. Material is soft foam which makes them an all day long shoe. I recommend them if your looking for price, quality and comfort!"
New_Balance,5,"I was looking for a black pair of shoes to just walk around in. I have a small puppy and we take multiple walks around the neighborhood so I wanted something comfortable without having to drop $100 plus.  These shoes fit my needs perfectly, they're so light and comfortable and the price was right."
New_Balance,5,"I was looking for a comfortable and roomy sneaker to wear for my new job which requires being on my feet for 6 hours. I am very happy with this sneaker. As someone who is easily prone to bunion and plantar fasciitis pain, I highly recommend these shoes. They are extremely lightweight. Very easy to slip on and off after double knotting the laces.  I feel like I am stepping on a cloud every time I put them on."
New_Balance,5,I was looking for a comfortable shoe for work and I actually saw these in a store. I loved them so when I was ready to buy them I did some price shopping. I found this to be the best deal out there and after reading reviews I took everyone's advice and ordered a 1/2 size up from what I normally would order and they fit perfect. These shoes are so comfortable and really cute! I already have other colors in my Amazon wish list to purchase later!
New_Balance,5,I was looking for a good all black shoes for the gym. I don't like bulky looking shoes and this is perfect. It's easy to slip on and its soooo light. This is great for lifting or just walking in general. It's a little short so if you wanna run in em or want to wear thicker socks I suggest going half a size bigger than your actual size. I will be purchasing another one in a different color LOL. This is worth your money. I returned my nikes for these lol.
New_Balance,5,I was looking for a knock around type of shoe that was comfortable and New  Balance is just right for me
New_Balance,5,I was looking for a shoe that was more for a casual day instead of the gym. I have my nice workout shoes I wear for that. I needed something subtle that wasn’t too “tennis shoe-y” if that makes sense so I can wear them out to shop. The heather gray color is what I chose and it was exactly what I was looking for. Padding on the inside was unexpected and nice. I don’t foresee these being shoes that last a lifetime by any means but they’re perfect for right now.
New_Balance,5,"I was looking for a simple shoe that was comfortable and goes with nearly any outfit dressed a little up or down. I also wanted something I could wear without socks in the summer. Purchased in my normal size 7 and, again without socks, I love the fit. Haven't even tried them on with socks, but I think with thin, low crop sock it wouldn't be a problem. Happy with my purchase :)"
New_Balance,5,I was looking for comfortable shoes because I work in my feet all day and these were perfect. I wore them to work for the day and felt great at the end of the day
New_Balance,5,"I was looking for cute walking shoes that didn’t look like old lady shoes. They’re lightweight, slip-on (but have laces to look like they tie), provide support and look great. Love them."
New_Balance,5,"I was looking for some comfortable, everyday sneakers and these are it! They are lightweight and comfortable. Easy to slip on and off. I did size up one whole size, and I’m glad I did."
New_Balance,5,"I was looking for some dark grey on grey shoes, these are perfect for lifting."
New_Balance,5,I was looking for wide sneakers that would not hurt my feet (RA makes my feet swell and can be painful). Very comfortable and super light weight.  I would buy again.
New_Balance,5,"I was looking to replace my favorite New Balance cross trainers as the model I had had been discontinued. These are perfect, very comfortable with no break in period. They feel cool and lightweight."
New_Balance,5,"I was nervous to get these without trying them on but I am so pleased with them!  They are so cute and are very light weight! They hug your foot without squeezing it and are very comfortable!! Definitely recommend!  Depending on the shoe, I wear a 7-8.  I ordered a 7.5 and they are perfect."
New_Balance,5,I was on the market for a new pair of shoes to wear running errands and walking and these are absolutely perfect! The gray color goes with everything. They are so comfortable to walk around in all day. I have received so many compliments on them! Definitely recommend getting a pair or two!
New_Balance,5,"I was skeptical about these sneakers since I don’t seem to have much luck with sneakers. I have a wide foot (after having kids), I’m plus sized(extra strain on my knees) and sneakers just don’t seem to ever fit right. These fit great, like a warm hug on my feet. I work at a hospital and my feet were not sore at all after my shift like they usually are. 10/10"
New_Balance,5,"I was skeptical at first before ordering because I always wore nikes or adidas, but shockingly these are better than both. I have a fairly flat foot with a tendency for my feet to turn inwards when I walk. These shoes have enough support so my feet stay in place and don’t curve inwards when I walk. They are also extremely comfortable. I didn’t have to break them in or anything, the first day I got them I went to the gym and had no problem working out. They are also very light weight. Overall I had them for a week, wore them everyday and have no complaints."
New_Balance,5,"I was skeptical buying them for a cheap 34 bucks, wear them basically every day in love... Thrown the in the washer a couple times, they do get water, wet easy living in Florida is the only down side for me, but they dry super quick breathing easy no sweaty feet I always wear socks, flexible, good grip, light weight, I bought them in July and today 11-1-20 I was looking for another pair but no stock im sad... great buy. I walk over 15000 steps a day no soar feet, support is great flat footed problems no issue"
New_Balance,5,"I was skeptical to spend 73.00 in a pair of sneakers because I always buy mine in Marshalls. However,  at 56 I'm retaking gym life and bought them. Best sneakers ever!!!!! They're so light and cushiony!!! Highly Recommended!!!!"
New_Balance,5,"I was so excited to get these. I wear them to the gym and around the town. They are so comfortable and they stretch tell. They aren't tradition tennis shoes with a tongue. Instead, they slide on like a sock. It took me a while to get them dirty, but they washed off easily in the washing machine and look new. I highly recommend these highly comfortable shoes!"
New_Balance,5,I was so skeptical of these... I wore them with socks during an all day downpour at Disney World... Leaked as expected... But .. they were still comfortable... I didn't like the look with socks.. they are definitely for no shows.. but with the weird awesome looking sides... I prefer them without socks. I just love them.
New_Balance,5,I was unsure about getting these from some of the reviews but I’m a fan. Seem like they are good quality. They are lightweight. They look really modern and cute. I thought they were like hunter green though and they are gray but I still like them
New_Balance,5,I was very pleased with this shoe.  It is like wearing slippers.
New_Balance,5,"I was worried about the sizing... first time buying New Balance shoes, but they fit just perfect! I'm size 10 and ordered that size 🤟🏻"
New_Balance,5,I wear a 7W and bought a 7W.  These shoes fit perfectly!  I purchased them for a trip to Europe where I am walking a minimum of 5 miles per day.  I am on Week 2 of my trip and have no blisters and no sore feet at the end of the day.  These shoes are so comfortable that I am purchasing another pair.
New_Balance,5,I wear a size 10. I usually have to have a 10W but these shoes are a perfect fit. I wore them to Disney World and I couldn’t have made a better choice!
New_Balance,5,I wear a size 7 in Nike. So I ordered a 7 they are a little bit to small should of gotten a 7 1/2 it and they are tight which I like but some with wider feet may not like so much. Just my opinion!
New_Balance,5,I wear a size 7 women in Nike and the 7.5 in these fit well length wise. They were still a little snug around but it may loosen the more I wear them. Overall they are very comfortable. I am a nurse who is always on her feet so I value good support and comfort. I love that they slip on and off and they are very breathable!
New_Balance,5,"I wear a size 9.5 Wide, these are so comfortable and lightweight. Definitely buying again!"
New_Balance,5,I wear a Women's 9.5 Wide and these shoes fit just as expected.  They are so comfortable and offer a decent arch support.  I have flat feet so the arch can be a deal breaker for me.  But these are just perfect.  I think I may end up buying a second pair.
New_Balance,5,I wear an 8 but had to buy a .5 bigger and they fit snug when you put them on but after about a few wears they form to your feet extremely perfect! I love these shoes! I’ve bought 3 pairs! My feet never hurt and I work 8-13hr shift as a night stocker.
New_Balance,5,I wear an 8.5 in every shoe this was definitely an exception. I would recommend sizing up one full size. They are so cute and comfy
New_Balance,5,"I wear New Balance all the time so I thought I would try these, well I ordered my size, which is a 7m and they were too small. Wanted to  try a larger size but none in stock. Also one of the shoes had a ripple over the toe box. I might have let that go if they weren't too small."
New_Balance,5,"I wear size 11, and fits well for a narrow toe boxed shoe. I know I shouldn’t but they do not cause blisters if worn without socks. Wish they had a little more support but for a slide on shoe it is fantastic. These are my primary pair and have held up in both a rural suburban and city setting. I love these shoes!"
New_Balance,5,"I wear size 12 shoes in ladies sizes. Sometimes they don't even fit. Most I wear men's sneakers and flip flops, as I love in Florida. I also frequent Disney, but tend to get blisters after walking all day. When my boyfriend surprised me with these, I could have cried. I love Disney, for one, and two, I RARELY find a women's shoe that fits, let alone is comfortable. When I say these are the most lightweight and comfortable shoes I've ever worn, understand that I wear flip flops mostly because shoes feel like jail for my feet. I've never had a comfortable shoe, men's or women's. Until this one. I'm torn between wearing them into the ground, and saving them because they are so cute. Also, apparently I have wide feet, and that's why none of my shoes ever fit. Lol"
New_Balance,5,I wear them all the time - they are so comfortable. 2nd pair
New_Balance,5,I wear these all day at work and no foot pain at all!
New_Balance,5,"I wear these all the time for light workouts, they're cute and match everything, they're very comfortable and lightweight. (I don't think it has enough support for higher intensity workouts but I have other shoes for those activities.)"
New_Balance,5,"I wear these almost every single day, so cute! They are so comfortable and easy to slip in and out of. They aren't very supportive so I wouldn't recommend them for cardio or intense exercising. They are perfect for walks and running errands in."
New_Balance,5,I wear these during my workouts every day. They are light. And the toe area leaves room for movement during HIIT workouts! Great Buy!
New_Balance,5,"I wear these every nursing shift...I think they will get worn down a bit on the toe because the fabric is so soft but these are the most comfortable shoes!! My feet don't hurt at all at the end of 8-12 hour nursing shift and I'm on a rehab floor so I rarely sit down.  I get so many compliments, I'm def grabbing more colors."
New_Balance,5,I wear these everyday for work.  6 months pregnant so the wide width on these shoes helps a ton.  10/10
New_Balance,5,"I wear these EVERYDAY to work in. I use to have to change shoes at least twice a day and now I don’t. Thank you New Balance for making a light weight, comfortable show!"
New_Balance,5,I wear these to work and they’re so comfy
New_Balance,5,I wear this shoe to work. It’s pretty comfortable and has a clean professional look.
New_Balance,5,"I went a half size bigger because I have
Another pair that is tight and I wear a 10"
New_Balance,5,I went from wearing converse all stars to these and the 1st day of wearing these out to run errands all over town none of my joints were stiff and sore after walking on concrete/storetile; especially my knees and lower back. Needless to say the Converse have since been demoted to the closet and these Sketchers are my new favorite shoe. I also purchased the men's version for my Husband and he reports less knee and back pain as well.
New_Balance,5,I went half a size up in this shoe size and they are the most comfortable Running shoes I own with great grip on the soles
New_Balance,5,I went to try on the shoes but no one carries wide width.  Live the shoes and wide fits perfectly.
New_Balance,5,I went up a half size. They are extremely comfortable. Very happy with them.
New_Balance,5,"I will be purchasing these shoes again I love them. Great for writing out, running, Walks, or even just to style!"
New_Balance,5,I will never buy any other tennis shoe. I am an RN and work 12 hour shifts on my feet. These shoes are the best I've ever worn! Ever!
New_Balance,5,"I wish I was going to Disney World now!  these are so comfortable, I could wear them all the time :D"
New_Balance,5,I wore these all through Disney world and universal for 5 days. Super comfy!! Highly recommend. I have also washed them twice a d they look great!
New_Balance,5,"I wore these for 3 weeks, almost everyday to work.  Then I ordered another pair!  Love them! My feet are no longer sore and I feel secure and supported, no tripping.  I walk about a mile a day at work, so not much but my feet feel good when I get home and I am throwing all of my other work shoes away.  Already have the pile.  Thank you!"
New_Balance,5,"I wore these sneakers 15 - 25,000 steps a day on a 10 day trip to Italy and NEVER had an issue.  Every picture of me has these sneakers, and I never felt pain, walking on cobblestones and uneven rock all the time. I huge recommend for comfort. I have relatively flat feet, and almost threw in my own inserts for the trip, ended up not, and i was still more than fine.

I'm probably going to buy a pair in another color because they're so comfy."
New_Balance,5,I wore these the other day when I met my son for lunch... He said that I looked so cute with these on.  Very light weight and super comfortable. I need to order more!
New_Balance,5,"I work 12 hour shifts at the hospital and these feel like I’m walking on slippers all day. They are SO comfortable, I want to wear them even on my days off!! Highly recommend."
New_Balance,5,I work as a bartender at a tiki bar on a dock and I am on my feet running all day. I needed shoes that were lightweight and would keep my feet comfortable for up to 12 hours. These shoes were amazing! I would definitely recommend!
New_Balance,5,"I work at a department store, walking around on cement all day. Any feet and legs used to get really sore and these did the trick! Feel very cushiony and soft."
New_Balance,5,"I work at a pediatric clinic and I’m almost always on my feet. By the end my shift, my feet would ache so bad. I bought these shoes and they haven’t ached since
I’m in love, definitely worth the buy!"
New_Balance,5,"I work front desk in a medical clinic and got these shoes because of the price honestly. I just wanted a new pair of casual tennis shoes.

I have been very impressed with how they feel. They look great with scrubs. I have had no foot pain or issues.

I bought a 7.5, I usually wear a 7 at target & oldnavy, 7.5 in Nike and Adidas."
New_Balance,5,I work in a hospital and with kids so I’m always on my feet/running around. I’ve only had these a week and the support and comfort is unparalleled. I have bad knees and hips and these have majorly helped me get through my day. I’m usually a 7.5/8 in shoes-I for the 8 and they fit perfectly. Technology to prevent sweat is great too! Love them!!
New_Balance,5,"I work in a hospital, and I'm constantly running around. I bought these because my previous shoes were causing my back to ache and weren't  comfortable. After a few shifts in these new balance, CHANGED everything! Super comfortable and super cute! Found out also my sister bought the same ones for the same reason and she totally agrees with me!"
New_Balance,5,I work in a hospital..so I'm on my feet 10hrs a day and these shoes have been the best I've tried in athletic shoes..and they have held up great.
New_Balance,5,I work on my feet for up to 9+ hours a day and these do well to keep my feet comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I work with children at a daycare.  I am on my feet all day.  These shoes help me make it through the day.
New_Balance,5,I would buy a half size up!! Other than that so comfortable!! Love them!
New_Balance,5,"I would definitely recommend sizing a whole size up. I am usually an 8 or 8.5 and felt the 9 was still a bit snug. I got the 9.5 and it’s a little looser but I like it that way versus snug.

The insole is memory foam which is also nice. They are very light as well."
New_Balance,5,I would recommend
New_Balance,5,"I would recommend this shoe, love the look, super comfortable and fits great. Excited to workout in it."
New_Balance,5,"I would say to size up on these maybe a half a size. Otherwise, these shoes are amazing. Very comfortable, very fitted. I have narrow but long feet. These fit really snug and keep my foot in place. Would definitely buy again."
New_Balance,5,I would suggest for a walking shoe. I used this shoe for a boot camp type class and they started falling apart immediately.
New_Balance,5,"I would update the sizing to say 'runs small.' Ordered my usual size and shoes are snug - maybe just newness, though.  Overall, very happy with look and comfort of the sneakers."
New_Balance,5,"I’ll work on my feet all day in retail, these are excellent, great cushion and support!!"
New_Balance,5,"I’m a dog walker and I walk maybe 6 or 7 hours a day, sometimes more. I just purchased a pair of NBs (the ones that make you feel like you are running barefoot) in May and wore some serious holes in them . After my search, I saw that these rang all the bells for me — they look good, fit perfectly and now that I am walking, they are some of the softest sneakers I have ever worn.

I’m usually in pain while walking and I feel like these shoes are correctly the alignment for my feet and leg because I feel almost no pain at all. Buy these sneakers !"
New_Balance,5,"I’m a floor nurse, so I needed comfortable shoes to walk/stand in for 13 hours.
They’re not only stylish, but super lightweight and my heels don’t hurt at the end of the day"
New_Balance,5,"I’m a gardener, and wanted to have something that is stable, yet easy to slide on and off. These shoes are great! It’s like being bare foot, but, much better!"
New_Balance,5,I’m a nurse on my feet all day and these are the best shoes I’ve had in a while.
New_Balance,5,I’m a US size 7 about 95% of the time but in New Balance I’m always a size 7.5 which I forgot when I ordered these.
New_Balance,5,I’m going to buy another pair! Light weight and comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I’m in love with these sneakers! They are so comfortable! 10 STARS
New_Balance,5,"I’m NOT a New Balance fan, my hubs talked me into it (for comfort) and I’m 100% glad I did. These are the best thing I’ve put on my feet in a long time & they also come in cute colors. Fits especially well with “no show” socks too 👌🏻"
New_Balance,5,I’m not a person that likes to wear shoes...but these are totally comfortable and I love them
New_Balance,5,I’m not a tennis shoe wearer but these are awesome and so comfortable.
New_Balance,5,I’m not picky with shoes. I like them and they look pretty good.
New_Balance,5,"I’m obsessed with these shoes! I have a pair in another color that I use daily, and I bought the Minnie Mouse pair for our upcoming trip to Disneyworld. They are super cute and definitely will look Disney on the trip, but are understated enough that I wouldn’t feel strange wearing them out and about during my day to day life.

The material and shoe itself is super lightweight, but has great cushioning, so you can walk all day in comfort! I love the tongueless sock-fit of the shoe.

One note is that there isn’t much arch support, which I don’t particularly need, but if that’s something that’s problematic for you, I would consider getting an insert for better comfort."
New_Balance,5,I’m on my feet 10 hrs+ a day at work and I haven’t had a problem with these shoes yet! I ABSOLUTELY love this will be my first of many purchases of new balance shoes.
New_Balance,5,"I’m really happy with these shoes! I ordered both my true size (9.5) and a half size up (10) as the reviews suggested, and I ended up keeping the 10s. They are nice and roomy in the “toe box” and I’m guessing these would be great if you had wide feet or a bunion. I have normal width feet and they fit great also. Super cute for walking to work or going to the gym. I wore them to a music festival all weekend and they were comfy all day and the light grey didn’t show dirt. I don’t think they have enough support/cushion for long distance running, but I only walk, lift, and bike in them so it’s fine. They are slip on without looking like it and they’re trendy enough that I feel like I can wear them with real clothes. Very happy :) would recommend"
New_Balance,5,"I’m really pleased with these shoes. They are comfortable, I work in a hospital so far they are good for an 8 hr shift. No fatigued feet at the end of the day. I’m glad I read the reviews before I purchased bc the do run small. I wear a 9 but bc of the reviews I went up a size(10) and they fit perfect. Will be getting more and in other colors."
New_Balance,5,I’m recovering from an ankle fracture and I ordered these for my trip to Vegas/ the Grand Canyon because I knew I was going to be doing a lot of walking. I wanted a shoe that was lightweight and comfortable and these were perfect.
New_Balance,5,I’m so happy with this purchase! Very comfy shoe with just the right amount of support. I typically wear a 7.5 shoe and happy I followed all of the reviews to say to get a .5 a size bigger.
New_Balance,5,I’m very impressed with how these fit! I’m an 8.5 in Women’s shoes - I’ve gotten that exact size in New Balance before and these didn’t disappoint. The comfort insert memory sole is a nice touch.
New_Balance,5,I’m very pleased with these shoes! Lift weight and comfortable with good arch support. Great shoe for walking.
New_Balance,5,I’ve bought 3 pair of these shoes. My feet are wide and my left foot has problems. I can wear these shoes all day and have complete comfort. . Plus they look great.
New_Balance,5,"I’ve bought two pairs of these now because they’re so comfortable, however I’ve had to size up from my normal 6, to a 7 both times!"
New_Balance,5,"I’ve had these shoes for about 3 weeks now and work in them everyday . They are just what I was looking for , very light weight and comfortable unlike my other shoes I’ve had that are heavy and my feet and ankles hurt by the end of the day . My only complaint would be I had to exchange the first pair I received for a bigger size  because they were to small , so if purchasing these shoes I recommend getting a size bigger , other than that I am very happy with my purchase ."
New_Balance,5,I’ve only warn to walk but that’s what I needed them for.  Perfect fit and so comfortable.  Love the burgundy!
New_Balance,5,I’ve only worn them a few times but they are very comfortable. I wore them all day and my  feet surprisingly never felt tired or uncomfortable. They fit great!
New_Balance,5,I’ve purchased these before. Love the fit.
New_Balance,5,I’ve repurchased these shoes in multiple colors because I like them so much. Highly recommend for a good daily shoe.
New_Balance,5,I’ve worn the heck out of these!  They’re comfortable and lightweight.
New_Balance,5,I’ve worn them for 1 day so far. They are exactly what I expected. I’ve been wearing the 20v6 trainers for months and wanted to give these a try since I was looking for a cute white shoe for only weightlifting. They aren’t as comfortable as the 20v6 but still very happy with them. Has a good amount of room in the toe box 👍🏽

New_Balance,5,"I'd wear sandals year round if I could, I hate shoes that cover my feet...but these, they are awesome!  So light, so comfortable!  I'm going to order another pair!"
New_Balance,5,"If I had to pick the perfect tennis shoe, it would be these."
New_Balance,5,"If you 7.5 size, then you will need to size to 8. I had to exchange mine and they fit me perfectly now!! Absolutely comfortable!!"
New_Balance,5,"If you have a wider foot from heel to toe, this may not be the shoe for you. Had to return them because it was tight around daughter's feet. Toe box had plenty of room though..."
New_Balance,5,If you like a bit of room go half size up. Really nice shoe though.
New_Balance,5,"If you like your shoe to snug your foot then this is the shoe for you. I’ve added arch support insert, but I add them to all my shoes.  Very comfortable. I wear them for my “power” walks. Perfect!"
New_Balance,5,"If you need arch support, do not buy this shoe. They look sleek and stylish but not for someone who works on their feet all day."
New_Balance,5,"If you’re looking for a soft, comfortable sneaker, these fit the bill! I put these on and they are the softest shoe I’ve ever tried on. If your foot is a lil wide-order a wide. These run a lil narrow in the center. But overall, love these❤️"
New_Balance,5,"I'm a nurse and the one thing that doesn't have to be uniform is our shoes. I love pink, so I ordered the light pink shoes! They do run a little small, I like shoe inserts since I am on my feet all day. I had to cut the inserts at the ball of my foot because my toes were a little tight, but after I cut them they fit perfectly. I wear 6.5/7 just depending on the shoe, and I ordered a 7 in this shoe. I get compliments daily on these shoes (reference, I'm 27- you don't have to wear puma's to be cute). I have already sent the link to 4 of my co-workers. Definitely will buy again!"
New_Balance,5,I'm a preschool teacher and these sneakers are perfect for my long day.
New_Balance,5,"I'm a size 11, these sneakers make my feet look like a 7!
Also, they are sooooo comfortable & fashionable... I'd like these in every color!!! I love them!"
New_Balance,5,I'm flat footed with RA. I've always worn Nikes and believed they were the best fit for me but these were a million times better than anything I've worn. I'm ordering more.
New_Balance,5,"I'm glad I read other reviews before purchasing and went up a full size from what I would normally get.  They fit great and are super comfortable, but would have been too small if I went with my normal size.  Very light weight!"
New_Balance,5,"I'm impressed with this shoe. I got a pair to go to the gym. It's comfortable and the design is modern, also I loved the color because I can match with lots of clothes."
New_Balance,5,"I'm loving the color and feel of these New Balance shoes, super cute! I just hope they are durable, especially the fabric around the front, it seems thin. Time will tell. But great price and extremely comfortable,  definitely fit my 11 wide foot perfectly!!"
New_Balance,5,"I'm normally a size 9 but these were a little to small to actually run in. Should've ordered a 9 1/2. Other than that, they're super cute, comfortable and casual running shoes."
New_Balance,5,I'm so happy I read the reviews regarding to the size issue. I'm typically an 8 1/2 wide in shoes. I purchased a size 9 1/2 w and they fit great with still a small bit of room for my toes. These are so comfy and overall feel great walking in them. You definitely want to make sure to go up two sizes. I'm very happy with them they are perfect for my walks around my neighborhood.
New_Balance,5,"I'm very glad that I bought these shoes. I first got the red ones at Dick's Sporting Goods on clearance when I was just looking for some casual tennis shoes. But I also needed new shoes for work - I'm a 25 year old woman in a *casual* business casual office setting. My main concern was comfort, so I got on Amazon and found the same shoes in black / gray. I usually wear black leggings, a nice shirt, and a cardigan sweater to work and these black shoes go great with it. One of the middle-aged men at my company complimented me on them and seemed sincere. Then one of my female coworkers around my age took the time during a meeting to instant message me and tell me that they were ""fresh AF"", and they were the first thing she noticed when she walked into the meeting. So nice to hear things like this! They're very comfortable and fit well. I wear a size 7 in most shoes. I've been wearing the black ones every work day for a couple weeks and not much visible wear on them so far. I usually wear liner socks with these to work at least because the sides do come down far, but it looks good in my opinion...always liked the ""low pro"" look :)"
New_Balance,5,"I'm very happy with these shoes! I have room in the toe box and the length is just right. The inside is soft. There are no seams to rub against my toes when my feet swell. I have worn these at home and in the yard without socks - I've never done that with any other shoe. I managed to outpace my kindergartener in the park on a 90 degree day. I thought the drop for the ball of foot area would require an insole, but so far it's not a problem. Please make more Fuelcore Nergize! And please don't change the toe box sizing, length and seamless construction."
New_Balance,5,Impressed at how lightweight these shoes are. Used for elliptical and they were very comfortable. I measured my foot length and width to use sizing chart and bought 6.5 wide and shoes fit perfectly.
New_Balance,5,Incredibly comfortable shoes that fit like a glove! Very pleased with their performance while speed walking and cross training.
New_Balance,5,It fits my feet perefctly. Being wide feet it works. I appreciate the light weight because I'm on my feet all day at work.
New_Balance,5,"It has been hard to find a size 8.5 Wide online so i was very happy you notified me when this great shoe was back in stock.  I have been walking with a heavier pair of sneakers and getting leg-weary.  These shoes are easy to get into, wrap around my feet securely to give me good knee and ankle stability and they look and feel great for walking.  I am a Fit Bit Gal and try to get my 10K steps in daily.  Sandi in Florida"
New_Balance,5,"It is a comfortable shoe, however I usually wear a size 8.5 but these where a little small my toes where to the tip. Im returning and ordering 9."
New_Balance,5,It is a cool tennis shoe. My feet can breathe in them. They look great and go well with everything.
New_Balance,5,"It is a little tight, but I am going to give them a try.  I hope they relax a bit.  They feel good so far, the jury is still out on how they will feel after wearing them all day at school."
New_Balance,5,"It is very comfortable walking shoes.  I walk every day with it. I think it is perfect for spring and Fall but I am not sure if it is summer, it may be little too warm? I am not sure."
New_Balance,5,"It is very hard for me to find comfortable shoes. These are so comfortable I’m going to buy another pair, or two. 😉"
New_Balance,5,"It is very hard to buy shoes online so I relied a lot on the reviews. I love these shoes so much! They are very comfortable and just what I was looking for. However, no one mentioned in the previous reviews and I didn't notice in the description, that these are really slip ons. There is no tongue. Still love them and I'm even thinking about buying a second pair before they go out of stock.  I like wearing them with and without socks."
New_Balance,5,It literally feels like ur walking on sponge... def my most comforable shoes LOVE IT!!!
New_Balance,5,"It looks great!  Fits great!  And perfect for the gym or walking.  The best part is that they aren't bulky, they're just right."
New_Balance,5,It matched my 18 month old daughter’s diaper bag.  She was very impressed!  Comfortable and nice looking too.
New_Balance,5,"It seems they run a tiny bit large, otherwise perfect! They’re comfortable right out of the box! I’m so glad I got them."
New_Balance,5,"It took a couple days to break these shoes in, but once that happened, they feel great."
New_Balance,5,It was great
New_Balance,5,It was the light and comfortable. Very happy with my purchase
New_Balance,5,It’s a little tighter than expected for wide width
New_Balance,5,"It’s a perfect pair. It fits right, very comfortable to wear for my 12 hour shifts and it is very light also.
Will be getting another pair, maybe 2 of different colors."
New_Balance,5,It’s definitely not a running shoe. It doesn’t hold your foot in the shoe. It’s a nice walking shoe and is very comfy. I’m a very wide 8.5 so normally I get a 9 in shoes but in Sandals I’m an 8. So the 8.5 wide for perfect.
New_Balance,5,It’s hard to find comfortable wide width sneakers.  I always have good luck with New Balance.  This look great and and fit well.
New_Balance,5,"It’s hard to find cute, wide width sneakers and these are just that! Super cushy foam insole, sock-like fit around the ankle that makes my wide feet look sleek and a trendy fall color (burgundy)...everything I wanted in a sneaker. They do seem to run about a half size small compared to other NB or Nike sneakers. Looking forward to buying the navy with gold accents next."
New_Balance,5,It’s like wearing slippers!
New_Balance,5,"It’s tough to find comfortable, stylish, wide shoes. These are just what I was looking for! Sleek, modern, and breathable. Nice and roomy in the toe area."
New_Balance,5,Item arrived quicker than expected. Fits as expected!
New_Balance,5,It's like walking on a plush rug.  Sneaker  is comfortable & keeps foot aligned with leg & spine.  great product.
New_Balance,5,It's really comfortable. I recently had a foot surgery. And my toe is very sensitive. This feels really comfortable and gives a cushiony feels.
New_Balance,5,Its so comfortable
New_Balance,5,It's very comfortable
New_Balance,5,its very comfortable. I wore this 12hr at work. I'm pleased buying this.
New_Balance,5,"I've been obsessed with these sneakers since I saw them online last year.. but of course they were sold out everywhere so when I finally found them here, thanks amazon! I knew I had to get them. I'm a true 8 1/2 but has to size up to 9. They can be a little tight to get in at first but with every use it gets better. I have no complaints. Been working out in them for almost a month now and they're very comfortable. I've also gotten a ton of compliments. These are a must have for any Minnie Mouse/Disney lover."
New_Balance,5,"I've been struggling to find a workout shoe that is lightweight but also gives me support. This shoe is perfect for that. It's perfect for running, but also for using everyday to run errands. I've already bought two and I'm tempted to buy another pair in another color."
New_Balance,5,I've bought these shoes twice now. I'm on my feet for 10-12 hours a day and these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.
New_Balance,5,"I've had a difficult time finding sneakers that were truly comfortable to me. I've tried dozens of styles and brands and returned them all.
These are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever put on my feet!"
New_Balance,5,"I've had other styles of New Balance before, but decided to try these because they were on sale. And, WOW. They are my new favorite athletic shoe! So comfortable, snug fit, and really flattering on the ankle. I've already bought more colors!"
New_Balance,5,"I've had so many compliments on these shoes!  They are comfy, low-profile and great for the gym.  I do fitness classes and they work well for that.  I can't speak to how they would do for running, as I'm not a runner, but I'm happy with these shoes."
New_Balance,5,"I've only worn these a few days for walking my dog, but I LOVE these shoes!!!  They feel great and provide pretty good support, are lightweight, easy to put on and they look great...I'm going to get another pair in a different color.  My previous walking shoe always chafed my heels...the heel of this shoe is padded and SO comfy...thank you New Balance!"
New_Balance,5,"I've returned a half dozen shoes, and finally this one fits perfect!"
New_Balance,5,Just a great everyday shoe. So very comfortable
New_Balance,5,Just as advertised.
New_Balance,5,Just as described
New_Balance,5,just as expected
New_Balance,5,"Just as expected. Very happy with this purchase. Super easy to slip on and off, yet perfectly snug. Purchased for indoor workout."
New_Balance,5,"Just got these in the mail today! I absolutely love them! I usually wear a 7.5 but “sized up” to an 8.5 from reading the other comments. They fit great, but are a wee bit looser then I’d personally like, but wearing thick socks should solve that very easily. Overall happy, and would buy again. But in a 8 if I could do it over without the hassle of an exchange.  (:"
New_Balance,5,Just got these today.  So comfortable. And YES - go a 1/2 size up!
New_Balance,5,Just received them today and tried them on - they are so comfortable! I have a high in-step and they fit me like a glove. I ordered my normal size and they fit perfectly.
New_Balance,5,"Just received these shoes and they are fabulous.  The memory foam makes them extremely comfortable.  They were a tiny bit bigger than I expected as I usually purchase 1/2 size larger in tennis shoes, but they were fine with socks on.  They're slip on and easy to get on, with limited tugging required.  I would recommend them to anyone with foot issues whose looking for greater comfort."
New_Balance,5,Just slightly bigger than I expected but not enough to make me go down a 1/2 size. Very comfortable with plenty of support for my high arch.
New_Balance,5,"Just so everyone knows-these do not run small. They are completely normal sizing. I can fit a 6.5-7. I ordered a 6.5 and they are snug but they fit. They are VERY lightweight for a sneaker, but they seem comfortable."
New_Balance,5,Just what I wanted!  I usually go up a half size with NB shoes and that’s what I ordered with these.  They fit perfectly.  I was amazed how light the box was when they arrived.  The support and comfort are excellent.  Love these!
New_Balance,5,Just what I was looking for in a lightweight black walking/casual shoe.
New_Balance,5,Just what I was looking for. I wanted a lightweight shoe that would give me enough support but be flexible enough to do indoor Zumba and other dance type exercise. You definitely wouldn't want to wear these shoes Outdoors. I add a pair of dance socks when I'm working out on carpet but they are perfect by themselves for other flooring.
New_Balance,5,"Laid back, casual shoe.  Only for walking, I would advise not to use these for running or anything that requires some form of support/bracing. However, they feel like you're walking in marshmellows."
New_Balance,5,"Let me start off by saying that I do not do any strenuous physical activities in general, so I haven't put these to the ""test"" per say. I just wanted a nice pair of athletic shoes for walking around the zoo, mall, theme parks, etc... and also to look sporty with my leggings and hoodies. I always struggle to find shoes that fit my large and wide feet that still manage to look cute that I can walk in all day. These are perfect for me. I wear 11-11.5 W typically and I got the 12W (I've been told you should always size up a little in athletic shoes because your feet swell when you are on them all day) and they are honestly the best fitting athletic type shoes I've ever owned. I actually bought 2 pairs because I want a backup when I wear the first pair out. I know everyone's foot is shaped a little differently and they may not end up being right for you, but for me, they are perfection!"
New_Balance,5,"Light , casual , comfortable"
New_Balance,5,Light and comfortable. My favorite sneakers
New_Balance,5,light and easy to wear. I don't think the fabric would last long but I'm still happy with the purchase.

New_Balance,5,"Light weight,  great for walking"
New_Balance,5,"Light weight, breathable and very comfortable. Great for running errands to cross training. Very light weight, perfect to pack in a gym bag or carry-on.  I’ve worn them with thick wool socks and barefoot-no issues with sweaty feet for either option.

I haven’t had to wash them yet but once I do, I will update this review."
New_Balance,5,"Light weight, very comfortable,  and easy to get on and off"
New_Balance,5,"Light weight. Super comfortable. 8W fit true to size. I might wish the laces were real, in that they are a slip-on and a little snug to slip on with some socks. I will spray waterproof them also because they soak up water a lot if out when it's damp."
New_Balance,5,Light weight. Very attractive on. Easy to clean. Comfy insole. Would definitely purchase again. Wore these to walk around Disney for 5 straight days pregnant & I don't know that any other show could've been more comfortable. Great for the price.
New_Balance,5,"Light, comfortable, and very cute. I may get another pair!"
New_Balance,5,"light, thin, comfortable. what you need for the summer and hot weather"

New_Balance,5,Lightweight cute shoes
New_Balance,5,Lightweight really cute. Wore for a long trail walk and were very comfortable. Great for the price. Was true to size for me.
New_Balance,5,"Lightweight, breathable shoe for use with scrubs.  My feet stay dry and I walk on air!  They tolerate a spritz of surgical disinfectant daily as well.  Close-toed, leather clogs were killing me.  My feet were a sweat stew after work 🤮 and just SO uncomfortable.  I am liberated!  Try them!"
New_Balance,5,"lightweight, comfortable"
New_Balance,5,"Lightweight, comfortable, breathable,  perfect for home."
New_Balance,5,"Lightweight, laces just for aesthetics, literally slip on and off. The most comfortable shoe I’ve ever owned. Black on black is sleek and easy to clean."
New_Balance,5,"Lightweight, perfect arch support for my feet, perfect fit for my wide feet, and let’s air through for the summer heat. Overall, exactly what I was hoping for."
New_Balance,5,"Lightweight, super comfortable and TTS.  Toebox is perfect - not too wide or too narrow.  They also form to the foot so no irritating rubbing anywhere.  Great purchase and highly recommended, particularly for those who are shoe-sensitive."
New_Balance,5,Lightweight. Memory foam. Very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,Lightweight. No ankle rolling. Good grip. I use them for indoor workouts / gym and it’s super breathable and light for machines and weights.
New_Balance,5,Like
New_Balance,5,"Like all the New Balance shoes I have bought so far (about six pairs), these shoes are very comfortable.  I have wide feet and always order the W(ide) size and have been very happy with every pair I've purchased.  I haven't used this last pair yet, just tried them on with no socks when I got them, but they felt very comfortable - has room for socks."
New_Balance,5,"Like clouds on my feet, I will by again."
New_Balance,5,Like everything
New_Balance,5,Like the appearance & fit for everyday use.  Haven’t tried for long distance walking - they’re very light so not sure if it would be enough support. Mainly use for doing errands etc. Always get compliments on the appearance.
New_Balance,5,Like the basic fit.
New_Balance,5,Like the color combination and the nicely fitting arch support
New_Balance,5,like them
New_Balance,5,Like them
New_Balance,5,"Like these shoes. Only disappointment is that they do not have much ankle support, otherwise they are comfortable and stylish"
New_Balance,5,"Like walking on a cloud! I now have 3 pairs of these tennis shoes in different colors and I love them. Very comfortable and also stylish. They have a low profile, so they're pretty cute, as well. I wear them to work every day (work in a hospital and I stand quite a bit) and I can also wear them as casual/cute sneaks. The padding inside is seriously so comfy.

One thing to note is I don't think they are the best work-out tennis shoes ever. I like something a little bit bigger and higher profile for heavy weightlifting or long runs. But I love them for work and wearing around town, as stated.

Overall, highly recommend"
New_Balance,5,"Like walking on a cloud, so lightweight, feel great and true to size! Love!"
New_Balance,5,Like walking on a cloud.  The wide width rocks.  My new favorite sneaker.  Medium arch support - but size up and you’ll have room for an insert if needed.  Great shoe and good looking.
New_Balance,5,Like walking on air best sneakers i ever purchased!!!!
New_Balance,5,"Like walking on air! You'll seriously think they forgot to put them in the box!! So light!
Materials are great, fits as expected! Others suggested ordering a size up, however I stuck with my size 10 and they fit great! My left foot runs a little larger, and it fits perfectly too! Will definitely buy again!"
New_Balance,5,Like walking on air. It's a little bit tight on my right foot because of my bunion. Left foot is amazingly comfortable.
New_Balance,5,like walking on clouds comfortable
New_Balance,5,Like walking on clouds. Only problem is that i have not had the chance to vett their sizes. I got a 12 which i am normally and it was too small.
New_Balance,5,"Like walking on pillows! So comfy and cute too. I am a consistent 8.5 and got a size 9 for more toe room cause these do run small in the toe area. Going to order another color soon, shhhh don’t tell my hubby."
New_Balance,5,Like wearing socks to workout...but with grip
New_Balance,5,Liked
New_Balance,5,"Liked the shoe...very cute and comfy.  Too small, however, and I returned.  I ordered the next size.  Too big, too wide.  Guess this shoe is not for me. Returned the larger size too."
New_Balance,5,liked the way the shoe hugs the top of the foot and heel without being uncomfortable. I like the way the shoe looks on my foot also.
New_Balance,5,"Literally LOVE these shoes!!! So I am usually a 7.5 but accidentally ordered 7.. so I put them on and they were really tight. But after a few wears they got worn in and are perfect fit. I am about to order a second pair. So light weight, so comfy. I wear them daily. I use them to work out in (haven’t went for a run yet) but I have ran around with the kids in the yard. Love them. 100% recommend!"
New_Balance,5,Little tighter than my other 7.5s but I’m still breaking them in. Definitely the most comfortable shoes I’ve had in a very long time. Love them
New_Balance,5,"Live in the city needed dog walking sneakers, something I could easily slip on and off without having to untie. This def fit the bill. There's are very comfy and for every day wear or for someone who works on their feet. I'll note they run a bit small. I'm always a 7, but usually order 7.5 in sneakers for a bit more room. The 7.5 is almost too small so I'd suggest possibly ordering 1 size up."
New_Balance,5,Live the fit.  Feels great.
New_Balance,5,Live these!  True to size!  They are light weight and SO comfortable!! Wouldn’t wear them running Bc they just don’t have the support. Perfect for the Jean and T days!!

New_Balance,5,"Love my new sneakers. Was surprised at how light they are. They are thinner and softer than I expected, but I am not disappointed."
New_Balance,5,"Love my shoes, they are light I get lots of compliments"
New_Balance,5,"Love New Balance bc they are a bit wider of a shoe naturally Than other brands. Loved this shoe for its lighter style and less bulky profile to wear with skinny jeans or leggings, some sneakers just look too bulky and ruin the outfit, but these in neutral gray are great, and being on my feet and lifting for work all day they are great for keeping my muscles from aching!"
New_Balance,5,Love shoe.  Very lightweight and cool.
New_Balance,5,Love the army/olive green color!! Perfect for casual but athletic out and about look. Very comfy too.
New_Balance,5,Love the attached tongue. Can’t slide off my arches!
New_Balance,5,Love the cloth feelimg
New_Balance,5,"Love the color and comfort!  I usually wear Sketchers for casual wear bc of their comfort but I couldn’t find a pair in this color to match my track suit. I decided to give these a try. They are perfect in color, size, comfort. Even got a compliment from my daughter on my choice ~ that’s really high praise!"
New_Balance,5,Love the color and the fit. They are like walking on a cloud.
New_Balance,5,Love the comfort.  On a cruise with them.  Walked everywhere.
New_Balance,5,Love the cushion and grip of these shoes. Very nice looking. Definitely order half a size up. I had to order another larger pair. These are very comfortable shoes for running and walking.
New_Balance,5,"Love the design, just enough not over top
Like the weight being light not heavy or cumbersome
I have achille heel issue and this shoe is one of two shoes I can wear
Will order other pairs
Noticed a lady wearing these and asked about them, walked over 10 miles a day in these with no foot issues besides tired all over"
New_Balance,5,Love the ease of these shoes! So often tenni shoes are bulky and heavy. These are so lightweight and easy to get on and off. Highly recommend!!

New_Balance,5,"Love the look, very stylish streetshoes. They are fairly flat but lightweight and comfortable."
New_Balance,5,Love the looks of these shoes! The other reviews said to size up and I agree with them. I normally wear a size 7 and had to go up to 7 1/2 and honestly I could have even gone with an 8. Super weird cause I don't normally wear an 8 at all.
New_Balance,5,"Love the memory foam and how weightless these are on my feet. Also soles grip floor exceedingly well, eliminating slipping and sliding while doing Body Pump."
New_Balance,5,Love the product. It’s very comfortable and looks great.
New_Balance,5,Love the shoe
New_Balance,5,"Love the shoe but had to return for a size 8 which worked fine; have never worn above a 7 or 7 1/2.  Sea Salt is a pleasant color, and shoe is super light."
New_Balance,5,"Love the shoe! Its comfortable and light. Perfect for running errends around town. I could see these as great light running shoes, if only I was a runner😉
I'm usually a size 7 1/2 to an 8 depending on the shoe. I purchased a size 8 and these are pretty snug on me. Wish I would have bought 1 half size up! I also don't feel like the shoes are wide like other reviewers say, as I have narrow feet and they fit great width wise."
New_Balance,5,"Love the shoe.  Just wished i would have ordered a size 8, instead of 81/2."
New_Balance,5,Love the shoes - great for Zumba.  I did purchase a 1/2 size bigger as I had read the reviews prior to purchase.
New_Balance,5,"Love the shoes and I don't wear them on a reg basis, very light"
New_Balance,5,Love the shoes but they run small. I normally wear a 6.5-7 and had to order a 7.5 in this shoe. Roomy toe box - great for my bunion
New_Balance,5,Love the shoes. This is my 2nd pair
New_Balance,5,Love the slip on
New_Balance,5,"Love the style -- a comfortable ""sneaker""-like shoe that looks a little more modern.  Nice color -- dark without being black.  I have to have a shoe that allows added arch support AND supports the inner side of my foot.  This does both."
New_Balance,5,Love the style and fit!  So cute!  May buy another pair
New_Balance,5,Love the support these shoes give me
New_Balance,5,Love the way they fit and feel

New_Balance,5,Love them very light
New_Balance,5,Love them!
New_Balance,5,Love them!
New_Balance,5,Love them!
New_Balance,5,"Love them! But they are definitely just a casual walking sneaker, to be worn while shopping or for a walk in the park, because they are made of soft stretchy fabric (except for the bottom obviously) and would probably not last long if used for regular, intense, workouts."
New_Balance,5,Love them! Fit exactly as expected easy and comfy! Love the soft feel. Fast delivery.
New_Balance,5,"Love them! Fit perfectly, super cool looking, great arch support and very comfortable. Very happy with my purchase."
New_Balance,5,Love them! Had to return first pair to size up half a size but they are great! Light and breathable! Think I need to get another pair!
New_Balance,5,"Love them! Just wish I went with my true size 8. I read the reviews and it said t size up, but really I could have been fine with my true size. The 8.5 is a little big and loose on my feet."
New_Balance,5,Love them! They are light and comfortable with great support.
New_Balance,5,Love them! They are super cute and comfy!
New_Balance,5,Love them!! Very light.. very comfortable!!
New_Balance,5,Love them!!!
New_Balance,5,"Love them!!! But they run EXTREMELY SMALL!!! I typically wear a 7.5 and sometimes even a 7. I ordered them in a 7.5 sent them back and ordered an 8 and they were still too small! I ordered and 8.5 and they fit but I could even comfortably go up again. Besides the annoyance of having to order them over and over, they are so cute and comfy!!"
New_Balance,5,"Love them, so easy to walk in and get on"
New_Balance,5,"Love them, very comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"Love them, very comfortable."
New_Balance,5,Love them. Comfortable and cute
New_Balance,5,Love them. Comfortable. One of the best sneakers I’ve ever had. I like style. Will definitely get them again.
New_Balance,5,"Love them. Lightweight but not cheap. As most of the review stated, they do run small. I usually wear a 10 rarely a 9 1/2 and never a 10 1/2, but to be safe I ordered a 10 1/2 and it's a good thing I did because I'd be returning them. So, I would order a 1/2 size up for sure. Easy to put on. Comfortable to wear all day and they look cute too!"
New_Balance,5,Love them..perfect theme park shoe. I do have to wear thin socks.
New_Balance,5,Love these
New_Balance,5,Love these and get compliments all the time

New_Balance,5,"Love these but for NB they seem to run a bit small, usually I’m 7.5D in NB but returning for an 8"
New_Balance,5,Love these buy them!!
New_Balance,5,"Love these cross trainers!  Perfect for at-home workouts.  Super light and comfortable.  They do run a bit small, so I recommend sizing up a half a size.  I usually wear 8’s and the 8.5’s fit perfectly."
New_Balance,5,LOVE these fit perfect to my shoe size...I did a lot of walking at Disney (10-15miles/day) and 7 months preggo! my feet didn't hurt once! I'm getting another pair in a different color next.
New_Balance,5,Love these for strength training!!
New_Balance,5,Love these for walking and everyday gym shoe. I have already bought them 3 times over. Definitely not a running shoe. They are super light weight. I usually wear a 9 and i had to go up a half size 9.5 was good
New_Balance,5,Love these for walking shoes. They also are very light but supportive as well.
New_Balance,5,Love these for walking!
New_Balance,5,Love these guys!!! Color olive green is awesome I get a ton of compliments

New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes - lightweight and fit perfectly. Bought these so I would have a 2nd pair of athletic shoes for the gym to alternate, but now I only ever want to wear these. Look sharp and very comfortable."
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes - this is my third pair. Great for just wearing around - nice and lightweight.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes !! I am a nurse and have owned several pairs. Very comfortable and fits to size.

New_Balance,5,Love these shoes!
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes!  Looks without compromising comfort.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes!  Very light and supportive
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes! Available in wide, so no squished toes here! Super lightweight and breathable; and the color is just as shown in the picture. I work in retail and stand on concrete floors 8-9 hours a day. These shoes keep my feet comfortable all day long! 10/10"
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! Bought these to wear for walking to/from the train station for my daily commute. They slip on easily and are super light weight. A huge improvement over the hiking sandals I’d been wearing.
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes! Easy to slip on, lightweight, and super comfy!!"
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes! Especially for the price. I wanted plain black shoes with a white sole that are a real brand but didn’t want to pay $80 to $100. These were $50 and are perfect. Love that they’re neoprene (I think?) around the ankle so they slip on without having to be untied. The back part of the ones I got is actually kind of really dark blue (or a weird gray?) instead of black. I’d have preferred all the same black but I didn’t even notice until I had been wearing them for a month so it doesn’t really matter. I originally got an 8 1/2 and had to send them back for a 9, but that’s my bad. I wear both and lately it seems I get 9s more often. Sometimes I think I should have gotten a 9 1/2 so maybe they’re a little narrow. But they’re still super comfortable and I wear them to walk a few miles 3-4 days a week and for everything else I do while stuck at home due to covid. I’ve had them a couple of months and they’re holding up well. Highly recommend!"
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! Fit as expected and are very comfortable and light weight! Am enjoying them this spring and will enjoy them this summer! Would purchase again!
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! Fit is perfect.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! Have them in 3 colors if that says anything. Comfortable and they look great too 👌🏼
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes! I got them as my everyday work shoes. I'm on my feet most days in the kitchen and my photography studio. They are very comfortable. The laces allow you to tie them snug to your foot, but they are designed for easy slip-on. I found they fit true to size. I usually wear an 8.5 to a 9, most often 9 in sport shoes. Ordered a 9 and they are just right. I also love the color. I ordered the Black and White and I like that the front part of the shoe has a brushed black/dark gray look and the back is true black. Definitely a great purchase."
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes! I had to go up 1/2 size, normaly wear 71/2 had to get 8! I wear these to my HIIT workouts and I love that the heel doesn’t get stuck in the rower foot plates! Very light weight and very comfy!!"
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! I originally ordered them just to wear casually and not work out in... but after trying them on I’ll be purchasing another pair for work outs. True to size and SUPER comfortable!!!
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! I recommend going up a half size. I did and I’m so glad I did!
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! I typically wear a 6.5 but these arrived and they were an entire size too small. I ordered the 7.5 and I'm really happy with how they fit. They look super cute with leggings and seem like they will wash/dry well!
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! I’m a dancer and the shoes are light and flexible enough that I can dance in them. Super supportive and easy to slip on and off without having to retire your shoes every time. They also look good as are long lasting. I’ve been wearing them for about 3 months not and I walk about 5 miles a day and they are still going strong
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! I’ve worn them for workouts and outdoor runs. They’re light and very comfy. I ordered my normal size (7.5) and they fit perfect.
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes! Its like wearing a feather! They are super light, and very comfortable. I bought then to try running in them but note: these are definitely Not running shoes. However fantastic everyday shoes. I love wearing them."
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! Light weight comfortable.I like them so much I bought a pair for my daughter. Great price
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! Looks cute and comfortable for walking.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! My feet and arches had been bothering me and these are really helping! I can even run in them without pain!
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes! New balance is one of my favorite brands. I have about as many foot problems as you can name: high arches, Achilles tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, etc. I’m also a nurse, so I know the value of good shoes. These are very supportive and a great shoe! Plus they are so cute, neutral, and go with casual, sporty leggings outfits or jeans! But definitely size up a half size! I needed to exchange for a half size up, but the new size are perfect."
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes! Probably the most comfortable shoe I have purchased. Love NB width, style and price!"

New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! Super comfy. I love how they slip on too. True to size. I got my normal size 8W. I would say the wide is still a little narrow in the arch. I’m really glad I didn’t get the 8 regular because of that. Still super happy with the purchase.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! They are great working out! Even comfortable too!
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! They are perfect for my cardio days! They are weightless but still offer the support I need.
New_Balance,5,LOVE these shoes! They are so comfortable and easy to clean. I just toss them in the washer and then let them air dry and they look brand new.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! They are so light and comfortable. I’m ordering another pair soon.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! They are super cute and feel great on. I ordered a half size to to ensure my feet wouldn’t ache. They fit like my true size (size 9) but they still feel great!
New_Balance,5,LOVE these shoes! They fit true to size and are so comfortable and exactly as pictured. My favorite workout shoes I’ve ever bought!
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes! They have helped my feet so much. I have 3 pair now...these are the shoes for me. Got here in a timely manner with no issues.
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes! Unlike most “soft” tennis shoes, these won’t make your foot roll and remain crazy comfortable. RECOMMEND"
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes!! I did size up half a size, just knowing that I always do with New Balance shoes."
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes!! I work in a dental office and needed a comfortable walking shoe and these are perfect. They are super lightweight, and provide me with the right amount of support. Some reviews said the shoe was hard to get on since the tongue part of the shoe is attached, but I haven’t had any issues."
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes!! Super light weight and comfy. Wouldn’t want them for running tho! I got a 1/2 size bigger than normal
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes!! They are seriously so comfortable! I wear them everyday and never want to take them off! The only downside to these is my feet do get hot in them but on the upside they dont make my feet sweat! They are like walking on a cloud! But I guess that just depends on what type of shoes your use to! I usually get cheap walmart shoes.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes!!! Fit perfect great quality
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes, able to slip them on and off easily,  provide support, and fit."
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes, and the color! Great buy!"

New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes, very comfortable!"
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes.  Comfortably and attractive.
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes.  I use them for my step class, lifting weights, and walking around.  They fit my wide foot like a glove and I love that you can still lace them to tighten a little.  I also have a black pair.  They do not rub anywhere either."
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes.  Most comfortable sneakers ever.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes.  They are very light weight and comfortable.  Not sure how long they will last.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes. Almost bought them at DSW for nearly double the price before I thought to look on Amazon. The inside has a comfy memory foam sole for your foot BUT there is ZERO arch support (I have flat feet and prefer no arches). Wouldn’t recommend for a ton of walking if you need an arch support. Otherwise comfy and cute!
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes. Being a nurse, I'm on my feet all day. These are great. No pain!"
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes. Comfy and cute. Broke them in with a workout and they were great.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes. Fit is good. Comfy. Light too.
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes. Fit snugly and have plenty of toe box room. They are so comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"Love these shoes. Fits my wide feet but they don’t look like big boats on my feet. Cute color and style for a sneaker. I don’t use them to exercise, only casual wear so can’t comment on that. I would recommend"
New_Balance,5,Love these shoes. I always wear a 6.5 in tennis/running shoes but heard they run a little small. I ordered a 7 & they're a perfect fit. ****Accurate assessment of them running a bit small.  Very comfortable. My favorite go to shoes. You can keep them casual or even dress then up a bit. Very cool shoes!!!

New_Balance,5,"Love these! The reviews are true, it feels like you’re walking on a cloud. TTS for sure and I feel like I can get away with a thin or thick sock without worrying about if the shoe will fit correctly.

New_Balance,5,Love these! They are comfy and cute!

New_Balance,5,Love this comfy shoe! Like walking on a cloud.
New_Balance,5,"Love this lightweight shoe!  Really lightweight, but provides plenty of cushioned support.  My previous walking athletic footwear (even those by this brand) were heavy, thick or rigid versions.  This one feels really comfortable, and is breathable.  Great for packing on trips, doesn't take up as much room as a regular walking shoe."

New_Balance,5,Love this shoe! I work retail and it has been a life saver. Very comfortable to wear all day and stand in for long hours.
New_Balance,5,Love this shoe! It fits great and is not bulky
New_Balance,5,"Love this shoe! It is so comfortable and lightweight! It's perfect for workouts when you don't want your foot/shoe to slide (HIIT workouts, strength training, etc.)

The only thing to be aware of, in my experience, is the sizing runs a little small.  I am, almost always, a true size 8 in women's shoes.  The 8 was too small, so I returned it for an 8.5 and that was perfect.  This is a great shoe!"
New_Balance,5,Love this shoe! Like walking on a cloud! I sized up half a size and they fit perfectly. The only downside is that there isn't much ankle support so they would not be good for exercise. Perfect for everyday wear.
New_Balance,5,Love this shoe!!  It is supportive enough for running errands and looks great!  Wouldn't consider it a workout shoe but great for casual wear!  Have them in several colors!!
New_Balance,5,"Love this shoe, extremely comfortable and light"
New_Balance,5,"Love this shoe, I have it in 2 different colors. It’s hard to find a cute wide with shoe. This one is perfect! Not only are they cute, but the cushioning is perfect for walking/standing all day!"

New_Balance,5,Love this shoe. Great for working in hospitals and being on your feet all day!
New_Balance,5,Love this shoe. They are stretchy yet supportive and very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"LOVE this sneaker! It's a little slender though, I usually wear size 8 and these are snug, so I would've ordered a half size up if I had known. But I have broke them in now and they are super comfy, very stylish and have excellent support!!"
New_Balance,5,Love this style of shoe. It is so lightweight. I went to Europe and walked everywhere. Then I went to Japan and did the same! It was the only pair of shoes I used. This is my second pair because I wore the sole out!
New_Balance,5,Love thus brand feels great in my feet and fits perfectly. Will order again.
New_Balance,5,Love wearing these shoes all day .... looks great
New_Balance,5,Love! Love! These shoes! These have to be my favorite casual shoes ever! I wish I could bottle the comfort up into a work shoe!
New_Balance,5,Love! Love! They are perfect for my wide foot. Nice looking too.
New_Balance,5,"Love! My mom is a school teacher in her early 60’s that’s very picky about her shoes, well everything but that’s besides the point. She and I both approved the style of these and she loves the all day support these offer!"
New_Balance,5,"Love! These are so comfy and cute, I get compliments on them all the time. Plus, the pink seems to go with everything.

Definitely runs small though. I’m between a 6.5 and a 7 but ended up fitting in the 7.5."
New_Balance,5,Love!! I’m a lab tech and I’m always running around the hospital.  I love these shoes so much.  I’m an 8 I got an 8 and they’re nice and roomy and comfy. I got the charcoal pair too and those ones are a little snug compared but not too small - so sizing isn’t consistent ... but I still highly recommend.  They go great with my FIGS
New_Balance,5,"Love!! Rarely on foot due to spinal difficulties, so the fit is important. Shoes feel wonderful , even when feet swell , due to mesh like fabric. As a plus, once tied they can be just slipped on & off."
New_Balance,5,"LOVE!!!
These are the most comfortable, lightweight sneakers ever.
Excellent quality"
New_Balance,5,"Love, love this shoe! Fits my narrow foot. They run small, if you have a narrow slim foot these are perfect."
New_Balance,5,"Love, love, love them.  I walk on concrete all day, have a bunion, am 65 yo and my feet never hurt wearing them.  They are the MOST comfortable footwear I have ever owned.  Would give them 10 stars if possible."
New_Balance,5,"Love, love, love these shoes! My daughter and I each got a pair in another color on Black Friday last year. After rotating my first pair out every other day for a minimum of 3 miles of walking, I retired the old pair and bought these. The Fit was consistent with my normal shoe size, they are comfortable and I get tons of compliments on them!"
New_Balance,5,"Love, Love, love these shoes! They are so cute and so comfortable."
New_Balance,5,Love. Looking to buy more in different colors. Light weight and comfortable.
New_Balance,5,Love. So comfy. Super cute! Very happy with purchase
New_Balance,5,Loved it and very light weight
New_Balance,5,"Loved the cheetah print, super cute. Dont really like the cheap looking gold they used for the nb label. Super comfy but I'd change the laces if you're going to work out. My new favorite shoes without a doubt 😍 I normally wear a 7 amd i ordered 7.5 and they fit perfect."
New_Balance,5,Loved the comfort and flexibility and lightness. They are perfect for #RhythmWalking and felt good during the 5k.
New_Balance,5,Loved the look and feel. They were just too small.  Bummed me out as I waited almost three weeks to get them now I have to wait again for my refund.
New_Balance,5,Loved the shoes once the right size arrived. Had to send back the first pair.
New_Balance,5,Loved the shoes! Def loose as they’re mesh. Definitely no arch support if you need it. Very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"Loved the wider tie box - accommodates my bunion.
Super comfortable for standing all day!"
New_Balance,5,Loved them just what I was looking for
New_Balance,5,Loved this product and worth the money
New_Balance,5,"Loved this sneaker. Lightweight, feet breathe in the shoe, fits well, and really good looking. Bought a size up as suggested in some reviews and it fit perfectly."
New_Balance,5,Loves these shoes...this is my second pair. The memory foam insert didn’t holdup as well as I had hoped but I was wearing them almost daily. Slipped in a Dr. Scholl insert and wore them for an additional few months. They wash up great in the machine.
New_Balance,5,Many shoes say wide but then squeeze your feet to death. These were so perfect and fit wonderfully. I am a size 7w so I went up to a 7 1/2 w to be safe because I want to put orthotics in the shoes and it worked perfectly. I am so pleased with this purchase and plan to buy a few other colors if they become available.
New_Balance,5,Me encantaron
New_Balance,5,Me queda impecable y es muy fresco lo recomiendo para media estación.
New_Balance,5,Memory foam is the best
New_Balance,5,Memory foam sole is very comfortable. Like the grey on grey so it goes with everything. Have received lots of compliments when wearing these
New_Balance,5,Mine and my daughter's favorite shoe
New_Balance,5,More comfortable than ballet flats. I bought them to teach in all day. I wanted something cute and stylish with some support. I would not choose these for workout shoes.
New_Balance,5,Most comfortable and supportive.
New_Balance,5,Most comfortable cute shoes out there.  I love running in these.  I have them in light grey and now conch shell.  Can't wait to get more colors!

New_Balance,5,Most comfy shoe ever!
New_Balance,5,Mother love it
New_Balance,5,Must have them in every color!

New_Balance,5,"My daughter loved these, made a great Christmas gift! She said very comfortable shoe, fit was perfect."
New_Balance,5,My daughter loves them an often forgets she wearing shoes
New_Balance,5,My favorite athletic shoe on the market!
New_Balance,5,My favorite pair currently!  Although I was a bit worried initially straight out of the box because it looked really wide and I have very narrow feet but surprisingly they don’t feel as wide and is very very comfortable.  Only problem is that after 2 weeks of use the inside sole started to peel off.  It’s not to bad just a little lift but the comfort makes up for it..would recommend!
New_Balance,5,"My favorite pair of sneakers I’ve purchased in a long time! Super comfy, true to size and easy to clean!"
New_Balance,5,My favorite shoe! On my feet all day so I need something lightweight but supportive. My favorite by far.
New_Balance,5,"My favorite shoe. I never want to take them off. I bought them for work and they are amazing. SUPER light, comfortable."
New_Balance,5,My favorite shoes I have them in two different colors. I use to only like Nike free style but I found these and like them just as much.
New_Balance,5,My favorite shoes to work in! I work super long hours in a massive hospital & my feet never hurt. I walk on average 7 miles on concrete floors. I can not recommend these enough!!
New_Balance,5,My favorite workout and on the go shoes.
New_Balance,5,"My feet have become very sensitive and I was looking for something that would be ""cushy"" and baby my poor old feet.  I found it! These are perfect.  They are slip-on with laces to make snug if need be. They are not a real athletic shoe with some protection, but it is exactly what I was looking for, a light, very comfortable walking shoe or exercise shoe.  The memory sole inside does not come out, but it is a wonderful feeling on my feet.  I hoping the memory foam will last a long time and not break down too soon.  I would purchase these again."
New_Balance,5,"My foot Doctor said new Balance are the shoes to wear. I wear them most of the time, they
feel good and great for walking. the balance shoes  I bought here, look stylish and were different, the reviews were good, and  number one selling, I really like them. go's with most things, I like the look, little different from other shoes. I bought the wide in 8 1/2 larger but wasn't sure ordering on line. their fine."
New_Balance,5,My gf loves them.
New_Balance,5,My granddaughter loves these sneakers.  She wears them to work at urgent care and she says they are the most comfortable sneaker she has ever worn.
New_Balance,5,My house is all hardwood floors and I need to wear sneakers inside. I wanted a sneaker that I can slip on and provide support for plantar fasciitis. These have been super comfortable and they look great with anything!
New_Balance,5,My issue started with Plantar fasciitis ! Wow the pain.. to resolve the problem I had to purchase orthopedic which were very pricey.  So I found that New Balance sneakers have the arch that I need to help my problem.  Thought better to try these at $40 verses $85 in orthopedic.  So I tried them and all I can say is AAAHHHHHH!  They are so comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"My job requires me to stand on my feet all day, and these shoes have been perfect. I love the clean, simple look, and I get compliments on them all the time. I liked them so much I bought a second pair so that I can have a pair for running and a pair for everyday wear."
New_Balance,5,My last New Balance gym shoes were an early Minimus version and lasted several years of almost daily gym visits. No longer available. Ugh! I was looking for something similar with maybe just a little more cushion in the sole and found these. Score! Extremely light and comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"My mom has had a hard time finding a pair of comfortable walking shoes for a really long time and gave up, but she just absolutely loves these. When she asked for a pair of walking shoes I went straight to New Balance because they are a reliable brand. The soles are not to thick that she could trip and it has just the right amount of insole and just an overall great feel and fit for her. TY New Balance!"
New_Balance,5,"My Mom has issues with shoes (she's 87 and had her hips replaced).  New Balance was highly recommended by her Orthopedic Doctor.  So, now I always get New Balance!  I wear and bought size 8.  At first I thought these shoes were too small, however, I wore them anyway hoping they would stretch.  They were fine as is... and they are the most comfortable shoes I own!  My toes have plenty of room and they are very light.  I use them mainly for working out at a gym."
New_Balance,5,My most comfortable and favorite pair of shoes. Money well spent. I stay on my feet a lot and need the support and these shoes carried me thru my busy day.
New_Balance,5,My mother said these shoes were perfect for her active lifestyle. She said they were so light and didn’t know she had them on.
New_Balance,5,My NB shoes are so very comfortable. I went online tonight to buy another pair in a darker color as I have the pink. I was so disappointed to see they are no longer available. Please let me know when they return.
New_Balance,5,My new favorite shoe for comfort. Feel like I'm wearing slippers. So light weight.
New_Balance,5,"My new favorite sneakers, I love them with be buying other colors!"
New_Balance,5,"My niece has these shoes and I loved them on her. She sent me the link and I ordered a pair. Love them. They fit perfectly, very lite weight and comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"My old New Balances no longer supported my everyday walking, normal wear. I bought these & I wear them all the time. Doing house work, grocery shopping and daily walks with the dog & toddler. Going to buy more in different colors! My sister in-law wears them during here shifts as a scrub tech, she recommends them too!"
New_Balance,5,My only comment is that getting it on easily depends upon the thickness of the socks because they are slip on with elastic.
New_Balance,5,My other best purchase so far love this very comfortable
New_Balance,5,My right toe hurts in the toe box. Other than that very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"My second NB pair and I love these. These are super light and comfortable - the only pair I can wear without socks! I usually wear them with socks, especially for training classes, but it’s nice to know I don’t have to, especially if I’m doing a barefoot class and only need these to get to and from the studio."
New_Balance,5,"My second
Pair’"
New_Balance,5,"My shoe size is 8.5, but I ordered an 8 wide and it fits perfectly. The inside is memory foam and the shoe is light. Will provide an updated review after a few weeks of running and using it in the gym."
New_Balance,5,My sister had gifted me a pair during my pregnancy and they are the only shoes I was able to wear up to giving birth. I have wide feet as is and was amazed that they fit my swollen feet. I wore them out so I bought a new pair and they fit exactly the same. I have always had trouble finding wide width shoes that are cute and comfortable so these will be my go-tos from now on.
New_Balance,5,"My third pair, all ordered from Amazon. Super comfy. Fit as expected. I have a wide foot and the wife fit is spot on."
New_Balance,5,My three daughters bought these and told me to do so as well. Love them and so cute!
New_Balance,5,"My wife and I are repeat customers for New Balance shoes. Simply the best fitting, most comfortable shoe on the market, in our opinion."
New_Balance,5,My wife are loving them. They look and feel great.
New_Balance,5,My wife bought these New Balance Women's FuelCore Nergize V1 Sneakers because our waitress RAVED about them so much she had to have a pair. The Chili's waitress spends hours and hours a day on her feet she could not love these sneakers more. My wife just got them but she loves the fit. One cool thing is there is no tung in the shoe so just looking at them I would say they would be like just wearing socks.
New_Balance,5,"My wife has a hard time finding comfortable shoes. Her feet are wide and are ""thick"" on top. These stretch enough to where they aren't overly confining. She is a true 5.5 but went a whole size up to 6.5W just in case. She has some room at the end, but at least she isn't being squished."
New_Balance,5,My wife loved them they look cute on her I would buy them again will make quality
New_Balance,5,My wife loved them.like walking on a cloud of air
New_Balance,5,My wife LOVES THEM says they are best feeling shoes she has. Her calls were hurting bad but no longer with MADE IN AMERICA  shoes at a GREAT PRICE!!
New_Balance,5,My wife loves these shoes!!! Very comfortable and perfect for a Disney fan!
New_Balance,5,"My wife loves this shoe enough that when the original wore out, she jumped at the chance to replace them with the same shoe."
New_Balance,5,My wife says these are possibly the most comfortable shoes she’s ever had. She walks/jogs three miles a day and loves the comfort these shoes provide.
New_Balance,5,My wife tried these on in a store and then purchased on Amazon. She normally wears a 9 but purchased a 9.5 because they are a little narrow. She really likes these and wears them everyday for walking around.
New_Balance,5,My wife was hesitant to order shoes she didn’t get to try on first but they fit well and she really likes them.
New_Balance,5,n b shoes fit and wear well
New_Balance,5,"NB runs about a half size small for me. I needed to order a couple pairs because they all seem to fit just a tad different.  Usually wear 10- bought 10.5, i think NB runs a bit wider than most shoes which i like. Very comfortable- not much break in needed and nice high arch support! Nice and light for summer!"
New_Balance,5,"Needed a comfortable shoe for trail wLking with my pup. Love the style,easy on/off.  Very comfortable to wear even though they are a tight fit. I can’t find the right size...i’m not an 8 any more, and 9 is too big. 8 1/2 is what it has to be so ceno shoe size is 8 3/4."
New_Balance,5,Needed a new running shoe and these fit and work great! They have a nice padded insole that is very comfortable! They also are extremely light so my feet don't get ridiculously sweaty!
New_Balance,5,Needed new gym shoes since the ones I had were worn out. Originally I was looking to buy Adidas but I found these and decided to give them a try. I really love them. They fit so well and are very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,Needed new walking shoes.  I love NB and these fit and feel wonderful.  I love them.
New_Balance,5,"Needed some new shoes for my daily walks. The shoe fits as expected, nice and light on the foot."
New_Balance,5,Needed to half size up and they fit perfectly! Loved them so much I got a second pair!
New_Balance,5,"Needed trainers especially for my bootcamp styled workouts. I had bought Nike which were too tight on my wide foot. Bought Reebok and they tore up the back of my heel & hurt my arches so bad. Bought these, size 8.5 wide, and am so relieved I finally found a pair that I can walk in, lift in, and complete circuits in. Honestly thought they were gonna be cheap and offer no support because they are so light when you pick them up. However the shoe is quality, fits snug enough to support during workouts (not too tight,) and has a really sleek look. Would highly recommend, especially anyone with a wide foot and not the best arches."
New_Balance,5,Never have to break in theses shoes. Only walking shoes I use.
New_Balance,5,"New balance is all I buy, they are perfect for working all day on your feet."
New_Balance,5,"New balance is always my go-to brand for sneakers. These fit perfectly, breathable & cofortable. Well made & should hold up great."
New_Balance,5,New Balance is always the best brand
New_Balance,5,New Balance is my favorite shoes to work in. I'm a RN so I'm on my feet for 12 hours and they feel great. They also last for a long time. The longer you wear them the more comfortable they feel.
New_Balance,5,"New Balance is my favorite sneaker. That being said, why are these so special? Because I love the look! They're going to take me into the fall season with style and comfort."
New_Balance,5,New Balance is one of the few brand that offer wider width for my feet.  This shoe fits very well for me.  Top material is stretchy and top so your feet/toes have room to wiggle but still have enough support for hi-intensity exercise.  This is my 3rd pair of this model and I'll order more to save before it ran out.
New_Balance,5,"New Balance junky! These shoes are so light. I literally am not aware of them all day...my feet breath and never any pain or tiredness. Rare feat for feet! I have 4 pairs at this point..and would buy more if more colors+size was available.
Received compliments from random strangers at the gym and work....I recommend them to everyone."
New_Balance,5,"New Balance makes shoes that work for my feet. This new sneaker is super light, comfy and supportive. The stretchy toe area is ideal for people with toe issues or bunions. LOVE THESE!!"
New_Balance,5,New balance runs small. I'm typically an 8.5 and had to buy a 9.5 but this is my second pair. I love them! Might buy another pair just to have.
New_Balance,5,"new balance sneakers are the best! soft and comfortable, just perfect"
New_Balance,5,New balance styles the big one
New_Balance,5,New Balances are so comfortable and I stand on my feet all day!
New_Balance,5,New Being because of this shoe you will be a new you.  They are super comfortable!
New_Balance,5,New favorite shoes!!! And the fact they come in wide is amazing
New_Balance,5,New favorites!
New_Balance,5,Nice
New_Balance,5,nice all around
New_Balance,5,NICE COMFORTABLE GENERAL SNEAKERS - LOOK GOOD AND FEEL GOOD.
New_Balance,5,"Nice design, comfy and lightweight. I wish they had it in every color"
New_Balance,5,Nice fit
New_Balance,5,Nice shoe but does run small order up 1/2 size. I am a true size 8 and my toe was right to the end of this shoe.
New_Balance,5,Nice shoe for the price. Trying to find a women's  size 12  wide is difficult. So happy with my new shoes.
New_Balance,5,"Nice shoe! I wear an 8 or 8.5 depending on the shoe and I definitely need the 8.5 in this shoe. If I were in the store, I would possibly even try on a 9 to see if it would be a better fit."
New_Balance,5,"Nice shoe, but I ended up going with another brand/style of shoe in the end. However, these are comfortable, well made, and nice looking. The only thing I can say is that I think the sizing is very off on this shoe. Even after buying a FULL size larger than I ever would, they were still too short in length. And if I would have gone up yet another half size, they would have ended up being too wide then. So I returned."
New_Balance,5,"Nice shoe, very lightweight but decent ankle support."
New_Balance,5,Nice shoes
New_Balance,5,Nice shoes especially for price
New_Balance,5,"Nice shoes, comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"Nice shoes, just needed a bigger size."
New_Balance,5,"No, I not IMelda Marcos or her ghost. Yes, I have purchased numerous shoes in search of a holy grail. And  at last I have found one that for my feet and their physical problems are excellent. The rest lies in the hands of an orthopedist. I will purchase again. I do hope that the last do not change , the qualtiy of workmanship and the material with which they are made."
New_Balance,5,"Normally a size 7.5, got a size 8 and it's a little tight around the toes, but will hopefully break in. Otherwise comfortable and good for the price. Light and not bulky."
New_Balance,5,"Normally I wear a 7 1/2 Wide in New Balance. I usually stick with NB because I can find the wide width and the  insoles are removable so I can wear my orthotic. However, I missed the part in the description that these were pull-on shoes and not lace ups. I have a high instep and could barely get these shoes pulled on. They fit other than the struggle to get them on. I decided to return and order an 8W and glad I did. The news ones came today and I can get them on without a struggle and are so comfortable. I love this light-weight shoe. An added bonus, the larger size was $15 cheaper!"
New_Balance,5,Not a lot of support but really comfortable and nice looking. Great for wearing all day.
New_Balance,5,Not alot of cushion inside but very light to walk in
New_Balance,5,"Not kidding. These are so comfortable. I keep wearing them barefoot because they are just so easy to slip on every day and wear all day. I work out in them, do everything. Love love love. Will prob buy another pair."
New_Balance,5,Not supportive at all. Also runs small. Returning
New_Balance,5,Nurses dream shoe!
New_Balance,5,"Oh my gosh these are everything! They are cute, comfortable, breathable, and light. The gray color that I ordered is a nice light colored grey that isn’t over powering in color and looks good as a neutral shoe with all of my old wardro oh my gosh these are everything! They are cute, comfortable, breathable, and light. The gray color that I ordered is a nice light colored grey that isn’t over powering in color and looks good as a neutral shoe with all of my  outfits. I love the design of the shoe in that it doesn’t make your foot look big but actually is quite slimming. The shoelace design holds well when tightened and poles tight well. I’ve use them now for a while and walk daily with no sore feet when I get home and no blisters.. do you shoes went from box to feed and required very little break in time. They do have room for an insert if so desired but for me that wasn’t necessary. I have yet to wash them but they are well constructed so I can imagine they should hold up very well. New balance makes excellent shoes and these are definitely no exception.  The fabric is quality and I love the tab on the back. I actually don’t untie the shoes when I put them on, I just slip the front part of my foot in grab that tab and pull them on the rest of the way. I was a little worried at first about putting them on this way because I thought that it would compromise the tab and cause folding in the back of the shoe from my heel but not so! These shoes go on smooth, stay secured one tight I just slip the front part of my foot in grab that tab and pull them on the rest of the way. I was a little worried at first about putting them on this way because I thought that it would compromise the tab and cause folding in the back of the shoe from my heel but not so!

I am I a I get several compliments on them by people when I’m out and about at least once a week. If you’re looking for a comfortable, fashionable, lightweight, and well-built shoe I highly recommend this one! I I am already considering purchasing a second pair as I love them so much!"
New_Balance,5,"Oh what a lovely fit, it is so comfortable, light and a lovely color. This sneakers to me is the best I have bought and love it very much soft texture and fits so well."
New_Balance,5,"Okay, I don't like to write reviews but when I do know that it's great. I know these reviews can be botched majority of the time but believe this one. The shoe is SUPER comfortable. I wear them all day and had no problems."
New_Balance,5,"Okay, I liked these shoes so much out the box that I decided to give them a review.

They're very cute. I have slender feet and I feel as though these shoes fit them well.
The material is light and flexible which gives me the idea that walking in them will feel weightless.

The fit is exact without any wiggle room so you better know what size you are for sure before buying them or you may need to send them back."
New_Balance,5,"Okay, so let me just start off my saying I am an Emergency Department nurse at a trauma center where we always have lines out the door, and I love these shoes! I am on my feet for 12+ hours at a time, and most of that is walking and moving. I rarely stand for long periods of time like some other nurses, but for moving constantly at a steady pace these are great. I originally got these to switch from day to day with a pair of more colorful under armor shoes to give my feet some relief thinking that I would wear these when the other ones hurt my feet but I find myself wearing these more and more!

The material is so soft and the base is sturdy and supportive. I like a medium arch, and this is a small one, so if you need a ton of support these shoes aren't for you. I wear a true size 10 with average width, and I originally got a 10.5 because that's the size they had for the color I wanted, but I exchanged them for a true 10 in a different color. I got the conch color and it came true to picture. The first pair I got was true to the color as well.

You can't beat these shoes for comfort and price!"
New_Balance,5,OMG I LOVE THESE SHOES!
New_Balance,5,"Omg my back doesnt hurt anymore!! Im so happy. A week ago I ordered a known brand and my back ached. I decided on this New Balance with this sleek look and couldn't believe no more back pain with this memory foam inside the shoe. Recommending at my age, late 40's. Nice stylish shoe with comfort"
New_Balance,5,Omg these shoes are so comfortable! I got them for light indoor jogging but they are making wonderful house slippers. You can wear them for coaching kids soccer also 😁
New_Balance,5,On my feet a lot and need comfortable shoes for long days. Unfortunately comfortable doesn't always look good but these are stylish and comfortable. I love them so much I have actually bought a second pair.
New_Balance,5,"Once I got the correct size, they're fabulous. I have many foot problems, corns and calluses on balls of feet and pinky toes that are trying to stand up to salute the world. Work on hard concrete 8 hours/day so foot comfort plays a big part in my happiness. After ordering many work boots and other sneakers, none of which could comfort both issues (enough padding for soles and enough width and height for pinkies) I stumbled across these. My usual size 6.5 wide was too short but the 7 wide proved perfect and I am finally sure to have a comfy shoe at work. Look cute too."
New_Balance,5,One of my best shoe purchases yet! Extremely comfortable and very true to size! For walking on pavement and running errands while still looking put together.
New_Balance,5,One of the best!.... Thanks
New_Balance,5,One of the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever owned. And I have Owned A LOT!
New_Balance,5,"One of the most comfortable walking shoes I have ever purchased. Lightweight, cushioned and a perfect fit. I wear an 8M and that is what I ordered. Fit perfectly. After wearing them for one week, I ordered another pair for working out. Great shoes!"
New_Balance,5,Only shoes I buy now
New_Balance,5,"Only thing I would change about these shoes is getting them in Extra-Wide width for my stubby feet. But otherwise, these performed very well during my HIIT class."
New_Balance,5,Opened the box and immediately fell in love with these sneakers! They look and feel amazing! No need to break them in since they have memory foam. They are breathable so you don’t have to wear socks. Would highly recommend these to everyone.
New_Balance,5,Order 1/2 size up and they are perfect!
New_Balance,5,"Order a half size up! I made the mistake of ordering my normal size and they’re tight! They look great on and the support would have been awesome if my toes weren’t crammed in there. Totally my own fault, I should have read other reviews. Luckily my son will fit into them in another year. I’ll definitely be ordering another pair a little bigger in the future."
New_Balance,5,Order a half size up. I’m so glad I listened to other reviews. They are a very light shoe. I can’t imagine doing normal HIIT workouts in these but they are great for walking the dog and running errands. They are also very attractive.
New_Balance,5,Order a size bigger. If you think you are going to return and order a different size make sure it is available. I wanted to order up and it wasn't available in the color I wanted and all the other options were more expensive.
New_Balance,5,"Order a size up or more! I’m usually a 7 or 7 1/2. I ordered an 8 1/2, but probably exchanging for a 9."
New_Balance,5,"Order them half a size bigger because they run a little small, but they are supper comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"Order up a 1/2 size.  I always wear a size 8 1/2 and had to return them and order a size 9.  Very comfortable, more supportive than the Sketchers I have. Very light, attractive and I’d buy them again."
New_Balance,5,Ordered 1/2 larger. They fit perfect. My regular size would have been too small.
New_Balance,5,"Ordered 1/2 size down for perfect fit. Very attractive and comfortable. Doesn’t look bulky on feet, slender looking."
New_Balance,5,Ordered a size up because of prior reviews fit perfect comfortable first time I wore them definitely recommend
New_Balance,5,"Ordered these after reading a lot of reviews and went up one whole size and ordered in a wide width as well.  They ended up being too big.  I ordered half a size smaller, but still in a wide and it was a much better fit. Thank goodness for Amazon’s return policy!!
I definitely recommend going up half a size. Had I ordered my regular size they would have been too small. As far as the wide width, I’m in between regular and wide and I do have to cinch up the laces a bit with the wide.
Comfy shoe but probably more for casual wear than a high energy/endurance daily work out.
I’d say cute for a Disney trip  for sure."
New_Balance,5,"Ordered these both a half size longer and in D width rather than my normal order, given the reviews I read. Actually didn't need to do either once I got the shoes and tried them on; I could have ordered my regular size and width, and they would have been fine. The larger ones are fine also because I plan to wear them with some thicker socks. Can wear these all day because they are so light and flexible. The flexing cloth makes all the difference if you have foot or toe issues."
New_Balance,5,Ordered these for my wife because they looked great. They came in and my wife loves them and says they are extremely comfortable
New_Balance,5,"Original size was too small. Had to order a size up + get the wide sizing for them to fit. After getting the correct size, they fit perfectly! Great cushion, you can really tell when walking."
New_Balance,5,Originally bought this shoe direct from new balance in my normal size 7. It was a little tight in the toes but decided to keep them anyways. After wearing for a few weeks they were uncomfortable in the toe area. It was too late to return so I gave them to my 12 year old and ordered 1/2 size larger. Got them today and fit is way better. So listen to the reviews and order 1/2 size larger. They are pull on shoes but that is what I prefer
New_Balance,5,Other than the slight narrowness of this shoe they fit amazing and true to size I wear a 9 and that's why I ordered I would buy again
New_Balance,5,"Overall a great everyday shoe. Super confy. A bit snug, I Will order more colors but half a size up! Loved them"
New_Balance,5,"Paid over $60 for a shoe that arrived several days late with a Marshall’s price tag of $39.99. I am laughing while livid. Also they run small. I ordered a half size up and they just barely fit. Buyer beware.
Update: when I raised the matter with Amazon customer service they refunded me the difference. Very pleased with the outcome."
New_Balance,5,Peerfect! My mom love them
New_Balance,5,perfect

New_Balance,5,Perfect fit. Good support. Great quality and value
New_Balance,5,Perfect fit. I wear them daily and they haven’t stretched like some of my gym shoes have. Comfortable!
New_Balance,5,Perfect for a nurse
New_Balance,5,Perfect for day at amazement park
New_Balance,5,Perfect for me and I normally cannot shoes online.  Width is food and I have a wide food and arch.  I sometimes go back and forth between 8.5 and 9.  I may could go up to a 9 next time for toe box comfort.  I have gotten complements on how cute they are.
New_Balance,5,Perfect for my daughter's band competition.
New_Balance,5,Perfect for this hot summer weather slips right on feels comfortable love New balance Dr recommend new balance and try these no regrets

New_Balance,5,Perfect I ordered another
New_Balance,5,Perfect just like the picture and comfy
New_Balance,5,Perfect shoe for HIITs/cross training. Super light and the memory foam is v comfy. Will be purchasing another color again soon
New_Balance,5,"PERFECT SHOES! I have bought 3 pairs! Great sizing!!! Lightweight, easy to clean, and I can wear them without socks because they are made of a nice breathable mesh."
New_Balance,5,Perfect shoes! I have swollen feet due to a medical issue and these fit great over them- usually I can’t wear these kinds of shoes with the tongue attached.
New_Balance,5,Perfect sneaker
New_Balance,5,"Perfect sneakers for walking and work. Haven’t tried for jogging nor hiking. Light weight, minimal, not too low to ground like Merrill brand.
Excellent price for nice looking, comfortable sneakers 👟."
New_Balance,5,Perfect!
New_Balance,5,Perfect!
New_Balance,5,Perfect! My second time purchasing. My converse shoes were not doing it for me. These are way more comfy
New_Balance,5,"Perfect, light weight!"
New_Balance,5,Perfectly comfortable right out of the box!  Love these shows.
New_Balance,5,Pidan un talle más! El nb es un poco más chico que el resto del calzado! Yo encargue uno más y quedo impecable
New_Balance,5,"Pleasantly surprised! Looks great on feet and they are insanely comfortable. They are pretty much true to size but if you like a little more room in the top of toe area, go 1/2 size up. I wear 8.5 on average and my big toe is very close to top."
New_Balance,5,"Possibly the most comfortable shoes I've ever had.  Soles are a little thin, but great for around town.  The shoes are exceptionally lightweight, and well ventilated."
New_Balance,5,"Possibly the most comfortable sneakers I have owned, but they do run small.  I had to return the first pair I ordered and order 1/2 size larger."
New_Balance,5,"Pretty tight in the toe area for an 8.5. I recommend going up a half size. Edit:  I've broken them in now, and they're comfy. Added some gel insoles and they're great."
New_Balance,5,"Pretty, cute and comfortable"
New_Balance,5,Product arrived quickly and just as described.
New_Balance,5,Product fits well
New_Balance,5,"Purchased a pair just before I had knee surgery to wear in rehab. Was very comfortable, and since I am older I did not want shoes that had alot of lacing up. Purchased a black pair and love them also."
New_Balance,5,"Purchased a size 9N. I wear New Balance so I expected these to fit like all the rest. However, they run a tad small. I didn't have time to return and try to order a bigger pair which when I looked would cost more money (the thing I hate about buying shoes on Amazon is that they prices from size to size is not consistent). Anyway, I love these shoes. They probably wouldn't work for a long walk around Disney World (which was what I had hoped to use them for). However, they are fine for short walks. There really just isn't enough support to do a long walk with them and not have sore feet."
New_Balance,5,"Purchased as a Christmas gift for our daughter, she was thrilled to get them"
New_Balance,5,Purchased as gift for my daughter-in-law. Had to return original pair and size up a half size. My daughter-in-law sent me a note saying new size fit perfectly and she loves them.
New_Balance,5,"Purchased for my wife and they're her favorite shoes for shopping, walking, jogging, and exercise. They're comfortable, dry quickly, and very supportive even with being so light weight."
New_Balance,5,Purchasing sneakers online has always been a challenge until I found these. I got a size 6 aNd it fit like a glove. I think it’s true to size.  I’ve never been more please. Light weight and very cute. They’re so nice I had to buy it twice! Love it.
New_Balance,5,Qué son muy cómodos sobre todo para mi pie que es un poco des complicado
New_Balance,5,Really cute and stylish
New_Balance,5,Really cute shoes and fit well. I know I take a wide in New Balance and these fit as expected. They lack the arch support and cushioning that I would expect from a workout shoe/cross trainer but I plan on just using these as a casual shoe and maybe walking around Disney.
New_Balance,5,"Really cute shoes with moderate support. I have super hi arch, so easily added my orthotics. Only complaints are: laces don’t stay tied and tongue isn’t separate so they aren’t as supportive as a regular tie shoe. I won’t exercise in them, but wear everyday to/from gym. Love that they are ALL black!!!"
New_Balance,5,"Really cute! CAN be comfy, with some breaking in. The shoes feel really sturdy and great quality. They are a little on the small size so I suggest ordering up a size or a half size; I also recommend breaking them in a little bit before wearing them to the gym!!"
New_Balance,5,really enjoy wearing those shoes.  they are so very comfortable and well worth having.
New_Balance,5,Really happy with these needed a lightweight very comfortable cushioned pair of shoes for work and these are excellent!
New_Balance,5,"Really like the look of this shoe. They are light and comfortable. I did have to order 1/2 size larger. I bought a solid black pair in my normal, 8-1/2 wide size and they are too short and tight."
New_Balance,5,Really like these shoes.  Very comfortable and fit perfectly.  Love the color.
New_Balance,5,Really liked
New_Balance,5,"Really liked this product. As a Disney lover it's great to have a shoe that's Disney and great for walking. They are very light on your feet and so comfy. As a person that doesnt buy sneakers much, I will probably buy these ones again and again when they get warn out."
New_Balance,5,Really liked this shoe so I ordered another pair in a different color.
New_Balance,5,Received as a gift.  Good fit and comfort.
New_Balance,5,Received my new size. Shoe not true to size. Over they are very comfortable. Still needed a half size up from my reorder. Still happy with the shoes.
New_Balance,5,Replacement for Nike walking shoes comfortable and no break in needed.
New_Balance,5,"Right size, good comfort, stylish too!"
New_Balance,5,Rubs underneath the outside ankle. Ouch
New_Balance,5,"Run a little small. I’m normally an &, but got an 8.5. Wide sizes are hard to find so I was pretty excited. Super lightweight. I have a high arch so I had to add new insoles, but love love these shoes now. I’m in the medical field and wear them for 10+ hours a day... never have achey feet (:"
New_Balance,5,"Run small so I grabbed a size up, so comfortable, my favorite sneakers!"
New_Balance,5,"Runs a bit small, I had to go up a half a size. Super comfy and cute though"
New_Balance,5,Runs a bit small/tight because of insole
New_Balance,5,"Runs a little big but I love these! Very comfortable and light weight! Also, a great price for a quality shoe!"
New_Balance,5,Runs a little small and not a whole lot of support! But they are super cute!!!
New_Balance,5,Runs a little small if you ask me. I went a size up to be on the safe side & its not much room at all. Very comfortable though. Light an breathable
New_Balance,5,Runs about a half size small but really comfy!  Super comfortable! I ordered a half size up (8.5 and I’m usually an 8) - am wearing with my Bombas liner socks and they are perfect.
New_Balance,5,"Runs small in the tow box area, would suggest to order a half size up."
New_Balance,5,Runs small.  Get 1/2 to 1 size up.  Otherwise fantastic! Very comfortable
New_Balance,5,Runs small. I’m a solid 8 in gym shoe and my toe hits the inside in this size 8 shoe. I have to go up in size for a little room in this fit which I never have to do.  The shoe is awesome and light and very good looking shoe.
New_Balance,5,Saving for gym!!
New_Balance,5,"Saw these and purchased, my wife fell in love with them. Looks better in person"
New_Balance,5,Se ven cómodos.. pero mis  en pies no se encontraban a gusto. Alguien con pies más delgados quizás.
New_Balance,5,"Second pair I have bought--these are super comfortable for everyday wear, but I would not recommend for high impact workouts.  They have  been great for long shopping trips and taking walks on the treadmill, though.  Will probably buy another pair when available in different colors."
New_Balance,5,Second time buying. I have high arches so I have to switch out the insoles but other than that they are so comfy. I’ve never worn tennis shoes this much until I got these.
New_Balance,5,"Seem to be true to size, she really likes them and has decent tread. I Will buy more when school starts for gym."
New_Balance,5,"Seriously the most comfortable shoes ever! I bought these because they look cool and the price is right but wow, they are soooo comfortable!  It’s a joy to wear these. I wore them all night at work, and every time I had to walk somewhere, it felt really exciting and fun. I can’t wait to run in them! Definitely go a half a size up. I did, and they fit perfectly."
New_Balance,5,She found the shoes very comfortable and likes the appearance. They are built well and should last a long time
New_Balance,5,"Shipped faster than expected. I am on my feet all day, these shoes are very comfortable and meet my needs. If I order again I would order 1/2 size up or wide. No room for socks with these shoes but so side they’re not really needed"
New_Balance,5,"Shoe fits great, but it DOES RUN SMALL .  I'm a size 6  and i Never have to go up a size but I'm glad i ordered a 6.5 because it fits perfect...there's enough space and I'm sure the shoe will loosen up as I continue wear them"
New_Balance,5,Shoe fits perfect true to size!! Great purchase highly recommend
New_Balance,5,Shoe is exactly as described.  I will be buying another in a different color.
New_Balance,5,Shoe is just right except the top of the shoe feels tighter then the rest but once it's get worn a bit more it will be great  Overall love them. Will buy 2nd pair.
New_Balance,5,Shoe is super comfortable but does run a little smaller than I am used to. I am an 8 usually and would probably order an 8.5 next time but still recommend this shoe!!
New_Balance,5,"Shoe runs small, seems like a good shoe, even without socks the shoe was too short. I am reordering in a larger size"
New_Balance,5,Shoe was perfect but the soft foam doesn’t seem to last in any shoe.
New_Balance,5,"Shoes are comfortable, well made, fit true to size and delivered quickly. Absolutely would buy again."
New_Balance,5,Shoes are light and flexible and cute! Work 12 hours and no issues!
New_Balance,5,Shoes are sooo comfortable. I may buy more pairs
New_Balance,5,Shoes are very comfortable and lightweight.  Good fit and easy to get on and off.  I’m very happy with my purchase.
New_Balance,5,"Shoes are very comfortable. True to size. I normally wear a 7 in the Adidas cloudfoam, but got an 8 with these and they fit perfect. Very light, comfortable and dainty for and athletic shoe."
New_Balance,5,"Shoes fit as expected.  It is my first experience with this style.  I usually wear inserts in my shoes. I can't fit them in this shoe. However, I didn't need them when I wore these. I will order the extra width next time."
New_Balance,5,"Shoes showed up quickly, my wife says they’re the most comfortable shoe she has out of her other NB shoes"
New_Balance,5,show has to get broken in. most wides are perfect but this shoe was a little narrower than expected. but once broken in shoe is amazing.
New_Balance,5,"Since the epidemic, I have not been able to go to the gym and have taken up jump roping for my cardio. Once I built up a little stamina (and stopped feeling like I was going to die after a few minutes), I embraced it. However, my running shoes were just too stiff. I realized I needed a shoe with a lot of ""ball of foot"" cushioning, but also was able to bend mid foot so as to allow for proper form, which means staying on the balls of your feet throughout. I researched ""shoes for jumping rope"" and these ranked quite high on many sites.  When I first got them, I was amazed at how light they were and thought that meant they were cheap. They are not. These shoes have good cushioning and are very bendable allowing me to maintain proper form. They are very light, but are meant to be and that has turned into a positive thing. I have a very wide ball of foot (due to bunions) and I purchased two sizes: 7.5W (for wide) and 7.5 M (for medium or regular) width. I kept the 7.5W and returned the other. I've been at it for months now and they are as comfortable as they could be while supporting good form. I love them."
New_Balance,5,"Size 5.5 true to size, lightweight, comfortable & I would purchase this item again"
New_Balance,5,Size up
New_Balance,5,Size up and get the wide width made a big difference for me especially around the toes!
New_Balance,5,Size up in these sneakers. Own multiple pairs in different colors and all seem to be this way.
New_Balance,5,"Size up its a tight fit, I got an 8.5 and had to go to a 9, could really go up to a 9.5 but overall comfortable. Wear them everyday for work."
New_Balance,5,"Size up with these! I am an 8 1/2 in any other shoe, sandal, or sneaker. I got an 8 1/2 in these and they were definitely too tight. I ordered the 9 and they fit perfect!"
New_Balance,5,"Size up. This is my first time wearing New Balance but I wear a 8.5 in every shoe I wear. These NB 8.5 were a little to small. My toe was RIGHT at the edge. Awesome and comfortable shoe otherwise. Exactly what I was looking for for my 80 day obsession workouts. I’ll definitely order another pair and support a company that makes shoes in the USA 🇺🇸

Update: I ordered a size 9 in the gray shoes they fit like my regular 8.5’s from different companies. Definitely size up 1/2 a size. Great shoes."
New_Balance,5,"Size was a lot smaller. I take a size 9 ,would of ordered a size 9 1/2 had I’d known."
New_Balance,5,Sizing is as expected.  They definitely allow room to move in the toe area (almost too much).  These are very comfortable shoes and are easy to get on and off without untying.  There is an elastic band that goes over the top of the shoe where they are tied; really keeps them in place.  My new go to summer walking shoe.
New_Balance,5,Sizing is small. Had to order 1&1/2 size larger than usual shoe size. Shoe is nice and lightweight.
New_Balance,5,sleek looking and so comfortable! I was hesitant to buy my normal size after reading all the reviews. I'm glad I followed my gut!
New_Balance,5,Slightly a little wide. Need socks.  Love the pull on feature.
New_Balance,5,Slightly bigger/wider than usual fit but very comfortable
New_Balance,5,Slightly small compared to my normal size but oh so comfortable. Not enough support for running IMO but super cute for casual wear. Don’t blister or rub anywhere that I’ve seen.
New_Balance,5,Sneakers are just right. They don’t offer a ton of support if you were going to exercise but perfect for everyday wear. Looks good too.
New_Balance,5,Sneakers fit my feet well. I love the comfort and support this sneaker provides.
New_Balance,5,So comfortable
New_Balance,5,So comfortable

New_Balance,5,So comfortable!
New_Balance,5,So comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"So comfortable! Great for  travel when you want comfortable shoes, but don't want shoes that scream ATHLETIC SHOE!  The material is great, something different. They are very cushy, and I have custom orthotics that fit in perfectly. Looking forward to getting more pairs in other colors!"
New_Balance,5,"So comfortable! I know alot of people are afraid to order shoes online but you have to know what your size is. My foot is a 36 in anything I wear. So when ordering I always look for 36 no matter what the American size is, could range from a size 5 to 6.5. And always Google the shoe from other stores first to know if the shoe you want will actually fit. Do your research!"
New_Balance,5,SO comfortable! These are perfect for crosstraining classes.
New_Balance,5,So comfortable!!
New_Balance,5,So comfortable!!! Even for wide feet!
New_Balance,5,So comfortable!!! Love these

New_Balance,5,So comfy and Cute. I have revived so many compliments.
New_Balance,5,So comfy and light !! wear them as work shoes definitely glad I chose these!!
New_Balance,5,"So comfy and lightweight.  I bought a pair at Kohl’s  and wanted another color but they were to expensive so when I found them on Amazon I was so excited.  I usually wear an 8 but I need a 8 1/2 in these.  There great for walking, or working out but cute enough to wear with shorts or jeans."
New_Balance,5,So comfy and stylish
New_Balance,5,So comfy- but I could’ve used a half size bigger.
New_Balance,5,So comfy! So cool! Love these!
New_Balance,5,So comfy!!

New_Balance,5,So cute an comfy
New_Balance,5,So cute and comfortable
New_Balance,5,So cute and comfortable. Not sure if I would work out in them but love for all day casual wear.
New_Balance,5,So cute and nice quality! They fit a little snug but they stay on!
New_Balance,5,So cute! I get compliments on them all the time. They are a great errands and walking shoe. The to gue is attached so the shoe doesnt tighten much at the laces. I have super wide feet and these work great for me.
New_Balance,5,so easy to take on/off. but no real support because the upper shoe is made of mesh?/soft cloth.
New_Balance,5,So far so good :)
New_Balance,5,So Freaking Cute!
New_Balance,5,"So glad I bought these.  I am a bartender on the side and I did the Farmers Insurance PGA tour, 8 hour days, 26 miles walked and fast paced. These held up nicely and kept my feet from screaming at the end of the day."
New_Balance,5,"So glad I got these! They are so comfortable and look great. Did a lot of walking in them and they didn’t hurt my feet at all. They are very light like walking on air. Other reviewers are right, get a size larger because the front strap can be tight around the foot. I normally wear a 6.5 and ordered a 7 and they fit perfect."
New_Balance,5,"So glad I listened to the reviews. I did order 1/2 size up and they fit very well. The width is also very fitted. Very nice looking, too!  I have a bad hip joint, but they feel pretty comfortable right out of the box. May have to put in some orthotics later."
New_Balance,5,So glad I read the reviews before settling on a size. I have another pair of New Balances and they are a size 7. I read several comments about going up a half size. I got a 7.5 and they fit amazing!  Very comfy still after running around in the them all day for work! Definitely do not need breaking in like some shoes.
New_Balance,5,"So I followed some suggestions from the reviews to order half a size up and I’m glad I did! They fit perfectly which is hard for me to come by. Also, they are extremely comfortable! I work in a vets office and am on my feet all day, so these are perfect!"
New_Balance,5,"So incredibly comfortable. There’s nothing in the interior of this shoe to irritate your feet. Very first day I had them I walked five miles with no socks! They give enough support to be very stable.  If you take the insole out, you can toss them in the washer. Absolutely love them."
New_Balance,5,So light and comfortable!
New_Balance,5,So light and comfortable!!!
New_Balance,5,So light and super comfortable! These shoes do seem to stretch out though. They are still wearable but I wish I had ordered 1/2 a size smaller.
New_Balance,5,So light that I thought the box was empty!  I want to wear these every day!  I love these so much that I sent a pair to my sister.
New_Balance,5,"So light weight and a perfect pair of walking shoes. They do not have the best arch support, but I have my own insoles so it  doesnt affect me. Will be ordering more colors!"
New_Balance,5,"So light weight and comfortable! Definitely not for running, but perfect for wearing to walk around the hospital at work all day. Love!!"
New_Balance,5,So light! The best work out shoes!
New_Balance,5,So light. Love going walking in these.
New_Balance,5,So lightweight & airy. Will be great for summer. My normal size felt a tad snug when I first tried on but after wearing for about an hour they were true to size. I was glad I didn’t size up since the laces are just decorative and wouldn’t allow for tightening. Just ordered a second pair in magnet/rose gold.
New_Balance,5,So lightweight and comfortable!!
New_Balance,5,So lightweight and comfy. You’ll love these!
New_Balance,5,So lightweight and perfect fit.
New_Balance,5,"So pretty disappointed as I've only worn these shoes about 5 times and the loop on the back to pull them on is shredding, that's unusual and now I'm stuck without getting a replacement because it's been 5 months. So bummed and not sure how I can get it fixed."
New_Balance,5,So soft and comfortable! They aren't very supportive but I wear orthotics in them most of the time anyway.
New_Balance,5,Sock like shoe in light weight material. Fits true to size. Very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,Soft and comfortable
New_Balance,5,"Soft and comfortable, however, they do run a little small. I wear a 7.5 in every brand across the broad and this is the first time I had to order size 8 after reading the reviews. And sure enough half a size up from my normal fit nicely. You might want to size up half a size!"
New_Balance,5,Soft and very comfortable! I love wearing these sneakers
New_Balance,5,Somebody comments on these super comfortable shoes every time I wear them!
New_Balance,5,"Something at the top of the shoe rubs and digs into my foot so I can’t wear them. They are defective

I bought a different pair Of the same exact shoe style from the store and they are so comfortable and light and I love them!"
New_Balance,5,Son excelentes muy lindos y súper cómodos
New_Balance,5,"Son perfectas, muy lindas y suaves, fáciles de lavar"
New_Balance,5,Son un poquito más anchas de lo que esperaba.
New_Balance,5,"Sooo cute! My pair was just delivered today and they are absolutely friggin' adorable! They are also VERY lightweight and comfortable. Looking forward to wearing them on my next trip to Disney. I definitely recommend this purchase to any Disney fan, you'll love 'em -"
New_Balance,5,Soooo comfy. Both my girls have a pair and they LOVE them. I decided to give them a try.  So glad I did.
New_Balance,5,"Sooooo comfortable! With my bunions, it’s so difficult to find a shoe that I can wear all day. The black and gray colors match a lot of clothes so I can wear them from work to the gym.  SEAMLESS transition in my busy like is very convenient."
New_Balance,5,Style/ look
New_Balance,5,"Stylish and quite a cute pair of shoes. Light weight, but made well. I noticed I walk normally in these shoes as they don't constrict my feet or ankles or put too much pressure on my arch.
Good but for me."
New_Balance,5,Stylish and very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"Stylish, comfortable and versatile"
New_Balance,5,Stylish.. Great quality.. Great look!
New_Balance,5,Such a lightweight shoe! This is my favorite tennis shoe I own!
New_Balance,5,Super adorable shoes! They are so comfortable.
New_Balance,5,super comfortable and beautiful
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable and cute! I love them!
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable and cute. One thing to keep in mind is they're made more for casual day to day wear than sports/fitness.  I knew that when i bought them but i know it can be hard to tell with tennis shoes.
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable and fits true to size. Maybe a tad roomy because the toe is so forgiving.
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable and light weight shoes. Bought these for my 10 year old to have comfortable shoes to wear at Disney. Then my mom and grandmother bought some for themselves.
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable and lightweight! Loved them so much I bought two different colors.
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable and lightweight.
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable and skip on and off easy. I don't use these for running just casual wear. Not supportive enough for running
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable and stylish
New_Balance,5,"Super comfortable but no ankle support. With my previous Puma shoes my toes would go numb within the 1st 20 minutes of my workout. These NBs are perfect for my HIIT but I did needed to purchase an ankle brace for added support. All in all, I would definitely buy again."
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable for walking and stylish too
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable shoes.. I had read on the reviews that it was to small but the size I ordered was perfect..
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable!
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable! I am on my feet all day for work and it’s nice that these are light but still comfy and supportive. I do feel like they’re alittle slim at the toe box but they have some give so it works out fine.
New_Balance,5,"Super comfortable, and allows your feet to have air circulation, so I would not recommend lengthy time in snow with them. I like that the are solid black too"
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable. Good for plantar fasciitis. Highly recommend.
New_Balance,5,"Super comfortable. I work in a hospital, always on my feet and they’re great to wear.
Only thing I’d be mindful of, is they’re light in color so tend to show stains much easier.
They’re also easy to take on and off."
New_Balance,5,"Super comfortable. These are my go to slip on shoes for running errands. I’ve ordered them twice I like them so much. I’m a size 8.5-9, ordered a 9 and they’re perfect."
New_Balance,5,"Super comfortable. They fit perfectly and don't hurt at all. Light weight, easy to put on and off."
New_Balance,5,Super comfortable...a little hard to get on...they aren’t the easiest slip on sneakers...but comfortable.
New_Balance,5,Super comfy
New_Balance,5,Super comfy & slip on
New_Balance,5,Super comfy and a great price! The regular New Balance shoes are like $60-120 and I found these online and thought I’d give them a try. They fit perfectly and feel like I’m walking on clouds.
New_Balance,5,Super comfy and for the price is awesome.. I have bought this before from Sketcher store and here in amazon are cheaper.
New_Balance,5,Super comfy and light weight.
New_Balance,5,Super comfy and very light
New_Balance,5,Super comfy but no grip
New_Balance,5,"Super comfy fashion walking shoes. They run narrow and small, so absolutely order at least 1/2 size up, and if your feet are anything but super-narrow, also order the ""wide"" option. I am usually a standard size 8, and I got an 8.5 Wide and they are just on the edge of being too short -- a 9 Wide would have been even better, so size up! If you get them in the right size, they are great!"
New_Balance,5,"Super comfy material, very light weight, easy to slip on - soles aren’t shaped or molded in any way but they do have a good, soft squish to them so I feel supported. I work 3 x 12 hr shifts & my feet feel fine after :)"
New_Balance,5,"Super comfy shoes for my flat feet! They are my go-to shoes for sure, perfect fit and nice feel on the insole. Ties and tightens easily and securely. Good price. They look good too!"
New_Balance,5,Super comfy shoes!! My new go to gym shoe and even every day!! Loveeeee!
New_Balance,5,Super comfy shoes. They feel so nice to walk in. They fit as expected as well!
New_Balance,5,"Super comfy, def go up a half size, my only thing is the one shoe feel narrow. But could be how I walk lol but overall thess are great!"
New_Balance,5,Super comfy. Hate that the laces constantly untie unless double knotted tightly but worth the comfort
New_Balance,5,"Super comfy. If your feet are not thin, I’d recommend getting a .5 size more. I have tiny feet and they fit perfectly. A little tight toe box but I can deal with it. I’ve been a big fan of New Balance and I’m satisfied with this product."
New_Balance,5,Super Cómodos!!!!
New_Balance,5,"Súper cómodos,me encantaron♥️Yo soy número 7 y los pedí 7 me quedaron perfectos"
New_Balance,5,Super cute
New_Balance,5,Super cute and comfortable! I wear them all day at work and working out. Absolutely love them!
New_Balance,5,Super cute and comfortable. However they do run about a half size smaller than all of my other new balances. Thankfully they didn’t have a 5.5 which is why I ordered the 6.
New_Balance,5,"Super cute and comfy shoe, but not great for running or cardio classes. Just not that supportive."
New_Balance,5,Super cute and comfy shoes! I love the light grey color! The memory foam is great. Just make sure when ordering anything with memory foam go up a 1/2 size.
New_Balance,5,Super cute and comfy. The memory foam insert really helps make the shoe feel supportive. They are also very light weight making them a perfect choice for travel. I bought these as a back up pair because I love them so much I wanted to make sure when my originals are worn out I have another pair.
New_Balance,5,Super cute and very comfortable. I ordered a 7.5 w after reading reviews about running small.  I probably would’ve been ok with 7.5 m.  Love the cheetah print
New_Balance,5,"Super cute fashion sneaker! It fit perfectly. If you like a little more room in your sneakers order half a size up. They are narrow, which works for me. I rated a one star for working out because I personally did not purchase them to work out in. They also have metal aglets on the end of the laces. Overall, very cute and comfy."
New_Balance,5,"Super cute kicks.  More for every day wear, rather than heavy exercise.  Like all New Balances, I would recommend ordering 1/2 size up from your regular size."
New_Balance,5,Super cute shoes for tootling around. Not really for running or activity.
New_Balance,5,"Super cute shoes! Got for Disney and they wore very well. Im afraid to wear them to run with because they are just to darn cute, but they could get the job done. They slip on and don’t have a tongue which made it Disney ideal, slide them on and go!
Colors are bright, shoe has held up well"
New_Balance,5,"Super cute! I have a tough time finding wide width sneakers that are cute - I’m 27 and most of the “in style” brands don’t cater to me and my wide footed friends. These are super comfortable, lightweight, and fit perfect in width (size wide). I am usually a 7W or a 7.5W. I ordered 7.5W and they fit my feet like a glove. If you are thinking you’ll wear thick socks with them, go up at least 1/2 a size for the extra room."
New_Balance,5,Super cute! Love the look. Love the color. True to size! So cute and comfortable. Love the material!
New_Balance,5,"Super cute, comfy and perfect fit. Great for working out or just every day life. Oh and the price was amazing too!"
New_Balance,5,Super enjoy just being able to pull the shoe on without adjusting anything! Very comfortable! Breaking them in has given me blisters on my heels but still love these shoes.
New_Balance,5,Super light and comfortable
New_Balance,5,Super light and easy to slip on.  Breathes easily. The bottom keeps coming out though.
New_Balance,5,Super light comfy shoes that are not intended for serious workouts.
New_Balance,5,Super light shoes that are perfect for low impact circuit training. I wouldn’t feel supported for running in these shoes.
New_Balance,5,Super light weight and comfortable. I can wear either an 8 or 8 1/2 depending on the shoe. So glad I got the 8 1/2 in these. The 8 would’ve been too small. They also look great with my scrubs or leggings.
New_Balance,5,Super light weight and easy to slip on because of the attached tongue. Love!
New_Balance,5,Super light weight and wonderful for walking around. I’m not sure I would use these for heavy exercise but they’re great for casual walks.
New_Balance,5,Super lightweight and comfortable!  Great purchased and New Balance is my favorite now!  Recommended!
New_Balance,5,Super lightweight and comfortable. Durable. Easy to clean. My favorite shoes!
New_Balance,5,Super lightweight and feels great on. True size. Great price.
New_Balance,5,Super lightweight and very comfortable. I generally wear a 9 and ordered a 9 1/2 which fits great.
New_Balance,5,"Super stretchy fabric but nice snug fit. They have a faux tongue that's sewn to look like there is one, but it's actually just part of the body of the shoe itself. Great arch support and they go with everything!"
New_Balance,5,"Super super comfortable. The insole is made
of memory foam. There isn’t a ton of arch support but shoe is super comfy"
New_Balance,5,"Super support, super comfy, easy to get on.  Knee replacement surgery made getting shoes on a challenge.  Found these perfect.  I would buy them again and again."
New_Balance,5,Thank you
New_Balance,5,Thank you. Its very beautefule
New_Balance,5,Thanks
New_Balance,5,Thanks
New_Balance,5,The are just perfect. Love them

New_Balance,5,"The BEST shoes ever! Had to buy a second pair because I love them that much. Definitely for those who dislike wearing socks, they fit like a glove."
New_Balance,5,The best waking shoe I have ever bought! They are light yet very supportive and comfortable. I wear mine all of the time. Definitely will buy again!
New_Balance,5,The blacked out look is amazing! Love these shoes!!
New_Balance,5,The color is nice and neutral. They are very lightweight and comfortable.
New_Balance,5,The comfort and style are nice.
New_Balance,5,The comfort I love the way it looks
New_Balance,5,The comfort is great but if you’re on feet all day (roughly over 10k steps a day) this shoe isn’t it. If you want comfortable shoes for a day of leisure this is for you.
New_Balance,5,The comfort level is awesome and they look great. I feel like I have improved my workouts tremendously just by switching to these shoes. They are lightweight and comfortable. They hold up during high-intensity cardio and weightlifting type workouts. I have also gotten so many comments on how cute they are!! This is a must have!
New_Balance,5,The delivery details state order is late. I have received these shoes and they are great.
New_Balance,5,"The fabric on these shoes helps them to conform to your foot.  I have wide feet and this is the first pair of New Balance shoes I have ever owned.  Love the fit and color.  Thinking of ordering a few more pair because once I find a pair that fits, I usually can't find another pair for years."
New_Balance,5,The fit is perfect
New_Balance,5,The fit is very good and shoe is comfortable.  Iam very happy with my purchase.
New_Balance,5,The fit was nice for my wide feet. Not a lot of cushioning but there was plenty of room for my insole.
New_Balance,5,The lightness and fit. They came in very handy during a recent road trip that involved a lot of walking.
New_Balance,5,The most comfortable casual sneaker I’ve ever purchased.  Got my sister hooked on them too!
New_Balance,5,"The most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned. I’ve purchased pairs of shoes that cost double or triple of its price, but they never fit perfectly like this one! It may depend on each person, but this person is very happy with her purchase <3"
New_Balance,5,The most comfortable pair of tennis shoes I have owned. Runs a little bit small. But still love them.
New_Balance,5,The most comfortable pair of tennis shoes I’ve ever worn.  Will get another color.
New_Balance,5,"The most comfortable shoe ever!! Light weight. Laces stay tied, no double knots necessary."
New_Balance,5,THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOE EVER....WILL BE PURCHASING ANOTHER PAIR FOR THE 4TH TIME.
New_Balance,5,the most comfortable shoe I have purchased in the last year.  Perfect fit.
New_Balance,5,The most comfortable shoe I’ve ever owned! Buying another pair. Maybe 2 :)
New_Balance,5,"The most comfortable shoes ever. I wear these as slippers. They’re still super cute, too. They don’t have a ton of support but that can be a good thing."
New_Balance,5,"The most comfortable shoes I have ever owned! I wore these on our 5 day trip to Disney World. I had no complaints of foot pain.
I plan on buying then in more colors!"
New_Balance,5,"The most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased!

The color and style come exactly as pictured and I will never go back to buying tennis shoes with a loose tongue.

New_Balance,5,The navy and teal are really cute together. I have these same shoes in another color and they’re so comfortable that I bought this pair too.
New_Balance,5,"The Nergize V1 shoe is the only tennis shoe I have ever worn that I didn't have to break in for comfort first. I have this pair and the all black pair and they have both been extremely comfortable since day 1. I have worn them almost every day since I purchased them and even washed each pair once and they are still in pristine condition! I love the flexibility and the memory foam soles. I also love that they come in Wide sizes. I don't know if they are comfortable for working out or running, as I do not do either, but I will tell you that I have bad ankles and high arches and I haven't noticed a lack of support. They are by far my favorite shoes!!"
New_Balance,5,The only shoes I use for exercising. Comfortable. Cute and flexible
New_Balance,5,The perfect everyday shoe!!

New_Balance,5,"The reviews helped me to choose a fit for myself, however, I did have to send back the 81/2 and get a 9 W.  I went up a 1/2 size originally.  I also opted for a wide.  They are so comfortable to walk in fir long daily walks."
New_Balance,5,"The shoe fits as it should, true to size. It is so light weight. I feel like I am not even wearing any shoes."
New_Balance,5,"The shoe is comfortable, has good support, lightweight, and is very fashionable. Just what I wanted! I normally wear an 8 1/2 and that is what I ordered. It fit fine."
New_Balance,5,"The shoe is really pretty and very, very comfortable. I brought a wide width and my toes nor feet are uncomfortable. I can walk long distance and not hurt. I love this shoe and I am glad I made this purchase."
New_Balance,5,"The shoe is snug, which I didn't expect it to be; I ordered a wide. However, it is very comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"the shoe is very comfortable light and feels great on my feet, and i work on a marble floor all day"

New_Balance,5,The shoes are a great fit and extremely comfortable when I am doing my workouts.
New_Balance,5,The shoes are better than I expected. Very comfortable. Highly recommend. True to size.

New_Balance,5,"The shoes are great. Light weight and comfy for all day wear. I work in a dental office so being on my feet 75% of the time is not an issue with these shoes. The color I got was Black, Grey, and the grey and aqua. All look great. Just need to find socks short enough to be no show."
New_Balance,5,"The shoes arrived  on the they said it would. Also the shoes are so comfortable  and fits very good
I would recommend  to anyone."

New_Balance,5,"The sole is soft and comfortable; it does not hurt my back or my legs after being in it for over 5 hrs. The material is not that of an excellent quality seemed a bit inferior at first glance, but I guess the material used is to keep the feet nice and warm "" so to speak."" It does look good on my narrow feet ( I am a size 7). I had actually bought this to go trekking with, but it was way too comfortable and did not have sufficient grip for that purpose, so I would just run in them instead."
New_Balance,5,The sole support is cushioned and these sneakers are the most comfortable I’ve ever worn. I’ll buy another pair soon!
New_Balance,5,The tag on the shoes says “I’m so comfortable”. I tried them on and it’s true! The shoes don’t lie! So glad I got my exact right size on the first try for once too!
New_Balance,5,The toe box is made for wider feet and better for the long-term alignment of your toes. These are so comfortable to wear.
New_Balance,5,The toe shape causes the sneaker to run short.
New_Balance,5,The V1 Cross Trainer fit great. It is light weight and has a great cushion built in. Love the V1.
New_Balance,5,The way they fit
New_Balance,5,the wide width was perfect
New_Balance,5,The width is perfect. Very comfortable shoe.
New_Balance,5,Thee are the most comfortable sneakers I own. I walked 3 miles in them my first wear and they didn't need a break in period. I will be buying more.
New_Balance,5,"There are tired feet and there are Disney tired feet. When you know you are going to be walking 20,000 steps a day you want comfort.  These deliver without forsaking style at an awesome price far below original retail price.  Loved them so much I bought a second pair for my Disney loving friend."
New_Balance,5,There cute and comfy😎
New_Balance,5,There’s a tag on the shoe that notes how comfortable they are. That’s an understatement! It’s like walking on a pillow! Love them! They are snug so I’d recommend going up a half size if you want to wear normal socks; they fit fine with the thin no show socks.
New_Balance,5,"These are a good fit. I’m a cleaner and I need something comfortable. They fit well, and my feet don’t ache as much at the end of the day. Highly recommend if you’re on your feet a lot."
New_Balance,5,These are absolutely perfect. They fit great and feel good.
New_Balance,5,"These are amazing shoes for the money. Good support, comfort, looks. My second pair and I love them."
New_Balance,5,"These are AMAZING! I previously had ASICS and Nike...they don't even come close to comparison! I have high arches which always are hard to buy for, and these have amazing support!'"
New_Balance,5,"These are amazing! They are super light weight and the soles are to die for!!!! By far the best shoes I’ve purchased and for less than $50!!! These are amazing and I will be buying another pair! I’m on my feet all day and these are sure to make that a lot better! Good on my back and knees after all day wear, love them!"
New_Balance,5,"These are amazing, I work 8+ hours on my feet and these shoes save me. My back doesn’t hurt any more and the price is extremely reasonable considering I was looking at getting a pair of shoes for over $100 before I found these."
New_Balance,5,These are amazing. Highly recommend. I needed shoes that would fit my afo brace. And these fit like a glove! Super comfortable. I feel like I'm not wearing anything.
New_Balance,5,These are amazingly comfortable especially on my problem feet. This plantar fasciitis sufferer loves these shoes.
New_Balance,5,"These are by far my favorite casual shoes/walking the dog / grocery shopping / all around shoe. I have also used them at the gym but i don’t think they have enough
Support for high intensity workouts . The color is great with anything and I have gotten lots of favorable comments I highly recommend them ..... I don’t have wide feet but they are close to it and these are so comfortable"
New_Balance,5,These are by far one of the most comfortable shows I’ve ever bought. First new balances and the memory foam soles are amazing!!! They are light and stylish. Perfect fit for me especially with wide feet.
New_Balance,5,These are by far the best tennis shoes I’ve had. Very comfortable! Worth the price.
New_Balance,5,These are by far the most comfortable casual sneakers I own. Light weight. I’ve even worn them at work on my feel all day and they were a dream.
New_Balance,5,"These are by far the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever tried on. My feet are wide, and because of nerve damage, my left foot swells off and on. These were at my door when I arrived home from a long day at the state fair, and my feet were feeling rough after walking for hours. Tried these on and had immediate relief. They are easy to slip on, are lightweight and look great!

Side note - I read a lot of reviews before I ordered, and I’m glad I did for sizing purposes. I usually wear an 8.5 Wide, or 9 in normal width. I ended up ordering a 9.5 Wide — the largest size I’ve ever tried, and they fit perfectly length and width wise."
New_Balance,5,"These are comfortable and light weight. I can get through a day of walking and my high arched feet feel good, despite having only moderate arch support. I may eventually put inserts in but I’ve worn them about 10 times and so far so good. They are also nice looking, I’ve gotten compliments on the way they look, very clean and simple."
New_Balance,5,These are comfy shoes for walking around all day.  They are not supportive and I wouldn't suggest using them as a running shoe.
New_Balance,5,These are cute and comfortable right out of the box. I have a wide foot so I ordered a 9 wide and they seem to be true to size. They set low to the ground so if that bothers you that might be a concern. Otherwise I love them.  Can't wait to wear them in the park
New_Balance,5,"These are cute and comfy! They have some support, but I have super high arches, so I put my own arch supports in them. Great fashion sneaker. I probably wouldn’t exercise in them because of the soft top"
New_Balance,5,These are cute for casual days.  I get a lot of compliments on these.  If you need a running shoe I would look for something else.
New_Balance,5,"These are cute, lightweight and super comfy!"
New_Balance,5,"These are cute, stylish, and very comfortable. I've received lots of compliments while wearing these also."
New_Balance,5,These are exactly what I was looking for and I love that they are slip on
New_Balance,5,These are extremely light weight and extremely comfortable. I live these more then my nikes. I’m glad I purchased them. They fit true to size for me.
New_Balance,5,"These are extremely stylish, lightweight, comfortable, and functional. They were a bit tight so I returned to get a bigger size. I’d recommend to size up a half size."
New_Balance,5,"These are fabulous shoes. I happened to buy them right before spending 4 days at a theme park, and they were the BEST shoe choice! Everyone else was whining about their feet the day before I noticed anything. The fit is great, and they look so much better than I thought they would. It's a simple, clean design, and I got lots of compliments."
New_Balance,5,"These are good shoes, fit well, have enough support and they brought compliments from a friend.  Worth the price and purchase."
New_Balance,5,These are great casual sneakers for running around in. I would order a half size up. Really comfortable and so cute.
New_Balance,5,"These are great shoes for running errands.  They look really cute with workout clothes, but they are not designed as a workout shoe.  Very comfortable and lightweight for everyday.  I wear between a 7 1/2 and an 8 with a wider foot, so took a chance and went with the 8 wide based on other customer reviews and they fit perfectly.  The price was great and the shoe is adorable!  The laces do make the shoe a little tighter, however, there is a band of elastic that holds your foot.  So you could basically leave them tied and just slip them on depending on how they fit you.  Very happy with this purchase!"
New_Balance,5,"These are great shoes! I walk almost ten miles a day at work, and have worn these shoes to work in for a year. They have been washed, and worn a ton- and still have tread!"
New_Balance,5,These are great shoes! Super comfy!
New_Balance,5,These are great shoes!! They have a memory foam footbed that is incredibly confortable and they are so lightweight on your feet! I can't believe I didn't buy a pair of these sooner! I am definitely going to have to get a couple more pairs. :)
New_Balance,5,These are great shoes.  I wore them around Vegas for a few days and they were great for the endless miles of walking and site seeing.  I also really like them for the treadmill!  Great shoes.
New_Balance,5,"These are great sneakers but the arch support wasn't quite high enough for me, as I have plantar fasciitis. I just added additional support and now these are perfect. They were a great value and comfort"
New_Balance,5,These are great walking shoes!
New_Balance,5,"These are great walking shoes. I would suggest ordering a half size up, as I found my typical size little snug for my daily walks to and from the train. I’ve ordered three differ t styles now."
New_Balance,5,"These are great! Fit as expected, comfy, & cute with basically every outfit. I will defiantly be buying these again!"
New_Balance,5,"These are great, super comfortable lightweight walking shoes! I've started walking a couple miles to work and back and they are perfect for that. The black ones don't look like tennis shoes too terribly much with a fall and winter outfit."
New_Balance,5,"These are great, very comfortable, good arch support...I almost don't want to wear any other shoe :D"
New_Balance,5,"These are great. Ordered the 8.5 W. Zero rubbing or toe pinching!
I typically wear an 8-8W in other shoes but New Balance is always a tad short"
New_Balance,5,These are hands down some of the most comfortable athletic shoes I’ve ever had. On to my third pair and debating which color I just have to have next! I get so many compliments on them too! Fit is true to size.
New_Balance,5,"These are hands down the most comfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet. I had a pair of Nike's that were very similar. They had been worn out completely and I couldn't find anything comparable for the last year until I stumbled upon these gems. I just received them tonight and put them on immediately! Wow !!!!! My dogs are getting extra walk time with these puppies on my feet.

Ladies, these are not only comfy clouds to hold your feet but they are beautiful shoes! Laces have a slight sparkle to them and the sheen is quite stunning."
New_Balance,5,These are just like the picture. Has memory foam bottoms and breathable mesh. I can slip it on easily without having to tie them again (i know so lazy). They're nice for my work and good for stretching.
New_Balance,5,"These are just one of the most comfortable sneakers I’ve purchased in some time..
Very light weight and just a great pair of sneakers!  I walk about 5 miles a day and they’re just perfect for the trip!"
New_Balance,5,"These are just the height of softness and comfort.  I'll never run in them, but I do enjoy them every day, and for long hours.  The best!"
New_Balance,5,"These are light as a feather and comfortable! I usually wear a size 8 and can wear a medium width in most shoes, but prefer wide as I find them more comfortable. I read the reviews and saw a lot of people saying to size up a half size. So I ordered mine in an 81/2 wide and they fit perfectly! Glad I read the reviews!"
New_Balance,5,These are light comfy sneakers that you can slip on. I wear them as my day shoe with jeans and leggings. I have also worked out in them and they're not bad for that either. Try to keep them out of water.
New_Balance,5,These are light weight and comfy. After a slight mix up I got the right size sent and I'm enjoying them.
New_Balance,5,"These are light weight and very comfortable with just enough support for everyday use.  Not an athletic shoe, but a great everyday shoe."
New_Balance,5,"These are light--so light I thought I'd hate them, but I was wrong.  The insole memory foam is super comfy and you forget you're wearing anything on your feet.  Bought for light hiking but think I'll wear them more."
New_Balance,5,These are like slippers. Ultra comfy for my wide feet. I usually wear a half a size smaller but as soon as I got the larger size my feet were in heaven!
New_Balance,5,These are literally the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. They are the perfect amount of support and cushion. It feels like I’m walking on a pillow. And they are so lightweight that it hardly feels like you’re wearing shoes at all. If I could give more then 5 stars I would.
New_Balance,5,"These are my absolute favorite athletic shoe. As an athletic woman with wide feet and high arches, it can be nearly impossible to find shoes that are comfortable. These feel like clouds on my feet. On my 3rd pair and will be ordering more colors as the wide widths come back in stock."
New_Balance,5,These are my absolute favorite shoes. They are light and cute! I highly recommend them! I got two different colors they were on sale too so it was a great purchase!
New_Balance,5,These are my favorite go to shoes for walking/sightseeing.  You need more support for running but for normal every day activity these can’t be beat!
New_Balance,5,"These are my favorite NB shoes ever.
They fit well and are so stinking cute."
New_Balance,5,These are my favorite shoes . I walk 5 plus miles a day for work . This is my 3rd or 4 th pair .
New_Balance,5,These are my favorite shoes ever!! I am buying as many pair as possible!!
New_Balance,5,"These are my favorite shoes, I’m on my second pair and they are super comfortable and versatile b/c they’re black. I can also slip them on with out have to untie which is a plus. Highly recommend these."
New_Balance,5,"These are my favorite tennis shoes, they hold up well for me and my feet are not tired and sore at the end of the day. I am a nurse, so this is a major plus. They also wash well, another major plus."
New_Balance,5,These are my go to for the gym & for work.  They're the best lightweight sneaker.
New_Balance,5,"These are my go to shoes. I normally wear a 6.5 but sized up to a 7 and the fit is perfect.

I got every color offered in these shoes. I use to be a Sacony loyalist but since these new balances I’ve made the switch.

They are light weight and feel like soft clouds. I use to wear insert in my shoes and now I don’t need them. My feet don’t get fatigued or hurt after a full day in these."
New_Balance,5,These are my go to sneakers. I have bought 3 pairs. The are my favs. My super trendy friend even bought a pair after she saw me rocking these comfortable beasts on my feet.
New_Balance,5,These are my new favorite shoes! I have VERY wide feet and these shoes fit amazingly! Highly recommend.
New_Balance,5,These are my second pair of this shoe and I love them! I am on my feet a lot at work and these are great for that. I found that there is no breaking in period with these and that is fantastic! I pulled them out of the box yesterday and wore them to the grocery store and gym. My feet didn't hurt at all! These are by far my favorite shoes I've had in a long time.
New_Balance,5,"These are my second pair, they are easy to get on and off and great for short periods of times. They do not stand up to an 8 hour day of being on your feel."
New_Balance,5,These are my work shoes and I do a lot of walking and my feet feels fine
New_Balance,5,These are nice sneakers
New_Balance,5,These are perfect and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve been looking for a sporty all black shoe. I tied up the laces and hid them under the elastic band. I’m a size 9 so I bought a 9 and it fits perfect
New_Balance,5,these are perfect shoes!! they are so comfortable and so light!
New_Balance,5,"These are perfect walking shoes for people with planters Fasciitis. Unlike most shoes these are sooo comfortable right off the bat. Probably not recommended for “work” shoes though.
Overall very satisfied with comfort and price!"
New_Balance,5,These are probably the most comfortable shoes on the first wear!
New_Balance,5,These are probably the most comfortable tennis shoes I have ever had on my feet!
New_Balance,5,These are probably the MOST comfortable training show EVER. I seriously want them in every color. They do run half a size to a full size up so be mindful of that but I promise you will LOVE them!
New_Balance,5,These are really cute and comfortable. I love them!
New_Balance,5,"These are ridiculously comfortable to wear! Great for going to the gym or running errands, and they look very stylish :P I have narrow feet and always seem to land on New Balance shoes because they almost always fit me right. These are no exception. I’m a size 10 and the size 10 fits true to size."
New_Balance,5,"These are seriously some very comfortable workout shoes, or just walking shoes! Very light weight, but sturdy. I highly recommend them! I usually wear around a 7 1/2 to an 8 size, but when i found these and tried them on an 8 1/2 actually fits perfectly, so if you have the opportunity to try some on before hand to see what fits you better, i'd do that before buying online :)"
New_Balance,5,"These are so comfortable and hug your foot like a slipper.  Super light weight, it doesn't even feel like I have a shoe on.  Way to go New Balance in designing a shoe that is so comfy to wear with the versatility of a sneaker."
New_Balance,5,These are so comfortable and light weight. I ordered a wide and I’m glad I did. I think they run narrow. I would probably go up a half size next time since I do have wide feet. Overall very pleased.
New_Balance,5,These are so comfortable and light.  Not for running because not the best arch support.  But great for walking and doing errands throughout the day. Soft cushion inside.  They weight almost nothing. I love how they feel.
New_Balance,5,These are so comfortable and so cute! I would definitely recommend these shoes
New_Balance,5,"These are so comfortable and super light weight. Finding decent wide width gym shoes has always been a challenge. I usually end up but hating them after a few weeks. These stand up great to high intensity workouts and walking around all day in the city and at the zoo. I was a little worried about the fit because of other reviews, but followed the size guides and they fit perfectly, also no problems with the heels."
New_Balance,5,"These are SO comfortable and very cute. I can wear them with sporty outfits or even with jeans and a cute tee. I wouldn't wear them for running or serious workouts, as I like something with a little more structure to hold onto my feet. These are stretchy and great every day or walking shoes. I leave them tied and just slip them on and off, which is great since I am pregnant and getting to the point that bending over to tie shoes isn't fun! I would definitely recommend these."
New_Balance,5,"These are so comfortable and very light. I usually have to try shoes on before I purchase them, but I took a risk and these fit perfectly!"
New_Balance,5,These are so comfortable I can wear them walking around all day without my feet hurting. They are lightweight and very cute-I get compliments on them all the time. I think they fit true to size I wear an 8 or 8.5 and I got these in an 8.5 and they fit perfectly.
New_Balance,5,These are so comfortable!
New_Balance,5,These are so comfortable! Definitely just walking shoes - I wouldn’t work out/run in them but they’re seriously the most comfortable everyday  sneakers I’ve owned.
New_Balance,5,These are so comfortable! Fits TTS. Highly recommend!
New_Balance,5,These are so comfortable! They are light and fit perfect.
New_Balance,5,These are so comfortable!!
New_Balance,5,These are so comfy!! love the cushioning
New_Balance,5,"These are so comfy, with or without socks. Great summer walking shoe! Bought them for vacation in Vegas. Walked several miles each day and they were great!"
New_Balance,5,"These are so comfy. I have heel troubles, from rubbing on the back of my heel to hurting the bottom. These are light weight and support my heel beautifully. They are also pretty durable because I have washed them 4 times (I’ve been doing yard work in them) and the outside looks brand new. The insoles didn’t like being washed that much, by the 4th time, I had to replace them."
New_Balance,5,These are so comfy. I wore them out dancing to a reggaeton party (lmao seriously tho ahha) and they didnt hurt my feet at all! I got them in black and they go with everything. Im very happy with my purchase.
New_Balance,5,These are so comfy. Love them. Not much of arch support but only wear to and from work or out and about
New_Balance,5,"These are so light and comfortable, I am very happy with them."
New_Balance,5,These are so light weight and perfect for Zumba and other movement classes that I take at the YMCA. I would recommend them.
New_Balance,5,These are so light!!! They clean easily and are great for running and lifting
New_Balance,5,"These are so, so comfortable. I was looking for something I could exercise in and wear in place of shoes when I needed more comfort. These are light, comfy and not to ""sneakery"" looking. I wear a size 6 shoe and got these in a 6.5 and they are perfect on me. Highly recommend."
New_Balance,5,"These are some of my favorite tennis shoes. I have them in multiple colors, however they do run a bit small for me, so I have to size up 1/2 size. Comfortable all day on my feet in a busy medical practice, but cute enough to wear with jeans on the weekend"
New_Balance,5,These are sooo comfortable. Love that new balance is American made too. I would put these right up in the same range as my ultra boosts.  But the price is way better. I seriously wear them almost daily to work because they are so comfy.
New_Balance,5,"These are soooooo comfortable, I took them to the gym and when I was on the treadmill I felt like I was running on air. They're great for running and walking. They fit comfortably snug so if you know your size and prefer to wear socks you should order half a size up for the best comfort."
New_Balance,5,These are such comfortable shoes!! I plan on ordering another pair. They are perfect for walking and as I have back and feet problems I need.a shoe that feels good. I would recommend them to anyone.
New_Balance,5,"These are super comfortable and fit great. I use them as gym shoes.

I got a 10.5. I’m not an 11 nor a 10, and finding 10.5s is way harder then one would think. So I took a chance with them when I found these. It was worth it."
New_Balance,5,These are super comfortable and lightweight.  Just as pictured.  I'm very pleased!
New_Balance,5,These are super comfortable and very sleek looking. No complaints at all. I ordered a half size up from my normal size but I always have to in new balance. They fit perfect!
New_Balance,5,These are super comfortable. I have scars from surgery on my foot and shows with seams that hit the scars are very painful. These are absolutely perfect right out of the box.
New_Balance,5,These are super comfy and cute for every day living. Wouldn’t use them for running - they don’t really offer any sort of support or sturdiness for that. But I love wearing them on my Target runs!
New_Balance,5,These are super comfy sneakers and I wore them to gym first day and they were great ... they have a very sturdy heel !
New_Balance,5,"These are super comfy.  It's like walking on carpet, you can feel the ground beneath your feet, but it's cushioned and lovely.  It goes a bit high at the back of my foot. Order a half size up."
New_Balance,5,These are super cute to run around town in or go for a walk around the block. I personally wound workout in these because there isn’t much support.
New_Balance,5,These are super light weight and very comfortable!  Highly recommended!
New_Balance,5,These are super light weight and very comfortable! It also helps that they look cute.
New_Balance,5,These are super lightweight and very comfortable. I am a size 7 but ordered 7.5 and the fit is perfect.
New_Balance,5,"These are super sleek and cute, very comfortable, fit well. 10/10 would recommend"
New_Balance,5,"These are swell! I just put these on, so this is based off of my first impression, but so far they’re great! I really dig the construction. They’re not like your typical tennis shoe. Instead of having a separate tongue, it’s one continuous piece. It’s unique and I like that. I ordered the conch shell color and I must say the picture is deceiving. I wasn’t expecting them to be so pink. They’re still cute and I don’t mind it terribly, but I do wish they were a little more on the beige side, like the picture shows. (Oddly, when they ship, the picture you see in the notification is more true to the color. At least I had heads up.) Also, they fit just the teensy bit snug. I am typically a 7 1/2, but because both my husband and oldest son wear New Balance and we had to size up and out (wide) for each of them, I sized up to an 8. I could have even gone for an 8 1/2, but the 8 will do fine. These are my only two “complaints” with these shoes. I have a slightly high arch and I can feel the footbed underneath them even when I’m not putting pressure on them (sitting vs. standing), so I’m confident in the support they’ll provide. I don’t run or work out; I’m just a mom of little ones and legitimately comfortable, “healthy” shoes are important to me. These fit the bill wonderfully."
New_Balance,5,These are the absolute best and most adorable shoes to walk around Disney in! I got so many compliments on them and they are so comfortable. They are so light and let your feet breathe. I definitely recommend them!
New_Balance,5,"These are the best fitting shoes I've ever had. They are super comfortable.  I have a wide foot and in other shoes I always feel like my pinky toes are squished,  even in wide widths, but not with these shoes. And they look great!"
New_Balance,5,These are the best pair of shoes I own. They are some comfortable that I put them on straight out of the box and wore them all day. These are perfect for long walks. They are so comfy it almost feels like I am walking around in my favorite house slippers all day.
New_Balance,5,These are the best shoes EVER!!!
New_Balance,5,These are the best shoes I have ever had!!!
New_Balance,5,"These are the best shoes I have ever ordered! I have really wide flat feet, so finding a shoe that allows my foot to have room and has support can be a big challenge. This shoe is very flexible, extremely comfy, and very light. Perfect for training in!"
New_Balance,5,"These are the best sneakers I’ve ever owned. I bought a pair on sale at a sporting goods store around Christmas and ended up loving them so much that I bought a second pair on amazon. They’re supportive, lightweight and so darn comfortable. They have an attached tongue so if that bothers you these may not be the shoes for you, but I actually prefer it now. If they were less expensive I’d seriously own them in just about every color."
New_Balance,5,These are the best trainers I've had in a long time. They've been great for running and lifting weights at the gym as well as just walking around the neighborhood.
New_Balance,5,These are the best.  I wanted a sneaker I could just slip on and these are perfect.  Good arch support and very light weight.  I put them on in the morning and don’t take them off until bedtime.  So comfortable.
New_Balance,5,These are the by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. They are actually side on & laces are used to tighten them. Mood altering comfort!
New_Balance,5,These are the comfiest shoes I’ve ever owned!!! Perfect for people who work on their feet all day!
New_Balance,5,These are the lightest sneakers I have ever wore.  Very comfortable for walking.
New_Balance,5,"These are the lightest, most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever owned. I adore all things Disney and they are adorable. I did go a full size up as they run a bit small."
New_Balance,5,These are the most amazing shoes! I have never owned a more comfortable pair of sneakers! It's like being barefoot or socks at the most. Obviously they're very cute too. Might be fun for a Disney trip. Performance wise I wouldn't recommend for HIIT b/c the grip on the sole is minimal. They are more suited as casual every day shoes.
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable and affordable shoes! I love how light weight and cushy they are!
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable and best looking walking shoes I’ve ever had! We
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable and lightweight shoes I have ever purchased and worn.
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable pair of sneakers I own , I wore them to the gym today and It felt like walking on a cloud.  I just ordered my second pair ! I'm normally a size 8 and ordered a 7.5 they fit excellent"

New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable shoes and they are so cute!! I need a pair in each color! Haha
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes ever! I am pregnant and not able to fit in my regular work shoes, or any shoes. I got these and I wear them almost every day. Super comfortable and great support. They are also supper light and breathable, perfect for warmer days. I don't think I will wear them in cold weather because it wont keep your feet warm."
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes ever. I use them for cross training and love them. I have two colors and want to buy the rest. I wouldn’t personally wear them for running as the sides are very soft and I like a more structured shoe but for leisure, lifting, walking, and basically everything else they’re my go to."
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned!! They are so light and amazing!!!! I LOVE THEM!!
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. So glad I bought these. Wide enough, good cushy support and so lightweight! I walk 10miles a day for my job and these are perfect!"
New_Balance,5,"These are THE MOST COMFORTABLE shoes I have EVER put on my feet. I’m literally just sitting around my house wearing them after I tried them on. They feel amazing and fit perfectly I usually wear 8.5, I saw that you needed to size up half a size in the reviews and I did, and they feel great.
I will update how they hold up. But right now I’m just so excited because they’re beautiful AND comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn! I’m beyond impressed at the comfort level of these throughout an entire 10-12 hour work day of standing, walking and hustling through the halls of a busy doctors office. These are by far the best shoes I’ve ever found. Already planning on buying more just to make sure I always have them."
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I have them in three colors and somehow have to talk myself out of wearing them every day to work. I have always been drawn more to Nike but due to back and feet issues comfort is now most important. These shoes look great and are super comfortable. Highly recommend!
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes I may have ever worn. The sole feels a little stiff when you first put them on but once you stand up you sink into this like, memory foam type material and they are amazing"
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable shoes I own now. They are very nice and they are exactly like pictured. I seriously love them!
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned, however they run a bit small. I normally wear a 9 but had to send those back for a 9.5."
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever put on. Love them! I needed something for walking on the treadmill and cycling. After reading the reviews I when up a 1/2 a size, from a size 7 1/2 to an 8. Fit me perfectly! Will definitely order another pair in a different color."
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable shoes I’ve had in a while. I bought a pair of Brooks but I like these better. They feel good on your feet.

New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes. I have them in 3 shades, but the pink are my favorite. They aren’t super supportive, but my feet felt great after walking 7 straight days at Disney."
New_Balance,5,THESE ARE THE MOST COMFORTABLE SNEAKERS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED! BEST SHOES EVER! I will be buying these in every color!
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable sneakers I have found in years. I have a wide foot and flat arch and I tend to walk on my toes a lot. So sneakers are hard for me to wear for long without getting sore feet, and these are great I wore them around the house first day for a couple hours and no blisters or anything, I actually felt supported and comfortable. I love them, so glad they come in wide!"
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable sneakers/trainers ever.  I bought my first pair a few months ago.  Have been wearing them for exercising.  I bought two more pairs because they are so comfortable just walking and running around.  I cannot stress how comfortable they are.
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable tennis shoes I own.  Had them in my cart for a ehile before I ordered.  I wish I would have ordered earlier.  They are also VERY fashionable.
New_Balance,5,These are the most comfortable tennis shoes I've ever had! And I've had some expensive brands! I like how they're lower in the back than most tennis shoes.
New_Balance,5,"These are the most comfortable, most flattering athletic shoes I've ever owned. I have them in 3 colors! LOVE THEM."
New_Balance,5,"These are the most flexible new balance shoes I've bought yet! If you are looking for a get up and go pair of shoes, look no further. But I would advise that if you wear 1/2 sizes like me, go up one."
New_Balance,5,"These are the perfect light-weight shoes for walking, and maybe running but can't say for sure.  I wear an 81/2 and sometimes a 9.  I got the 81/2 and they fit perfectly.  I purchased the gray and feel like they will go with spring and summer clothes.  I would definitely purchase them again."
New_Balance,5,These are the perfect neutral sneaker. I love how sleek they are. I’m on my feet all day and have never had issues with them being uncomfortable. I would absolutely recommend these.
New_Balance,5,These are the shoes I reach for when I want to be comfortable and stylish. Have to remind myself to take them off! People notice and ask about them too.
New_Balance,5,These are true to size and the width is perfect for my fat feet without having to buy wide. These are good day shoes but have little to no arch support.
New_Balance,5,"These are truly the best sneakers I've ever bought. I ordered them on a Sunday, got them on a Tuesday, didn't have time to break them in, walked 20+ miles around Disney World on Friday & Saturday and it's like the shoes were made just for me. They are truly SO COMFORTABLE. I can't comment on using them for running or cross-training, but these are by far an amazing shoe for walking and casual wear. I will be buying another pair if/when mine get too worn out. Great casual/neutral color too - they go with everything!"
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable and I'd def buy them again. But next time, I would size up.  I am usually a size 8 and that's what I ordered, but they are pretty snug. I'd get 8.5 or 9 next time!"
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable and lightweight. I am not a runner or jogger so I cannot say as to the value of this shoes for that, but i can say after total knee replacement surgery they let me walk 2 miles the first week and over 5 miles by the 4th week. Exceptional walking shoe!!"
New_Balance,5,These are very comfortable and true to size.
New_Balance,5,These are very comfortable and very light. Love the design.
New_Balance,5,These are very comfortable and with a great style.  Great for everyday wear.  Run a bit large but can be snuggly fit with lacing.  I will buy again.
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable for casual wear, which was my intended purpose when I bought them.  After reading reviews, I decided to order a half size up.  Ordinarily I wear a size 7W (when I can find a wide width), so I ordered these in 7.5W.  The fit is just perfect - my feet aren't cramped, but neither is the shoe too long.

While this shoe has a cushy sole, it does not offer much arch support, nor do the sides hug your feet, so it's probably not a good choice for exercise.  However, if you're just looking for a comfortable shoe you can slip on to go to the store, this one is for you."
New_Balance,5,These are very comfortable for every day use. I’m on my feet all day and I’m in no rush to take them off at the end of the day.
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable right out of the box. They're a perfect fit with no socks on, do if you plan on wearing medium or heavy weight socks, I'd order a half-size up."
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable shoes, and they look good, too."
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable shoes, I just got them to wear to work. I work long hours in a lab, it's mostly sitting with a little walking, so I'm not sure how they would hold up with a lot of walking."
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable shoes. However, I would recommend them more indoor use for someone who should wear hard-soled shoes even in the house at home."
New_Balance,5,These are very comfortable sneakers. Lightweight and cool. Lower cut do the don’t come up high on the back of my foot - I don’t wear sneakers often because most are bulky and high in the back. And they are really stylish. I’ve only worn them once so don’t know if they will hold up well but with Nee Balance reputation I think they probably will.
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable
i just had knee replacement surgery and needed a good sneaker to walk in, this is perfect"
New_Balance,5,These are very comfortable.  They are very lightweight. I have not worked out on them yet so unsure how they do with running or cross training.
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable. I wear an 11 and Ideally there would be an 11.5 but there is not.  I would say perhaps if you like a roomier shoe and a thick sock or want to put in an orthotic go up 1/2 size.  The 11 it’s just a tiny bit small, my toes hit right at the toe box.  But since they are so comfortable I’m leaving them as is —I think they have nice arch support. I plan to use these just for walks."
New_Balance,5,"These are very comfortable. Make sure you get the wide size if you have wider feet. The size 9 was really tight for me, so I returned them and got a 9 wide. They fit great!"
New_Balance,5,These are very comfy.  I've used them in a bodypump exercise class and the wide heel helped stabilize me.
New_Balance,5,"These are very lightweight and I love how they look! After reading reviews, I ordered a half size up and I’m very thankful I did because they fit just right. I also ordered “wide” which I’m thankful for because these seem to be fairly narrow as well. I’m very satisfied!"
New_Balance,5,"These are wonderful. I didn't know about them being slightly slip on. If you are a size 8, you get the most perfect size 8 available.  Almost sized down but changed. Go with shorts, jeans, yoga pants, wear around house, to store, wherever. Perfect shoe. At first they are tight. They feel soooooo good as well."
New_Balance,5,"These are wonderful. Light, fits well and love the material they are made of!"
New_Balance,5,"These arrived two days ago and so far, I love them. I was looking for a lightweight, arch supported , comfortable walking shoe that was also stylish.  These shoes meet all those expectations. I love how cute they are. They aren't bulky like traditional sneakers and look cute with a skort and sweater too.  They do run small. I have small feet, in sneakers I usually go with a kids size 3.5 or 4, (size 5 in dress shoes)but because other reviewers mentioned these ran small, I took a chance. They fit perfect. I ordered the size 5."
New_Balance,5,These feel amazing in and are very lightweight to wear even after all day!
New_Balance,5,"These fit as expected, are SO comfortable, yet still have great support for a circuit workout, or for just walking around/casual. I've already received TONS of compliments on them and you just cannot beat the price. I've only had them a week so I cant say anything about how they'll hold up over time, bu so far I would definitely recommend them and buy again."
New_Balance,5,These fit beautifully. I'm really enjoying the comfort and feel of them.
New_Balance,5,"These fit perfect and have a lot more heel support then I expected. Super light weight and fit like gloves, no rubbing the back of my heels. Would recommend!"
New_Balance,5,These have been some of the most comfortable shoes I've had in a while. I have a wide foot and the width is perfect on this shoes. Would purchase another pair.
New_Balance,5,"These lightweight shoes are so comfortable, easy to get on, and stylish! Great for running errands and working out. New Balance are made in the USA and very affordable."
New_Balance,5,these lil bbs are AMAZING. i got them in all black and they are so chic with EVERYTHING
New_Balance,5,"These look great and are so light and comfortable. The only issue is they aren’t great for narrow feet. When I tightened them up enough to fit my foot, the top part was all wrinkled up and looked pretty weird.  Fit TTS to my other NB"
New_Balance,5,"These may be the best gym shoes I have ever bought.  They are extremely comfortable, stylish, and fit well. I am very pleased."
New_Balance,5,these memory foam super light disney sneakers are amazing!  very comfortable for a lightweight shoe.
New_Balance,5,These might be the most comfortable shoes I have!  They are really light weight and super good.  All around awesome!
New_Balance,5,"These N.B Nergize are Cute, Comfy and in style.  Plenty of room with soft construction, good support."
New_Balance,5,These NB’s are some of my favorites. I do end up putting on my own insole but the one it comes with works. I just wear them so much I needed some extra support.
New_Balance,5,These New Balances are must have :) they are extremely comfortable on the foot and beautiful. I have 5 pairs already. Highly recommend
New_Balance,5,"These new style runs small! Get a whole size bigger. I wear an 8.5 wide, bought and my toe is pushing the toe box out."
New_Balance,5,These rock. I’ve barely taken them off since I put them on. They’re good for exercise and day to day. Very light weight and i usually forget I’m wearing shoes at all. I highly recommend!
New_Balance,5,These run a bit small compared to Arishis. Had to go a half size up
New_Balance,5,These run on the small side but since I have a very narrow foot they work for me.
New_Balance,5,These shoes  are so cute. Feel good too. I love them.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are a dream. I feel like I am walking on a cloud. I have wide feet and ordered a wide - they fit just tight. They are also perfect at work with jeans.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are adorable! Comfortable, light weight and fit as expected. They are great because they are stylish but not too flashy."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are adorable!! I have not attempted an actual run in these shoes, so I have no ide if they are good for that.
I bought them for style and they are perfect and feel nice."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are amazing and perfect for running. Better then my Nike Tanjun
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are amazing if you order them in the right size. Trust me, go a half size up and you will love these shoes! I got my exact size the first time and had to return and order a half size up. Easy process and the replacement pair came the next day, so no complaints! Please just do yourself a favor and order them in a half size up! :-)"
New_Balance,5,These shoes are amazing! First off they look exactly as pictured color wise. I work in radiology at a hospital so I’m on my feet all day walking a lot and these are so comfortable. They have the perfect amount of support and are breathable. The best thing about them are how light they are. They almost feel like nothing is on my feet. I’ve worn them for a week now and they have been perfect. The memory foam inserts are a plus as well. Overall these shoes are great especially if used for long distance walking.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are amazing! I can't believe I found a shoe this comfortable. I have wide feet with no arch so its difficult to find comfortable exercise shoes that are not hundreds of dollars. These shoes are light and have breathable fabric. They are also well made and pretty cute. I'm more than happy with these shoes and would highly recommend them to anyone.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are amazing! I work at a hospital, 12+ hr shifts and these shoes are THE best. So lightweight and comfy. I LOVE these shoes!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are AMAZING! Light weight, breathable, soft step, perfect fit. These shoes wrap my feet in softness. I feel like I'm walking on clouds  due to the memory foam. I haven't noticed any negative things about the shoes so far and I've owned them and have ran with them for a week now."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are amazing! The soles are super cushiony and have the perfect amount of support while still being breathable and flexible. They are super cute too! I think I might have to get them in every color!
New_Balance,5,These shoes are amazing!! I really wanted a pair of all white ones but was unable to find any so settled with the all black. They are incredibly comfy and my favorite shoes ever right now. I am usually a 9.5 but always opt for a size 10 due to my arch swelling. If you are in between sizes at all I would size up-I have less toe room than normal!
New_Balance,5,These shoes are amazing. As soon as I bought my first pair 2 years ago I’ve been addicted forever. Slowing adding to my collection. Typically I wear size 6.5-7 but these shoes I wear 7-7.5. Returning is a pain though because it’s not free and you have to provide your own boxing to ship it back. Has to be returned to a usps location only.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are awesome!  I've only walked in them once but the way they fit I can tell they are going to be great!  I was so glad I could get them in a ""narrow"" size.  Stylish and comfortable!!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are AWESOME! I walked for 13 hours around Universal Studios with my family. Everyone was super sore by the end of the day and I was ready to keep on keeping on. They ROCK for gym workouts as well, and look fabulous with all my workout wear. I would buy these again and keep recommending them to all the members that take my classes at the gym. FIVE STARS NO DOUBT!"
New_Balance,5,These shoes are awesome! I've gotten so many compliments on them. I got them to wear at work and they're perfect. They're super lightweight. They also have fairly decent support for my high arches. I know other reviews suggest sizing up but I ordered my correct size (8.5) and they fit perfect. My only negative thing to say is that you have to wear no show socks with these. My normal ankle socks stick out when I wear them but it's only an issue when I don't wear long pants. Overall I'm very satisfied with these shoes!
New_Balance,5,these shoes are awesome!! i bought 1/2 size up and wide because i have a bunyon on left foot and always difficult for me to find shoes that don't hurt because of it. these shoes are true to size and feels like i'm walking on clouds!!
New_Balance,5,These shoes are awesome. They feel great and look great. They do run a but small so I would suggest getting a half size bigger. Definitely ordering some more colors.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are beyond comfortable! After being at work all day my feet aren't killing me like they were in my other athletic shoes. Definitely buying again and would recommend!
New_Balance,5,These shoes are by far the best tennis shoes I’ve owned and I have 4 other brands with multiple styles in my closet. I was diagnosed with planters fasciitis and was told to buy new shoes. I’ve been wearing these with no insert and my foot has felt 1000x better.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are comfortable and are at a reasonable price.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are comfy AF!  So cute too - just be sure to order a half size up.  LOVE.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are crazy comfortable! And I love the color. I ordered a size 8 at first because I’ve always been a size 8 in sneakers, but they were snug. I almost kept them because they were still comfy despite being snug, but I eventually decided to return for an 8.5 and they are much better. Definitely recommend sizing up a half size!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are cute, comfortable and lightweight.  They aren't extremely sturdy, so I don't imagine they are good for running or even a lot of walking.  But they feel great on my feet and are very cute.  Great leisure shoes.  They do have a lot of arch support which my foot is taking some getting used to, so a little aching the first few wears, but still very comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are dressier than wearing white tennis shoes.  They look good with jeans, they're comfortable, and they are holding up fine so far.  I have a pair of these in navy in the regular width, as well.  I had to jury rig the laces as they were somewhat too narrow.  The wide width solved that problem. They're extremely light in weight, so you can travel easily with them."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are exceedingly comfy.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are extremely lightweight and for that reason, was fearful they would not offer much support. But they actually support me just fine. Because they are so lightweight, they are extremely breathable and didn’t take long to break in. I have only used them with walking/standing so I’m not sure how they’d hold up with daily running or climbing, things of that nature. If you are looking for a good casual but sporty shoe, this one is for you. I will add that at times they look more like dark blue than black but that’s just my perception. My foot is very wide and these offered good stretch to accommodate."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are fabulous! I was going to the Masters golf tournament where there was going to be a LOT of walking! I have bad plantar fasciitis on my right foot and I was a little worried about taking new shoes. From the moment I put these shoes on, they were so comfortable!  I put in my own orthodic and have never looked back! Light weight, supportive and a good looking shoe all rolled into one! Also at a great price!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are great for the price. I am an ER nurse and I walk on these ALL DAY. Highly recommend. The only caveat I would say is that they have very little arch support, which is great for me because I have fairly flat feet, but someone wanting more arch support might be able to get that with some arch support inserts. I get compliments on these all day long!"
New_Balance,5,These shoes are great for walking.  They gave great support for my feet and legs without the high price.  Well worth the purchase.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are great they just slide on they dont even need the laces since its all connected like a slip on. The fit is great and I have wide feet and these aren’t tight or uncomfortable I can wear them all day. I have 2 different pairs one for each of my jobs and even just to run errands they’re perfect
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are great, so light and comfortable. I bought these for my son, he’s 11. Youth boy sizes are women size minus 2, so since he wears a 5.5 in boys I bought a 7.5 women size and they fit perfectly. Less expensive for some reason too"
New_Balance,5,"these shoes are great. bought them to be me Disney Park shoes. they are comfortable and love the slip on design. I love the little Minnie mouse design without being too  overpowering, I can wear these anytime. I bought these in my normal size and they fit great."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are great. I have thick feet (not wide but thick top to bottom) and sometimes have trouble finding shoes to fit.  These are a great fit and super comfortable.would definitely purchase again.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are great. Once I remove the padding, I am able to wear my foot orthotics in them. I hope to be ordering another pair soon."
New_Balance,5,these shoes are great. super cute and match nearly everything.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are light and comfortable.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are lightweight and more supportive than you would think considering the light and thin design. Definitely glad I purchased these, i have received several compliments on them!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are lightweight, easy to put on / take off, provide support, and look great. For the price, you can't beat them."
New_Balance,5,These shoes Are like walking oN air and are so breathable.  Love them!
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are my favorite shoes ever. The shoes will fit a little snug at first but will stretch out after a couple of wears. I love these shoes so much that I ordered two extra pairs afraid that NB will discontinue them in the future and I will not find them ever again, that’s just much I love them."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are nice and comfortable. I used them while I worked at a warehouse for like 10 hours and my feet felt nice and cushioned all through. I used these shoes for about 4 months at the warehouse.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are not only cute, but they are definitely one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought! They are light weight, soft, comfortable and I have gotten compliments on them."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are perfect and beautiful. They fit just right!
New_Balance,5,These shoes are perfect for the price! Super comfortable!! And they are very nice looking! I was very very happy with this purchase!!
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are perfect! Lightweight, so comfortable, I don’t want to take them off! They are true to size."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are perfect! Very comfortable and flattering with any outfit. The sizing runs a bit small so I’d suggest going up a half size. I normally wear an 8.5 in most shoes and a 9 fit me perfectly. Don’t be afraid of the light color these wash up beautifully in the washing machine!
New_Balance,5,These shoes are PERFECT. They are lightweight and so comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are pretty cute and fit the style I was looking for. They are comfy, but I would say the run just a bit on the small side. 7.5 is my usual sneaker size, but these are snug unless I wear them without socks."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are pretty much comfortable out of the box and needed very little breaking in. Exactly what I needed work for being on my feet all day. Only detracting factor is that they're suddenly squeaky in the soles. I don't know if that's just my pair or what, but I can deal with the noise for the comfort."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are really comfortable and great to run in. Very light
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are really comfortable and look pretty good, too. I do have to admit that my husband was surprised that they didn’t fit him very well, though, since he’d ordered his regular 10.5 and they were simply way too small. It wasn’t until he came in to order a larger size that he realized he’d ordered women’s shoes. 🤣 He did go and order the correct shoe in a men’s once he realized his error. Lol! I ended up with a nice pair of shoes though. That said, these shoes fit me perfectly (size 10.5) and I’m usually a solid size 9... so I think they run a bit small. Otherwise, these are great shoes; very light and comfortable."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are really comfortable and stylish. Ordered  a size 9 and they fit perfectly.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are really cute and comfortable, but size up! I usually wear a 5, but my toes were at the very end of the shoes and I had to send them back for a bigger size."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are sleek and comfy and feel great while lifting or in a Zumba class. They make my feet look small and I like’em a lot.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are so adorable! I bought them for my upcoming Disney trip. Per the other reviews, I did order a half size up. I’m normally an 8.5/9 depending on the brand. I went with a 9.5 on these & they fit perfect.  Very comfortable."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are so comfortable ! Love them . They fit perfectly.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are so comfortable & lightweight! I found them to run somewhat small. I’m normally a 7.5 and the 8 fits perfectly!
New_Balance,5,These shoes are SO comfortable and cute! I love them! They’re perfect for my job where I’m on my feet all day.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are so comfortable and lightweight! I love how they feel. The sole is soft but not too squishy, and they feel supportive but not rigid. The new colors are so cute, too!"

She said the same thing as I did...WOW!!

New_Balance,5,These shoes are so light and comfortable... it’s like walking on a cloud! They also are more of a slip on shoe with laces just for show. I bought these shoes for a trip to Hong Kong knowing i’d do tons of walking. Shoes were awesome and I’m so glad I got them.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are so light weight and comfortable! I will be ordering them in another color I love them so much!
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are so nice and lightweight! I generally wear an 8 1/2 and I have wider feet so I got an 8 1/2 wide. They are a bit smaller than perfect size, I could have gotten away with a 9. They are so comfy though, I figure once I break them in they will be perfect anyway! Great quality and almost feels like I am wearing slippers!!!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are so pretty-great for Disney fan. They are so comfortable and good to walk or run in. I ordered an entire size up and they fit perfectly! normally an 8.5 ordered a 9.5. I think a 9 would've probably fit but was sold out and the 8.5 would of been a tad snug. I read New Balances are meant to immediately fit your feet not ""stretch"" like other sneakers."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are so soft and flexible, you forget you are even wearing them. I am a teacher and do a lot of walking a day (10,000 steps or so) and haven't had an issue with these yet. I have also taken them out for walks around my hilly neighborhood and they feel great. My feet are not sore at the end of the day anymore. And they're so cute! 💙💙💙"
New_Balance,5,These shoes are some of the most comfortable that I've ever owned! They are so light weight and easy to slip on! I will be buying more!

New_Balance,5,These shoes are super comfortable. Not sure how they will hold up during exercise yet but so far so good.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are super comfy. I'm on my feet all day long and tried these shoes and my feet don't hurt near as bad. They are so light and breathable too. Already ordered a second pair in a different color.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are super cute light weight I love them.  Had to order one size larger but they fit great.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are super cute, they are comfortable, and they fit me perfectly. I am happy with my purchase."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are super light and comfortable. More like slippers than running/walking shoes. As long as they hold up, I will definitely buy these again. I have wide feet and finding shoes is nearly impossible in stores. The 8.5 wide fit me perfectly and I am so thankful I could cry."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are super light and comfortable. The all black look makes it look sleek, even though it is a little bit wide at the front."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are the best shoes I’ve ever worn!!  Great appearance, arch support, so comfortable for all activities, and so easy to clean!!!"
New_Balance,5,These shoes are the most comfortable sneakers I've ever bought! They are incredibly comfortable. My back didn't hurt after my shift. My feet didn't hurt. They're very durable. I love the memory foam in the middle.

New_Balance,5,"these shoes are very comfortable and light, they fit very well and look good."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are very comfortable and light. A lot of people said they were true to size I found them to be Just a little small. I ordered a half size bigger and my toe is at the very end but I think once I wear them a couple of times it will be OK
New_Balance,5,These shoes are very comfortable and light. I work in the medical field and they are great with scrubs.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are very comfortable and lightweight!

New_Balance,5,These shoes are very comfortable. Very happy with the purchase.
New_Balance,5,These shoes are very good for being on your feet for a while! I would recommend them
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are very light weight and comfortable.  I bought them right before a trip to Japan, where I knew I’d be walking a lot.  They didn’t disappoint.  I don’t think they’d be great for a runner, but walking is definitely fine.  They’re also stylish and not bulky, so they can be worn with a lot."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are very lightweight and comfortable.  Hardly know they are on.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes are way more awesome than I thought they would be! I was buying because they were at an awesome price point ($45), and they looked super cute! They are low cut at the ankle, but they stay still on your foot...no sliding around, which is one of my pet peeves when it comes to training shoes. They are super comfortable as well with the memory foam insole. Do size up by at least a half size. I did follow other reviews on that, and they were perfect. Ordered a 9 and usually wear an 8.5 in everything."
New_Balance,5,These shoes are worth every penny! Great support and very comfortable
New_Balance,5,These shoes came quickly and are the most comfortable shoes I’ve tried yet ... and my feet are old and know what they like!
New_Balance,5,These shoes feel awesome and perfect touch of leopard! Love them!
New_Balance,5,These shoes feel like you're walking on clouds. They are SO comfortable. I would recommend going up a half size from your normal shoe size though. I did based on other recommendations and they fit perfectly.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes fight and felt great right out of the box. Ordering online is always a crap shoot. I got them and wore them to work (10 hrs) they are extremely comfortable light and airy. They look great! Size 9`s can look really big at times. These actually make my feet look smaller. I own so many different shoes, wear different shoes daily and seasonally. These are keeper! Will purchase in other colors."
New_Balance,5,These shoes fit amazing. They have enough support that my feet don’t hurt later.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes fit great.
I often have a problem finding shoes that fit because of how wide my feet are ,however, these were very comfortable and I have problem walking 5 miles without any pain in my feet from being too tight; the memory foam seemed to absorb any shock from the pavement."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes fit great...they’re extremely comfortable
My new fav!"
New_Balance,5,These shoes fit like a glove!
New_Balance,5,"These shoes fit like a glove, except for  the toe box. They are really meant for wide feet  and I'm sure they would be so snug. I tested them, but ended up returning because they were just too loose around the mid toe box and around the heel area."
New_Balance,5,These shoes fit me exactly right. I do think it's best to wear very thin socks or peds...or go sockless. I love the way they look and they provide more support than you would expect from handling them. Very lightweight and easy to pack for a trip.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes fit perfectly! I have narrow feet, so it is difficult to find walking shoes that are not too wide. This shoe is super cute and very lightweight. I am sold. Will most likely buy another pair for when these wear out. It is nice to have a cute walking shoe that fits well and offers support to give my running shoes a break. Would highly recommend these!!!!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes fit perfectly! So light weight, I feel like I have no shoes on. Great looking too!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes fit perfectly, and I was able to wear them all day right from the start. I have fussy feet so this is a huge plus! They are so lightweight and comfortable. I would definitely recommend them."
New_Balance,5,These shoes fit true to size for normal width feet. I really like that the bottom soles are textured so I can wear them outside without slipping.  The shoes are light weight and easy to slip on.  I like that the material is not super thin also. Great shoes!
New_Balance,5,"These shoes fit very well.  They are very comfortable.  My only concern is that the description states they are black, but they are more a charcoal grey."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes fit well, have good support and are light and comfortable."
New_Balance,5,These shoes had a very narrow sole and it felt like my instep was falling off the shoe.  No support at all
New_Balance,5,"These shoes have been a god sent. I am 37 weeks pregnant and these shoes are amazing! My feet have been so swollen and they look bad so to find some shoes that I can slip on and they don’t hurt my feet and still look super cute has been a blessing. I’ve had so many compliments on them and I just love to brag about them and recommend them to anyone who asks about them. They have great stretch, cushy insoles, and they get pretty good ventilation. I don’t wear socks with them because my feet have been so sweaty this pregnancy so they do get stinky but I just throw them in the washer and they’re holding up great. I highly recommend these shoes!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes have the perfect design aesthetically, and they're very comfy! Keep it up New Balance."
New_Balance,5,These shoes helped me so much at work
New_Balance,5,"These shoes imare stylish, breathable and fits perfectly."
New_Balance,5,These shoes look like they tie but they actually slip-on. I have high arches and these have moderate arch supports. They are comfortable to walk long distances. They are also incredibly lightweight. They look great with pants or shorts. Wide variety of color choices.
New_Balance,5,These shoes ran smaller than all Nike and Adidas trainers that I have purchased in the same size. Sadly had to send them back
New_Balance,5,These shoes ran to narrow which was great for me as I have a narrow foot and have a hard time buying shoes that fit well.  These were perfect.  I would advise to buy a half to full size larger than you normally wear.
New_Balance,5,"These shoes saved my a**
I am 7 months pregnant and my feet swell and hurt. I got these half a size large just due to pregnancy and in wide. I cannot explain how happy I am! I wear them at work 7 hours a day and they save me."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes seem to run a tad small. I’m normally between a 7 and 7.5, so I ordered a 7.5. My toes are at the end, but not uncomfortable enough to exchange them.  I should have ordered a 0.5 size larger.  They’re very comfortable for walking around all day (not exercise, just a normal daily routine).  I wish they didn’t have the useless tie laces, but I was able to cross them at the top and tie them underneath my foot.  I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on them!"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes slip right on, no hassle. They have held up well after many flights of stairs at work(my office is on the 3rd floor). They clean well with a wet rag. No complaints!"
New_Balance,5,These shoes were an instant fit! No breaking in and so comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"These shoes were bought on a whim. I needed a new pair, but wasn't sure which brand to look at. I do have wide-feet so I knew I needed to look for that. These shoes are true to fit, comfortable, and look pretty good."
New_Balance,5,"These shoes were exactly what I wanted. As a nurse, I’m on my feet all day. By the time I went home, I hurt so badly I could barely walk. These help give me the comfort I need to make it through my day.  Perfect fit, perfect cushion. HIGHLY recommend"
New_Balance,5,"These shoes were exactly what my sister in law wanted for Christmas. She said they are extremely comfortable and fit great. Right now, she's only had a couple of workouts wearing them, but hasn't had any issues."
New_Balance,5,These shoes were highly recommended by friends and they did not disappoint. The fit is great and I could wear them all day long they are one of the comfiest shoes I’ve purchased.
New_Balance,5,These shoes were just what I was looking for.  They are durable and have lasted me years.  I love that there is no tongue that can slip out of place. I tie them once and slip on day after day.  They are great!
New_Balance,5,"These shoes were perfect for our Disney trip. Of course feet are going to get tired innsome way walking miles a day, but these were very comfortable and very lightweight . These were a good fit and very cute! I wear an 8.5 and purchased a 9 to be safe and they were a good fit."
New_Balance,5,"These shows feel really comfy and light! Very breatheable material and I imagine they would be easy to clean. HOWEVER I'm a size 10, sometimes a 9.5 if my feet don't swell, and a normal size 10 in here made the fitting a bit tight. I'm sure I'll be able to create a smidge of wiggle room after walking in them, but I'd suggest to order half a size up if you can, or do the width option if available. Otherwise they seem like great shoes this far!"
New_Balance,5,These size 8’s we found to be a bit small. Went for an 8.5 instead. Great looking shoe otherwise in black on black.
New_Balance,5,These sneakers are absolutely amazing. It is like having comfortable slippers on your feet all day long. They are lightweight and support feet for long hours a day. Excellent buy!
New_Balance,5,"These sneakers are perfect for the hot weather here in Florida.  They are breathable, and light. I highly  recommend these I also have a pair in white.  If New Balance made them in Blue I would buy them too!"
New_Balance,5,These sneakers are so comfortable.  I plan on getting a second pair!
New_Balance,5,These sneakers are soooo comfortable and great price. Love that I don’t have to tie sneakers just slip on. Great for walking or on feet all day. Super light.
New_Balance,5,These sneakers are super comfortable and a great cross-trainer.  They held up to a diverse fitness routine and I will definitely be buying another pair.
New_Balance,5,"These sneakers are super comfortable from the first day of wearing them.  After a week of wearing them I ordered another pair so when these do wear out, I'll be ready with my new pair.  They slip on easily and the back on back goes with everything.  I just love them."
New_Balance,5,"These sneakers are super comfortable. I wear them all the time! You must try, you will not be disappointed."
New_Balance,5,These sneakers are the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever owned.  Love them
New_Balance,5,These sneakers are very comfortable and a great style. I wear mine when running errands or around the house. I wouldn’t suggest using these for high impact/ intense activity as they don’t actually lace tighter.
New_Balance,5,These sneakers feel good from the moment I put them on.  I wear Vionics alot for the arch support.  I was able to remove the insoles in these New Balance shoes and replace them with my Vionic insoles.  If you want an average amount of arch support these are great as is
New_Balance,5,These sneakers fit just right. Light and comfortable
New_Balance,5,"These tennis are perfect for me. Lightweight and easy to slip on and walk or exercise.
I will mention tho, I wish they had more arch support than they do. They are a comfortable shoe"
New_Balance,5,These tennis are very very comfortable! I bought two pair. Black and grey.
New_Balance,5,These tennis shoes are hands down the most comfortable I've ever owned. I have wide feet and pretty awful plantar fasciitis and wearing these is like walking on clouds. I love them so much that I now have 4 pairs in various colors!
New_Balance,5,These tennis shoes are so comfy and cute. Highly recommend!
New_Balance,5,These weigh NOTHING.  They’re soooo comfortable  I have FLAT feet and these keep me from having foot pain
New_Balance,5,These were comfortable right out of the box.  I always get a wife and they were perfect.  New Balance is always my go to shoe and I wasn’t disappointed.
New_Balance,5,These were just what I was looking for.  I got the all black ones.  They fit feat and are very comfortable.  Easy to slip on.  I have high arches and some of these types of tennis shoes are difficult to get on.  I wear them frequently but not all day every day.  I’ve not had any problems with the sole breaking down like other reviewers.
New_Balance,5,These were my Disney walking shoes and they did not disappoint...I did size up a half size per other reviewers recommendations and they fit perfectly. They were very comfortable for 10+ hour days of being on my feet and I had no rubbing or blisters. I liked that they were slip-on and the shoe laces weren't useless. The laces allowed you to tighten or loosen the fit - unlike a lot of the other slip-on sneakers.
New_Balance,5,These were perfect!!! I wore them all day at Magic Kingdom and Holkywood studios! So comfy and soooo many compliments!
New_Balance,5,"These were recommended to me by a friend who fell in love with them when she bought them. So I figured I’d give them a try, and I’m glad I did! It’s like wearing a plush sock. I hardly feel them on my feet but they keep my feet comfortable all day. Formfitting to the feet but still plenty of room for movement. I plan to buy a second pair! My friend now buys a pair for all of her friends birthdays LOL I highly recommend."
New_Balance,5,"These were the best shoes for my pregnant feet. So comfortable and supportive, but most importantly, I didn’t have to bend over to tie them!"
New_Balance,5,"These were true to size for me. I was skeptical after reading some reviews but mine were perfect. Very comfortable and light weight. I don’t wear socks with mine, that might make them tight for some people. I have been very satisfied with these. Not something I would use to go hiking but definitely a good amusement park shoe walking shoe or gym shoe."
New_Balance,5,These were unexpectedly way nicer than I thought. For a cheap pair of shoes they offer a lot of support and are super comfy. I wear them to work and do 12 hour shifts. So far they've held up for months.
New_Balance,5,These work great for me..I wear them for walking
New_Balance,5,"Theses are my new best shoes, love them and so comfortable. The only thing the inside of the shoe the bottom fabric come up easley. But I still have 3 pairs and buying more. Caregiver on my feet a lot."
New_Balance,5,They  are very comfortable and look nice too!
New_Balance,5,They are Awesome Perfect fit
New_Balance,5,they are becoming my favorite workout shoes and I bought a second pair
New_Balance,5,They are cheap shoes but for being cheap shoes they are fine
New_Balance,5,They are comfortable and lightweight. I love them because of how light they are. They're my second pair the first lasted me a year. I changed out the insoles but other that there great!
New_Balance,5,"They are definitely a small make. I can usually bank on an 8 in this type of shoe but the 8 was way too small.  I exchanged them for a 8.5 and they fit perfectly so I recommend bumping up a little.

I run but won’t be running in these. They are super adorable (black and animal print) and comfy but not supported for running/sports. If you’re looking for a super cute, comfy, everyday sneaker - this is is!!!"
New_Balance,5,They are exactly what I expected. I wear them a lot. They're comfortable and easy to slide on and off. I may have to get another pair.
New_Balance,5,"They are extremely light, have a memory foam insole and fit as expected if wearing not so thick socks. They look stylish and are comfortable for working out."

New_Balance,5,They are so comfortable!
New_Balance,5,They are so comfortable. Definitely getting a couple more pairs in different colors.
New_Balance,5,They are SO light!
New_Balance,5,They are super comfortable. They feel like they may slip off during a cardio workout but they stay on! Not sure about the metal balls on the end of the shoe laces because I did t like the clicking during my workout
New_Balance,5,They are the greatest. They are a prefect fit.
New_Balance,5,They are the most comfortable tennis shoes I have ever had. I am getting another pair!

New_Balance,5,They are very comfortable.
New_Balance,5,They are very lightweight and that is what I loved besides their comfy design.
New_Balance,5,They feel great...and look awesome too!
New_Balance,5,They feel very light and thin but I love the feel. The sole on one of the shoes came off when trying them on but I was put back into place without a problem. I just hope it doesn't keep happening.
New_Balance,5,They fit as expected. I got these because my arches would hurt when doing HIIT workouts. These have helped and have become my go to tennis shoes for everything but running.
New_Balance,5,"They fit comfortably and just right. Make sure you either go half a size up, they are a bit narrower than most sneakers. Thankfully I have small feet and didn’t need them wider."
New_Balance,5,They fit great and I could wear them all day long because of the comfort.
New_Balance,5,They fit great. They're comfortable and light.
New_Balance,5,They fit so well and look great with my workout attire. You definitely can't beat them for the price.

New_Balance,5,They look great
New_Balance,5,They look great with scrubs and are comfortable on cement floors. Bought my regular size and it fit great. Happy with my purchase.
New_Balance,5,"They look nice and are comfortable (according to her)
They also clean up very well in the washing machine."
New_Balance,5,They look nice feel nice. Got the light color cause it was cheaper wish I got a darker color because dirt shoes up easy. But overall design nice.
New_Balance,5,"They looked amazing, I’m a hairstylist and on my feet all day. At the end of the first day of use my feet felt amazing and didn’t hurt."
New_Balance,5,They may not be the prettiest shoes I’ve ever owned but they are extremely comfortable & lightweight. Great for long walks or if you’re on your feet all day. Also good for folks with bunions. There’s a wider toe base and the material is not rigid and very accommodating as to not squish and cause pain.
New_Balance,5,They provide the necessary support for their intended use.
New_Balance,5,They run very small I am a 7 with every brand but I can't get my foot in them and they have a high arch for my fellow flat foots....
New_Balance,5,"They wear really good, super comfy"
New_Balance,5,"They were a gift for my daughter, she likes them...that's all that matters.....great fit, great price....we are both HAPPY...!"
New_Balance,5,They were a little smaller than expected cause I got them as a 10.5 woman but other than that they are super cute and comfortable
New_Balance,5,They were shipped very quickly to me and they are so comfortable and lightweight. Reasonably priced!
New_Balance,5,"They were too small. I ordered a bigger size. Amazing quality and so comfortable. I am
usually an 8 1/2 so I would definitely size up a 1/2 of size.😍"
New_Balance,5,They’re cool
New_Balance,5,"They’re exactly what I wanted, I ordered a half size u. they fit perfect and they seem really comfortable :)"
New_Balance,5,They’re perfect
New_Balance,5,They’re really comfortable and lightweight.
New_Balance,5,"They’re roomier than I’m used to and I have pretty wide feet, but not too wide that my toes need to space out to hold a tight grip on the shoe so that it doesn’t fall off lol! They’re really stylish and clean looking. I’d advise to be careful walking around on some surfaces. The shoes are great in apartment building lobbies and outside on concrete sidewalks, however the tiles in my laundry room made for a super slippery surface. I slid around quite a bit and had to leave right away (I’m accident prone as it is). Other than that these sneakers are really nice."
New_Balance,5,They're comfortable.
New_Balance,5,Theyre like poofy comfortable clouds for the feet.  Fits perfectly. Definitely buying again
New_Balance,5,"They're super cute.  Loved the weight of them and the feel.  They were easy to get on.  I was a little surprised that they are more of a slip on instead of a lace up, but I liked that in the long run.  Sometimes I'm between a 9 1/2 and 10 and I had to return because I definitely needed the 10.  They're out of stock now, so as soon as they come back I'm grabbing them in 10s."
New_Balance,5,This are my absolute favorite shoes!
New_Balance,5,"This company is a USA family run business.  I love that first of all.  I needed this shoes because of some problems that I am having with my feet.  I read a review that told me these are great shoes for bunions, so I purchased them.  And...they are great.  They have great support, a wide toe box without any leather pressure, and they are stylish.  I would recommend them to anyone who has foot troubles..."
New_Balance,5,This is a cute shoe. Feels so good on! I wear orthotics. There is enough room for them and socks!
New_Balance,5,This is a good daily shoe. Something to throw on and go. I wouldn't do too much rigorous workout in them. I tend to destroy my shoes basically replace them often. So these are good to walk around in. I personally wouldn't go running in them. Lift weight yes. I got mine in 8.5 wide and they fit like a glove. not loose what so ever.
New_Balance,5,This is a great casual shoe. I have been wearing them to work we walk about 5 miles a day and have had no issues so far! Very comfortable and supportive sole. They are described as an athleisure shoe and I would agree I would not try to do much activity in them.
New_Balance,5,This is a great line - very comfortable and true to fit
New_Balance,5,This is a great pair of shoes and the person I bought them for wears them regularly. She says they’re simply awesome
New_Balance,5,This is a great shoe for walking.
New_Balance,5,"This is a great shoe. It is comfortable and supportive, a great shoe for walking."
New_Balance,5,"This is a perfect fit for New Balance (not matter what style, as long as you get same size and width)!!! It is a beautiful Disney shoe!! I am a huge Disney fan and these shoes are so cute and comfortable!! We just went to 3 parks today and walked around or to and from each park and my feet are happy!!!! 😃"
New_Balance,5,This is a replacement to my first pair. I also have in blue and plan to get in black. I have all the expensive sneakers but go to these most of the time.
New_Balance,5,"This is a very comfortable shoe.  It's like you're walking barefoot.
."
New_Balance,5,This is a very comfortable shoeN I love them!
New_Balance,5,"This is actually my second pair.  I take boxing classes at least 5 nights a week.  These are the most comfortable shoes that I have found for this type of workout.  After I received this pair I immediately ordered another pair so I can switch them out every other day.  They look great, are super comfortable and wear really well.  No problem with fit or width.  Will continue to purchase these shoes for working out."
New_Balance,5,"This is exactly what I’ve been looking for!!! So comfortable and my feet can breathe! As soon as I tried them on and jogged, I immediately bought another pair in a different color. BUY THEM. Very true to size."
New_Balance,5,This is my 2nd pair. Most comfortable shoe EVER. I walk on the insides of my feet and it really helps. Love all the varieties of colors.
New_Balance,5,This is my 2nd pair. They are so comfortable
New_Balance,5,"This is my 3rd pair of these shoes (all in different colors). They are so comfortable and go with everything. As a special education teacher, I never know when I'll have to take off running down the hall to assist with a student so these are really great for work. They're truly an everyday sneaker."
New_Balance,5,"This is my 3rd pair, I absolutely love them! Great shoe for everyday wear!"
New_Balance,5,"This is my first pair of New Balance shoes. I have heard from my friends in the past that it's a good brand but for their price didn't match my budget. So this time the price got right and I finally bought the shoes. I have to say that at first I thought this pair is kinda small and uncomfortable but then in 5-10 minutes of wearing them, they felt good. I almost didn't feel them on my feet. They are light and super good cross training shoes."
New_Balance,5,This is my first pair of New Balance sneakers and I LOVE them! They are so comfortable and came at a wonderful price.
New_Balance,5,"This is my first pair of non-running athletic shoes. They're lightweight, cushioned, fit perfectly, and look good outside the gym, which I could never say for running shoes. Been using them for a week for elliptical, stationary bike and weights. They've been perfect for gym workouts, but I wouldn't run in them."
New_Balance,5,This is my first time trying this brand of shoes and i absolutely love them. I feel like my feet have the perfect amount of room they need to be comfortable while working!
New_Balance,5,"This is my fourth pair of this shoe, just a different color. Love love love them. Most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever had!"
New_Balance,5,"This is my second pair like this, and I love them both! So comfortable, light, and breathable! Great purchase."
New_Balance,5,"This is my second pair now of these shoes. I work on my feet all day and as I’m getting older i realized i needed much better support. I never realized until i got these shoes how big of a difference a wider shoe would make. These are comfy for all day wear. I wouldn’t say the insert is super soft or memory foam like but it has some cushion. Overall, these are the best I’ve found so far for all day wear."
New_Balance,5,"This is my second pair of New Balance FuelCore and I will forever buy these as long as they are made! I feel as if I am walking on clouds, that's how comfortable they are. The memory foam sole is perfect since I am on my feet all day! Highly recommended!"
New_Balance,5,This is my second pair of shoes in the brand and style. So comfortable and easy to put on and off.
New_Balance,5,This is my second pair of these New Balance shoes - I love them! They are so comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"This is my second pair of these New Balance. The first pair I purchased was over a year ago and wore them all over Europe right out of the box with no issues, and I wear them constantly still. They are super easy to clean (wash in the evening and air dried by morning).
I have to wear special insoles for arch support and they fit perfectly in my New Balance, especially since the factory insole comes out easily. Also, the tongue doesn’t move and I use them as slip on and off shoes."
New_Balance,5,This is my second pair of these shoes and I absolutely love them. So lightweight and comfortable! 10/10 recommend!
New_Balance,5,"This is my second pair of these shoes and i LOVE them! I bought my first pair over a year ago that i garden with and wear during yard work, they are still holding up! When i say garden and yard work i mean like 8 hours of dirt, mud, water, digging, planting and mowing 3x or more a week!!
I bought the second pair for everyday wear as my clean ones. I definitely recommend these for people who are on their feet a lot, the memory foam really makes a difference."
New_Balance,5,This is my second pair of these shoes and I’m certain it won’t be my last. These are great shoes for my daily walks.
New_Balance,5,This is my second pair of these shoes in a different color. Super comfortable and cute.
New_Balance,5,"This is my second pair of these shoes, and while comfortable, they seem to run about a half size too small."
New_Balance,5,"This is my second pair of these shoes. This time, I ordered a medium width, and had to exchange it for a wide width.
Because I have to remove the inner lining and replace with my own arch support, I cannot rate the support.  I like this shoe because of the soft, stretchy material. I have bunions, and these shoes mold nicely . Very comfy, and also I like the look."
New_Balance,5,This is my second pair! Love them! Tried to buy them from a sports retailer but my size wasn't available. Thrilled to find them on Amazon. So comfortable!
New_Balance,5,"This is my second pair. I am an avid walker and once I find a shoe I like, I have learned to buy 2. The original purchase was from a brick and mortar store. Once I wore them on the treadmill several times, I ordered these from Amazon. The shoe is roomy at the toe allowing your foot to fall naturally when walking at the brisk pace. The shoe strings set on the top of your foot just behind your arch so there is nothing to restrict your foot from bending. They are light weight and easy to get on and off. Unlike ""running"" shoes, these do not have an excessively thick sole."
New_Balance,5,This is my second pair. Love! Cheaper on Amazon then DSW!
New_Balance,5,This is my second pair. So comfortable!
New_Balance,5,This is my second pair. Very comfortable and casual. I really like them
New_Balance,5,This is my second time purchasing these sneakers.  I love them! SO comfortable and are really cute.
New_Balance,5,This is my third pair. I love the style.
New_Balance,5,"This is now the second pair of these shoes I’ve purchased. I bought my first pair from DSW for about $15 more than I paid for the second pair from Amazon. So this was a good deal, in my opinion. Comfortable and breathable shoes, great for the gym. Okay for lots of walking as long as you don’t have feet problems. I had to put orthotic inserts in them, but that’s a me issue. Overall good quality, comfortable athletic shoes."
New_Balance,5,"This is one of the best shoes that I have ever purchased. It is very comfortable and they make your feet look skinnier!!  The inside top layer has begun to come off after 2 months of wear, but that’s okay.  I just ordered some insoles.  I will continue to buy them as long as new balance makes them!"
New_Balance,5,"This is probably the most comfortable pair
Of sneakers I have had in my whole life. I absolutely love them. Bought a pair for my husband too"
New_Balance,5,"This is really the best sneakers I've had :) I can walk, run or do anything for hours :) Perfect. Highly recommend"
New_Balance,5,This is second pair love these
New_Balance,5,This is some bang for your buck!! These are so light and airy.  The perfect summertime tennis shoe. So comfy and fit true to size.
New_Balance,5,This is such a comfortable shoe. I got them to wear them inside not to exercise. Easy to wash too.
New_Balance,5,This is such a great shoe to workout in. Very light weight and comfortable. Plus the color is so cute
New_Balance,5,This is the 2nd pair of these shoes I've purchased and I absolutely love them! The memory foam insole is a nice touch and not having to find socks to wear with them is an added bonus :)
New_Balance,5,"This is the best every day tennis shoe! I love the comfort of the insole and the lightweight material.

This is a great choice!

Update: I bought a second pair because I love them so much."
New_Balance,5,"This is the best shoes, I love them, they fit perfect and they are so soft !  Thinking in buy in another colors"
New_Balance,5,This is the first shoe I've bought that I've been able to work out in and my feet don't hurt. I'm doing circuit training 3x a week and have only been doing for a few months. These shoes have given me major relief to focus on my workout and not my feet.
New_Balance,5,"This is the first time I have bought shoes online with out trying first. I saw these in a store, liked the sleek, non-bulky look. Decided to try and order them since I could not find correct size in the stores. I ordered a 7 1/2, ended up exchanging for a 7 1/2 wide as the original was a little snug in the toes. I love these shoes, so lightweight and comfortable. I put them on and wore all day around the house with no problems. Looking forward to taking them for a walk!  They were also shipped quicker than expected. I would purchase again."
New_Balance,5,"This is the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned!  Love the style, color.  Comfy and cozy right out of the box!  Try them you don’t be disappointed."
New_Balance,5,"THIS IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOE I HAVE ORDER IN A LONG TIME. PLAN TO GET THREE MORE COLORS. GREAT FOR WALKING OR BEING ON YOUR FEET FOR A LONG TIME. I LOVE THEM, I NORMALLY DO NOT WRITE PRODUCT REVIEWS UNLESS I AM MORE THAN PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT (THE PRODUCT HAS TO BE MORE THAN OK). I MUST SAY THAT I AM."
New_Balance,5,"This is the most comfortable, very cute sneakers I have ever found.  It fits just perfect, makes your feet look so small, good support for my aerobics, not tight fits perfectly.  I absolutely love it, it's the best."
New_Balance,5,"This is the second pair I have. Very comfortable and have had complements.  I wasn’t able to order a color I wanted, but black was fine."
New_Balance,5,"This is the second pair I’ve bought, my first are Minnie Mouse lol. There are the most comfortable shoes! I wear them standing on my feet 10+ hours at work every day and still choose to wear them on my off days."
New_Balance,5,This is the second pair of these shoes I’ve bought.  They are super cute and comfy.  It is easy to slip into them and I have high arches which sometimes makes it difficult with these types of shoes.
New_Balance,5,"This is the second pair of this style that I have purchased. They are hands down the most light weight, comfortable, and flexible sneakers I have owned. I have a bunion and other feet issues; so I have to be very selective with shoes. I actually bought two more pairs. The gray and the black ones. The only con I found is that they don’t have strong traction; so when I walk into the sauna at my gym the floors are wet from the pool and the shoes can be quite slippery. Other than that I think they are perfect. Also, I wore my first pair for a whole year and they held up really well."
New_Balance,5,This is the third pair i have purchased because they are so comfortable. I hope they never change them.
New_Balance,5,"This is the third pair of the exact same shoe, just in a different color. I hate wearing shoes, but these sneakers are so lightweight and comfortable that it doesn’t feel like I’m wearing shoes. Highly recommend."
New_Balance,5,"This lightweight, slip on shoe fits as expected. I’ve worn these for over a year and they have held up very well. I use them for everyday wear and would buy them again."
New_Balance,5,This may have been my first time buying shoes online without trying them on and I love them. The stretch band allows the shoe to give me room when I run and yet is still snug and comfortable. I will def be buying more of these when my current ones wear out.
New_Balance,5,"This New Balance sneaker is perfect for gym workout, walking and running. PERFECT FIT and it is so comfortable! So satisfied with product and shippment."
New_Balance,5,This pair fit as well as the last pair I bought
New_Balance,5,This pair of shoes is just what I needed. It is lightweight and very versatile for casual wear.  I'm hoping it will stretch out some to be a little more comfortable over time.
New_Balance,5,This product fit really well. I love them if you have wide feet these are a must have. First pair of athletic shoes I’ve ever had that are not uncomfortable.
New_Balance,5,This product is made to fit so you may want to go a size up for toe space...everything else was good...I love the fit and feel on my feet.
New_Balance,5,"This shoe fir me perfectly.  I have difficult feet to fit as they are long and narrow and I need a wide toe box.
This shoe fit me perfectly, very comfy,  and I am very happy with them."
New_Balance,5,"This shoe fits like a glove, it’s a narrow fitted shoe and it’s light weight. It fits my foot so well and has good arch support for my feet. I tried them out while weight training and payed attention to every detail of movement and I enjoyed them! It also has a comfortable memory foam sole. The laces don’t need to be tied if you don’t want it to but I decided to tie them tight to get an added support.  Thanks for creating a great shoe!"
New_Balance,5,"This shoe has a comfortable toe box, that is symmetrical to the overall style of the shoe. This is all topped off with sexy straps angled just right to offer the utmost arch support. A great walking shoe."
New_Balance,5,This shoe has been a lifesaver at work. I will order a second pair. I had surgery for plantar fasciitis and this shoe has helped in my recovery.
New_Balance,5,"This shoe I buy it second time. Perfect , good Quality, not heavy."
New_Balance,5,"This shoe is a great fit in a wide size. It fit perfectly, and is a good quality shoe. Highly recommend it!"
New_Balance,5,This shoe is a great light fit.  Comfortable for short walks or running errands.
New_Balance,5,"This shoe is amazing. However it about an inch to short. My toe touches the front of the shoe. New balances are known for this. So I wound suggest going a half size up just to be safe. However, despite that. It’s a comfortable shoe."
New_Balance,5,"This shoe is amazing. I have been looking for a good shoe I can wear all day, and to Disneyland this shoe is it. Wasn’t even hard to break in. I will
Be buying them in every color"
New_Balance,5,"This shoe is extremely comfortable, adorable and an excellent buy! Disney here I come"
New_Balance,5,"This shoe is great!  I might even get another pair in another color! They are so supportive and stylish - I get so many compliments on them.  However, they arrived damaged - the back loop was torn off. I was very disappointed that my new shoes were broken!  I did not return, as exchanges are excruciatingly painful, and repaired myself."
New_Balance,5,This shoe is lightweight but supportive and comfortable.  I needed a wider toe base that didn’t end up being too big at the heel.
New_Balance,5,This shoe is like walking on a cloud. It does need a separate insole for arch support (I have a high arch) but I walked 16-18 miles a day for 9 days in Europe and my feet never hurt. I ordered 2 more pairs just in case they're discontinued!
New_Balance,5,This shoe is really the most comfortable tennis shoe I've ever worn.  Thankfully they come in wide widths and the fit is perfect.  I like them so much I have three pairs in different colors.
New_Balance,5,This shoe is soo comfortable and my feet don’t hurt being on them for hours on end! Highly recommend!
New_Balance,5,This shoe is the most comfortable shoe I have worn in a long time. Even walking is light and extra comfortable.
New_Balance,5,This shoe is very comfortable. I haven't worked out in them yet.
New_Balance,5,"This shoe is very surprising. It has ties you can tighten, but also has a slip on function. I love the golden detail on the ties, and the leopard print, it brings them up a level while being super comfy."
New_Balance,5,This shoe runs very small!  I had to return 3 times to get right size. My daughter loves them though!
New_Balance,5,"This shoes are awesome!... They are comfy, and beautiful!, and have Minnie, and light weigh... it feels like socks!... Love it!"
New_Balance,5,"This shoes have perfect room in the toe box. I was thinking I wanted to order a wide, but I am glad I ordered regular size. I use an insert on my shoes and there was room for the exchange."
New_Balance,5,This shoes is so comfortable and fits so well on my feet. I have so much support while walking and I don't feel like my shoes are going to slip off.
New_Balance,5,This sneaker is just what you need after a long day of work. It is comfortable and soft like a sock. It is sturdy enough for everyday wear.
New_Balance,5,This sneaker is so comfortable. Ordered it in 8.5 wide due to a bunion.  Plenty of room for thin or thick sock.  Will definately order again!
New_Balance,5,This sneakers was the lightest I felt I was walking on air comfort I'm gonna buy another pair
New_Balance,5,"This tennis shoe is nice looking, very comfortable and was purchased at a great sales price. Pleased with my purchase and would recommend this shoe to others."
New_Balance,5,This walking sneaker is extremely lightweight and comfortable. Wonderful choice!
New_Balance,5,"This was definitely money will spent...I walk 5 days a week for approximately 2 hours just for exercise.  The shoes are great to walk in, they’re light and comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"This was my second pair, and I love them. Extremely comfy. No socks needed when is hot outside."
New_Balance,5,Tight fit
New_Balance,5,Too narrow for my foot. Even tried to get the next size up in wide. No good.
New_Balance,5,Totally love the look and the fit!!!  Great pair of shoes!!
New_Balance,5,"Tried it on in stores and scanned with amazon app. Amazon won again :). Comfy shoe, looks sleek for use with shorts. Not good for biking or hiking since they are pretty thin you can feel the uneven surface through your shoe."
New_Balance,5,"True fit! Comfy, stretch and light weight!"
New_Balance,5,"True to size, a little narrow, but I have narrow feet. Super light weight and adorable! Very comfortable."
New_Balance,5,"True to size, and so comfortable. I love the look of these shoes! Great for work, exercise, or just to wear!"
New_Balance,5,"True to size, very comfortable and very cute shoes! I was concerned that with the stationary tongue, I would have issues getting them on, but I didn't have any problems. I love New Balance sneakers and these ones did not disappoint!"
New_Balance,5,"True to size, very lightweight, and comfy from the start. Went for a three mile walk my first time wearing. No problems! I got the black with red stripe. I didn't check the images closely enough to see that It is Disney themed, with a Minnie Mouse shoelace charm, but the charm is removable."
New_Balance,5,True to size. I'm very impressed with the quality and comfort of these shoes. Lightweight and very comfortable. Definitely worth the price.
New_Balance,5,Truly a very comfortable shoe. I wear them to the gym and when I go for long walks.
New_Balance,5,"Truly feels like you’re waking on a cloud. When I picked the box up I was worried because it felt so light I thought maybe they sent me the wrong item. Nope, the shoe is just that light! I spent 70 dollars on my nikes and they aren’t even half as comfy as these! 10/10"
New_Balance,5,"Un buen productor, muy contento"
New_Balance,5,Unfortunately they are no well made- the toe on one shoe has ripped and i have not even worn them much at all due to covid and being home.
New_Balance,5,"Update: I do love the way these sneakers fit and feel BUT they both have developed a loud clicking/snapping sound when I walk - it's very annoying!

I have these in black and wanted a pair for the summer.  I tried the white (too white), the tan (just ok), and finally, the light grey. Third time's a charm! I love them!"
New_Balance,5,Use for walking and love!
New_Balance,5,Use them on a daily basis for work as an MA at a very busy office. Comfort is a must
New_Balance,5,Use these at work — very comfortable and I’m on my feet all day. Also durable enough in a standard washer/dryer.

New_Balance,5,Used for exercise!!! Great feel

New_Balance,5,Usually wear an 8-8.5 and the 8.5 is perfect. SO LIGHT! Barely I can tell I have them on.

New_Balance,5,"Very comfortable shoe! Runs about a whole size small, though."
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable shoe.  My daughter is very rough on shoes.  They are not the best quality. But comfortable.
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable shoe. Lightweight. wouldn’t be great support for working out. I usually wear wide but the wide is loose. I probably would stick to regular width unless you need XXWide.
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable shoe. Usually wear a 7 but had to side up a half size.
New_Balance,5,"Very comfortable shoe..  it’s strictly for training.  There’s not enough support for walking or running,  but the shoes are perfect for strength training."

New_Balance,5,"Very comfortable shoes! Great for walking and being on your feet all day. They look flat, but do offer good support.  I ordered a half size up which was recommended by other reviews, and they fit perfect.
The shade of black is a little off lol but not too noticeable"
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable shoes. I have wide feet and high arch so toe box and elastic sides accommodated nicely.
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable shoes. I needed something for indoor use with all the home workouts I had been doing. I needed shoes that wouldn’t slip and were still comfortable enough to perform the variety of exercises including HIIT. These are lightweight and offer the grip required sometimes a bit too much - watch out when performing some of the fast feet movements. The only downside would be as some others have mentioned - wear thin socks. The shoes feel extra tight with moderately thick socks.
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable shoes. I think the 9.5 size would had better for me but I never have had shoes that big. They are easy to put on and off since they slip off but have lace to tighten. Got them since recommended in Good Housekeeping without breaking the bank.
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable slip on gym shoes
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable sneaker. Highly recommend! I'd had cheilectomy surgery and these sneakers are the only shoes after getting relief from the boot after surgery that are the most comfortable.

New_Balance,5,Very comfortable sneakers for cardio and training. This is my second pair and I love them!!

New_Balance,5,Very comfortable.  The color and size is what I was hoping for.
New_Balance,5,"Very comfortable.  Toe box is really large, plenty of room for toes to spread.  I have difficulty walking even short distances, but these are helping.  Usually I add orthotics, but these are so comfy I don't need.  I will probably do so later as the cushioning flattens."
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable. Bought these for work since I'm on my feet the whole time.
New_Balance,5,very comfortable. Good fit
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable. Happy with the width.
New_Balance,5,Very comfortable. I barely feel any weight. Perfect walking shoes.

New_Balance,5,"Very comfy, like wearing a slipper. But. Should have listened to other reviewers who suggested ORDER 1/2 SIZE UP."

New_Balance,5,Very cute and comfortable
New_Balance,5,Very cute and comfy shoes I love them! Beware they run smallllll. I usually wear and 8 and sometimes and 8 1/2 so I ordered 8 1/2 but they were still too small. These are my only shoes I own in a 9!
New_Balance,5,Very cute and comfy.
New_Balance,5,Very cute and cozy
New_Balance,5,"Very cute and more importantly, very comfy! Had them for about a month now and have no complaints. With that being said, I don't use them for high endurance workouts or running. I bought these for running errands and
 doing Pilates or low impact exercising. So far I haven't found anything I don't like about them. As far as the comments I read about size running small, I didn't have that problem. I ordered my regular size and if anything they were slightly roomier, but not big."
New_Balance,5,"Very cute as pictures, light and I like the memory foam but not a lot of support. Kind of hard to get on the opening is smaller but once on they are great!"
New_Balance,5,Very cute I get a lot of compliments. Very lightweight but still good cushioning. I am active on my feet all day and my feet feel good even at the end of the day and I’ve been wearing these about 2 months

New_Balance,5,Very nice & slick looking shoes. They are narrow but that works well for me. I purchased these to help with my plantar fasciitis specifically in my heels. It took about a week or two to get adjusted but they help tremendously.
New_Balance,5,Very nice and comfortable true to size. I have a wide foot 🦶 but l didn’t get wide size the regular one is perfect

New_Balance,5,Very very cute !! They are on the smaller side but I have narrow feet so they fit perfect.
New_Balance,5,"Very, very comfortable!  I stand for 12-14 hours at work as a nurse (run at times...lol), and these are so comfortable!"
New_Balance,5,Walked 100 miles at Disney over 10 days (not kidding- fitbit tracked every step) and my feet for once did not hurt!  Whole heartedly recommend these- even bought a pair for my Mom for Christmas!
New_Balance,5,"Walking and elliptical, usually wear 7 but in sneakers 7.5 and they fit perfect.  Love them and so cute"
New_Balance,5,Walking great support
New_Balance,5,"Walking, walking and walking"
New_Balance,5,"Wanted a light weight shoe that looks good but was comfortable also, This was perfect"
New_Balance,5,Was a little skeptical from some of the reviews. But they are soooo comfy and true to size! I work on my feet all day in the hospitality industry and couldn’t have asked for anything better!
New_Balance,5,"Was hesitant to order these but glad I did. They are cuter in person. Super comfortable, and food support I wear them for indoor cycling."
New_Balance,5,"Was looking for a nice pair of tennis shoes just to wear around the house, to the grocery store, etc. This was exactly what I was looking for at a great price. Came in the box with tissue paper and everything as I had bought at a retail store."
New_Balance,5,Was looking for a wide width walking shoe. Width is perfect but shoe feels rather light and material not very substantial.
New_Balance,5,"Was pleasantly surprised when I slipped these bad boys on! I have bigger ankles than people my size so I often feel like my ankles look stubby in shoes. These were the exception. They’re very low profile and stylish. I sent a picture of them to a friend and he was impressed. Asked who made them and was even more impressed that it was a new balance shoe.

A+"
New_Balance,5,Washes really well
New_Balance,5,Wasn't looking for new shoes but these caught my eye. My shoe size varies depending on brand and style. These seem to run a but small so order at least half a size up if not a whole size. They are really soft and comfortable though!
New_Balance,5,Wasn't sure what to expect but really like these sneakers!
New_Balance,5,We purchased these shoes for our granddaughter for her 1st day at a new job where she is on her feet most of the day.  She has reported that they are still comfortable at the end of they day and they look good too.
New_Balance,5,Wear to work everyday
New_Balance,5,"Well, let me just start by saying I love love these shoes they are so comfortable I have charcoal grey also...I just purchased these shoes last week wore them for the second time today. I went over to my 66-year-old mother's house and she put them on, and let's just say I no longer own them. I walked out of her house with only my socks on literally...she said she needed them more than I did and I could buy another pair...so drove home and bought myself another pair...Thank you New Balance. (true story)"
New_Balance,5,Were better then expected and I have loved these shoes. They were a birthday gift and they are so perfect.
New_Balance,5,"What a difference a pair of shoes makes! These are like walking on a cloud for both everyday wear and workouts. I broke them in at boot camp yesterday, and they were beyond comfortable. Can't recommend these enough, especially for women with wide feet."
New_Balance,5,"What a difference a pair of shoes makes! These are like walking on a cloud for both everyday wear and workouts. I broke them in at boot camp yesterday, and they were beyond comfortable. Can't recommend these enough, especially for women with wide feet."
New_Balance,5,What ever size you are buy that size. These shoes are so comfortable. These are my second pair.
New_Balance,5,"When I first took these out of the box I was a little disappointed. They felt so flimsy and unlike my other athletic shoes. But after wearing them for a workout I fell in love. These are the softest, lightest shoes I've ever had. They're absolutely perfect for gym workouts. I would not recommend these for running as there is very little arch support and you'd be asking for shin splints. But for weightlifting, basic cardio, walking, and just for fashion these are excellent - and cute!"
New_Balance,5,"When I opened the box, I thought I received kids shoes by mistake. Nope...they fit!!!
These shoes are lightweight, easy for me to put on and take off and they are cushy. I wish they had more arch support because that's what NB typically offers. These were priced lower than one would expect, though.
I bought them for walking and may order another pair 1/2 a size bigger to make room for my arch supports."
New_Balance,5,"When I ordered my first pair, they were too short, even though I ordered my regular size.  Turns out my foot had changed.  ( I tried on some shoes I'd had for a while and they no longer fit!)
So I ordered a replacement pair, one size longer.  They are comfortable.  I walk about 30 min a day and they stay tied and feel great."
New_Balance,5,"When I saw they offered these shoes in all black, wide & under $70, I had to jump on them. I am SO GLAD I did. I did not realize until today that I have never purchased a pair of shoes put them on & actually truly had them fit without needing to “break them in” (thank you wide feet) I am already looking at other colors. One thing....listen to the other commenters that say go a half size up, I got a 9 but should’ve gotten a 9.5, they run big."
New_Balance,5,"When I tell you, you need these, stop reading and order you a pair, BUT size up! These shoes will make you want to walk. So much better and worth the $ than nike, & adidas & I have BOTH brands and several and I stumbled on these gems and never went back since PLEASE KEEP THESE STOCKED AND IN ALL THE COLORS. IM OBSESSED."
New_Balance,5,"When I unpacked the box, it was so light that I cannot believe it was a pair of shoes inside. I usually wear us size 6 shoes and this pair fits perfectly. It was very comfy to walk and jog with!"
New_Balance,5,Wide width lovers- look no further! So comfortable and very cute on my wide foot
New_Balance,5,Wide. Lightweight. Quality material. Love these.
New_Balance,5,wife is happy with them
New_Balance,5,"Wife loves the sneaker, says it is super comfortable and her feet don’t hurt after a long day since she started wearing these."
New_Balance,5,Wish it had a thicker insole.  Very thin--I feel like I am walking right on the surface of the floor.
New_Balance,5,Wish the shoe was a little bit more narrow in the front end.
New_Balance,5,"Wonderful I love it.
It is soft and very comfortable"
New_Balance,5,Wonderful lightweight sneakers!
New_Balance,5,Wonderful!  These are the most comfortable shoes I have had for walking since I had a total hip replacement in Jan. 2020.  I can comfortably walk 1 1/2 miles.  I just bought a second pair.
New_Balance,5,"Wonderfully comfortable shoe! Great for walking, spent four days at Disney and my feet felt fantastic."
New_Balance,5,Wore around the house to break in. Comfortable and easy to move around in.
New_Balance,5,"Wore for a few hours, comfortable but Does not provide the support I was looking for. Will wear as a casual shoe."
New_Balance,5,"Wore these sneakers all summer long! Threw them in the wash and they look brand new.
Very comfortable. Love them!"
New_Balance,5,Would have liked a bit more cushion in foot bed
New_Balance,5,"Would order again, comfortable and nice looking."
New_Balance,5,"Wow I didn’t even need to break these shoes in:)
No blisters, and they fit perfectly!
So much better than my Adidas, Nikes, or Sketchers."
New_Balance,5,"Wow,  these are the best pair of shoes ever purchased for my situation. I have better balance and more comfort."
New_Balance,5,Wrong color run small.

Nike,5,"Amazingly lightweight, I wear a 7.5 in sneakers, and a 7.5 in this fits perfectly. I had to loosen up the laces to make it fit better. The laces are short as you can in the photo, but it’s not a big deal. A good value overall."

Nike,5,"Dude, I bought these to work out, which I haven't really gotten around to yet, but I'd ordered another pair of dress shoes along with them, and I walk quite a bit, so they made my heels hurt, and I got shin splints. So I decided to wear these for a more casual occasion, and they are so comfortable! I'd been wearing dress shoes for like two years straight, walking miles a day, and these made such a difference. They're also pretty cute! I work at a hotel, and they didn't seem too out of place with my uniform, and I've gotten a lot of compliments!"
Nike,5,"During this quarantine, I couldn’t trust ordering a new pair so I re bought these because they were comfortable and promising the first time around. They were still really durable a year after but I dropped paint on mine so here I am."

Nike,5,Great shoes. Very very comfortable. First time wearing them I was a part of an all day walking relay and it was like walking on a cloud six hours later still. I was surprised how much more comfortable this were than other Nike trainer shoes I’ve had previously.  I also received multiple compliments on the look of the shoe. The rose gold is not very pink though. More of a bronze gold but pretty still. Very happy with purchase.
Nike,5,Great sneakers she’ll love them!

Nike,5,I absolutely love these shoes. They are so light weight and comfortable !
Nike,5,I absolutely love these shoes. They fit perfectly and they are so comfortable.
Nike,5,I absolutely love these sneakers!!!
Nike,5,I already had a pair of these comfort shoes for the past 4 years.  I  felt it was time for a new pair.  I considered several options before realizing I already had the perfect style for me. So this is my 2nd purchase of the same shoe style.
Nike,5,"I always wear Nikes, and these have proven to be very comfortable walking shoes. They are marketed as running shoes, but since I'm not a runner and wanted a solid white sneaker, these turned out to be perfect."
Nike,5,"I am extremely pleased with the delivery and the product!  These shoes have saved my life!  I work part-time for a network and several times per year we have to work at different shows.  Well, I have tried every show from less expensive to very expensive and by day two and definitely by day 4 (because of the extended walking and standing required) my feet and legs hurt so bad that I wanted to cut my legs off at the knee and sit them on the side! Lol. I am literally on my feet for 8-16 hours per day!
So, I went online and typed “most comfortable Nike shoe,” and this one popped up, and the reviews were on target!  I can honestly say that these are the most comfortable shoe I could have ever purchased!  The only thing I would mention is that they run about a 1/2-1 size too small.  I purchased the first pair from Nike and when I went back to purchase a larger size they were out of stock.  Fortunately they were available from another vendor and I was able to get them delivered before I left for my trip."
Nike,5,I am pleased with my purchase.
Nike,5,I am very happy with the fit and style of this product.
Nike,5,I bartender 40 plus hours a week and these shoes get me through the shift.
Nike,5,I bought a 71/2 and it fits perfect buy your size you’ll be fine ! I buy my sneakers a half size up for room for my socks I’m actually a 7 in heels but I go 7/12 and it’s not too much bigger it’s fine ! For narrow feet nice and lightweight very breathable shoe ! Nice inside cushion!

Now she comments these shoes are perfect.  Very comfortable, stylish, and like she Is walking on air.  She is a happy Nike fan!"
Nike,5,I have 3 of them!
Nike,5,I have a super high arch so it’s comfy but I could use even more of an arch support inside. Looks very clean in design and is very light in weight. Overall quite happy!

Nike,5,I have to wear these for dance and I really enjoy the comfort and stability I have when using these
Nike,5,"I have two other pairs of these Nikes in different colors and these were exactly as I expected them to be. I love this style of Nike. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis that causes a lot of pain in my ankles and toes with some shoes. I’ve found that I don’t have to worry about that pain with these Nikes which is why I’ve bought the same style in additional colors. The width is perfect, the footbed is comfortable and soft, and they’re true to size. I absolutely love them!"

I don’t write reviews very often but thought I would share this, for anyone considering buying these. They were worth it to me."

Nike,5,"I love these shoes. I buy the same style over and over for running.  Light weight and cute, come in many different colors.  The only down fall would be the lack of arch support.  I wear with inserts so I don't have any problem, I want to make clear that I do not give the arch support 5 stars."
Nike,5,I love these shoes. They are so comfy and supportive. They are good for running and everyday tasks. I’ve ordered two pairs so far and they are amazing

Nike,5,"I ordered Nike Women's Tanjun Running Shoes for my daughter who works as a trainer at a gym.

Alas, Cinderella says Nike Women's Tanjun Running Shoes are way comfier than glass slippers."
Nike,5,"I ordered these shoes for my granddaughter's birthday. Unfortunately my daughter gave me the wrong size, however, being Nike brand shoes she was able to exchange them in person at a local retail store. My granddaughter loves them."

Nike,5,I purchased a pair from Kohls but then saw Amazon sold for a cheaper price. I bought these taking a risk of receiving fakes. Once these arrived in the mail I compared them and scrutinized every bit of detail to the ones from Kohls. My conclusion is that these are 100% real and not fakes at all. For the price it's a great deal! A plus to this was the shoes came brand new. Bottom of shoes were completely white.
Nike,5,"I purchased these shoes based totally on reviews , and I am so glad i did. I have had 8 Achilles tendon surgeries on right foot and needed comfort and stability for walking. I usually wear padded slippers all day due to shoes rubbing on Achilles tendon causing excruciating pain. These shoes fit perfectly and the comfort is beyond anything I expected especially with my injury. From the moment I put these  on I was in love. I will never buy another brand of tennis shoes this is my go to shoe. Please try for yourself as you can return if unsatisfied."
Nike,5,I put them on and wore them all day... They are wonderful.  I have serious problems with my poor feet and I'm in love with my new shoes!! Gonna get another pair as soon as I can decide on the color.  Very happy with this purchase.
Nike,5,"I read an article that these were great for people who stand all day and provides good support, and they've done exactly that. I took out the insoles and put in my orthotics and they've been great for walking and standing. Highly recommend."
Nike,5,"I read other reviews of women who had foot problems and these shoes helped their feet. Well, I'm all in on that conclusion. These are the best shoes I've had in eons. I definitely recommend these shoes and will definitely buy another pair. As a side benefit, the other night I spilled tea and some of iit got  on my shoe. I took a damp sponge and wiped it off -- good as new!! Worth every penny."
Nike,5,I really like this shoes
Nike,5,I really liked them I will buy more shoes for Amazon
Nike,5,I really loved these shoes exceeded my expectations
Nike,5,I really needed new running shoes and these were the perfect match! Comfortable and stylish! I got wide due to having issues with past shoes and its been great! not much arch support so be careful there but they work for me and I do have high arches.
Nike,5,I received the shoes before the date expected. It was great!
Nike,5,"I sized up, they run a little small (about 1/2 size). Very comfortable, really cute. I have several pairs of these same shoes and love them."
Nike,5,"I usually don’t purchase Nike’s because I’d never found a pair with the arch support I need. These are different; they are so comfortable and provide great support for my feet. The shoes are solid, while also being breathable. A+."
Nike,5,I walk a lot for work and needed some new sneakers and I made the right choice. These sneakers are light and made for walking.

Nike,5,"I was a little nervous to purchase these at first since they weren’t directly from Nike but I am so glad that I did! These shoes are so much comfier than I expected and they go great with any casual or workout look! Very satisfied with these shoes.

Nike,5,"I wear 7, but typicaly am between 6.5 and 7 with Nike. I ordered 6.5 and they fit well."
Nike,5,I wear a 9.5 and the 9.5 fit perfectly. The perfect amount of toe space for my toes to move around. I’m a vet tech and these keep my feet from hurting after a long shift.
Nike,5,I wear a women’s size 8 but always purchase big kids size 7 in Nike because they are significantly less expensive. I love this brand! This is my 4th pair and the color on these is a bright coral but not too neon. I would say they are good for walking and everyday wear but not running. No heel rub and my arch is supported.
Nike,5,"I wear orthotics daily, so comfort and fit are very important. That said, these shoes are not only attractive, they are extremely comfortable. I have a pair in pink that I've been wearing in summer and am thrilled with the dark color for winter. Get many compliments."

Nike,5,I wish the top portion had a little more support
Nike,5,"I wore these shoes for the first time today, for the entire day at work, on my feet all day.  They absolutely felt great!  Not one ache or pain which ALWAYS happens with new shoes."
Nike,5,I work 9 hours on feet with barely a break. Used these even up to 9 months pregnant working. So comfy and light and breathable. Had no back pains.
Nike,5,I work in a factory setting and these shoes are wonderful for walking
Nike,5,"I work in healthcare where I spend long hours on my feet,standing,walking,moving around. I needed a comfortable shoes, and I gotta say this right here is my go to . I wear it almost everyday, I wear it every time I gotta go to work. Support my feet perfectly, fits perfectly, feels super light and comfy, and very durable. A must buy."
Nike,5,"I work in retail and stand/walk for 8-hour shifts. I tried all kinds of shoes (including other Nikes) and different shoe inserts to help ease the pain in my feet at the end of the day. These shoes feel like like walking on a cloud! My feet don’t hurt at the end of the day, and I don’t  have to wear ugly orthopedic shoes. These are great looking and functional. If you have foot pain like I do from being on your feet all day, BUY THESE SHOES."
Nike,5,I work in the ER and am constantly running around.  These sneakers are super comfortable and offer great support.
Nike,5,"I work on my feet 90% of the time.  Being someone who already has foot problems, these shoes surpassed my expectations.  I have much less foot pain after my shifts.  Very happy with my purchase."

I ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfectly as well as being very comfy and sturdy. 10/10 recommend and i dont know if it'/ just me but the soles seem to be quite thick and like very dense foam?

Nike,5,"My first pair I got from a lost and found... They were well used and who knows how long the previous owners had them. I wore those shoes everyday for 2 years. I wore these until my toes started poking through the top and had no traction left on the bottom. They were my work shoes, my running shoes and shoes for just walking the dog or going to the store. They are light weight, well ventilated and extremely comfortable, so I just had to get another pair! This time I got to pick the color though... Seeing as the ones I found were purple, haha."

Nike,5,"Pedir zapatos por internet es un tanto abrumador ya que no sabemos que tal nos quedará por más medidas que le demos a nuestro pie, pero sin duda he comprobado que tiene que ver mucho la marca y estilo de zapato sea, anteriormente yo había pedido otra marca con el número 6 y llego como número 8. Nike sin duda se esfuerza para dar el numero que promete en sus marcas, me encantaron mis tenis y quedan hermosos"

Nike,5,Product arrived quick!
Nike,5,Product quality is good. My daughter is very happy with these shoes.
Nike,5,"Prompt delivery, beautiful shoe."
Nike,5,"Purchased a pair of these in black on black and loved them so much so I ordered these. The tongue on these is a bit more flimsy than the black ones I have but they are soft, light, and comfortable beyond belief. They feel like an extension of my own foot. I’m pretty active working out 3-4x a week with a trainer and walking or jogging 2 miles a day. They’ve held up well and with my job as a nurse doing 7-10k steps a night, my feet feel good at the end of my shift. I wear a 7.5 and have always worn 8’s because I thought I needed extra room for swelling after my shift but the 7.5 is perfect. Feels like a sock!!"
Nike,5,Purchased these for my 14 year old daughter she loves them says they are comfortable
Nike,5,Purchased these twice. Great for male or female to wear.
Nike,5,Quality is good.Comfortable.
Nike,5,"Quality was great, my daughter loved the look. Fast shipping and simple return. I felt they ran a little small simple because I bought an entire size up and they did not fit."
Nike,5,Really comfortable! I normally wear an 8 1/2 in women's and ordered a 7 in kids. Great deal!
Nike,5,"Really cute, light, and comfortable sneakers! I usually need arch supports and even though these don't seem that supportive in the arches I have no foot pain after waking for miles"
Nike,5,Really light weight and comfortable. They fit as expected.
Nike,5,Really nice shoes. Very comfortable
Nike,5,"Really nice. I'm very happy with the shoe, except, in the picture on the Amazon website, the Nike swish sign was a metallic brown. And the shoes that came in the mail had a white, nike swish sign. I love the shoes, but 2 other people in my family have the same ones. So I was really excited to find a wide shoe that was cute and unlike everyone elses."
Nike,5,Received promptly excellent fit !
Nike,5,"Recommend checking Nike sizing charts online, to ensure you order the right size. The size we ordered was a 1/2 size larger but is perfect, with a little room to grow."
Nike,5,"Roomy in the toe, a tad narrow in the arch but I believe they will give a little once worn in. My job entails a lot of standing/pivoting. These provide great support!"
Nike,5,"Runs a little small, so I had to order a half size up. But both my son and my daughter love these sneakers!"
Nike,5,"Runs large compared to my other Nikes, sent back first pair for half size smaller. However they fit my wide foot comfortably."
Nike,5,Satisfecho
Nike,5,"Se tardo más de lo esperado en llegar, pero están perfectos"
Nike,5,Second pair
Nike,5,Second pair in a bigger size. Daughter loves them
Nike,5,"Second pair of these shoes. Very comfortable for someone with a high arch. I am on my feet 8-9 hours a day, then at the gym for another hour at least. These are the first shoes that really work for me. The black and rose gold look very sharp."
Nike,5,Second pair!
Nike,5,Seems like a very nice shoe but the size was a bit smaller than expected. We initially ordered a size 9 B (M) US and then ended up exchanging it for a size 9 1/2 which fit much better.
Nike,5,Shipping was fast! Love the shoes!
Nike,5,Shoe looks better in person than the photo. Buying another pair.  White is a tricky color to own.
Nike,5,Shoes are fine
Nike,5,Shoes fit and had support.
Nike,5,"Shoes look even better then in the pictures! They came before time expected, have the red comfort insoles in the bottoms of the shoes, are EXTREMLY comfortable to walk- probably The most comfortable Nike's I've bought yet!! Shoe fabric is a bit see through on the shoe, so you can see colored socks through the  if you are wearing them, but it doesn't show too much that it would distract anyone from the white color of the actual shoe. Shoe fits more wide, so its not a suction fit on your foot. But overall, they are extremely comfortable to walk in and I am one happy customer!"
Nike,5,Size fits right.
Nike,5,Size is on point 👍🏼.
Nike,5,"Sneakers fit great. I take a size 8 in a regular shoe, but I always order an 8 1/2 in  a sneaker. Bought them for every day."
Nike,5,Sneakers look great and fit great!
Nike,5,So comfortable and love the look.
Nike,5,So comfortable and love the way they look.

Nike,5,"Soooo comfy! The first pair of shoes I have worn that were comfortable from the second I stepped into them!  Great breath ability too.  I have very wide feet, high arches and insteps. Nike shoes NEVER fit me properly because they usually have a very narrow toe box. I ordered the extra wide (2E) and they don't need to be broken in or worn a few days to feel good.  They are the best tennis shoes I think I have ever worn!!!"
Nike,5,Sooooo comfortable!! Stylish enough for the level of comfort ... I want the pure platinum ones now

Nike,5,The fit as expected and they are very comfortable. I wear them everyday and they don’t make my feet hurt. I would recommend these shoes.
Nike,5,The fit has been great from the start.  My feet ache a bit sometimes after I've been wearing them for a while (i'm on my feet a lot at work) -  and i attribute the aches to the fact that I previously wore shoes that aren't as well made as these.  They are worth every penny (and nice that i got them on sale :) )  I will definitely buy Nike in the future
Nike,5,the fit is great as expected but I love the color. Different from what I usually buy.
Nike,5,"The fit is true to size.  They are extremely comfortable.  I like that the top is soft, so there is no hard leather or stitching to press on you or rub you the wrong way.  My feet are very sensitive, so this was very important to me.  They are also extremely lightweight which I like.  It's a good looking show, and I am very happy with my purchase."
Nike,5,"The gold rose color on the black looks great, my daughter loves them."
Nike,5,The most comfortable running shoes. So I bought a second pair!
Nike,5,The most comfortable shoes I ever had. Feels like I am walking on clouds.

Nike,5,These are great shoes. They are comfortable and trendy. The price is awesome as well.
Nike,5,These are my 2nd pair of Tanjuns and they're so lightweight and comfortable. I'm very happy with this purchase and the price.
Nike,5,"These are my everyday, go-to sneakers. Lightweight and super comfortable, but the sizing is quirky. I normally wear a 7 1/2 shoe with stockings or bare feet. I always buy Nike sneakers in a size 8 to accommodate my socks, but I had to buy these sneakers in an 8 1/2 because the fabric in the toe box upper is too snug.

I bought these sneakers in the usual half size larger. Although they were fine in the store, I was never able to fully enjoy them at home. I gave away my hardly ever used Tanjuns.  If your toes need wiggle room, get these sneakers in a full size larger than your shoes."
Nike,5,"These are my favorite Nikes and I have 3 pairs. One is a women’s 7.5 and the others are boy’s 5.5. They all fit the same ( I think Nike runs small and I have wide feet, so I get a half size up). The fabric is stretchy and these are so easy to machine wash. I wear them to work often and they hold up well. I work in retail full time and I’m on my feet 8-12 hours daily. I’m also in my 40’s with heel spurs and sciatica. Good shoes are life changing!"
Nike,5,These are my favorite shoes. I don’t have any complains. They look very nice and they feel so comfortable!!!! And also they are true to size.
Nike,5,"These are my favorite shoes. They are light, and airy so your feet don’t sweat. They are super comfortable. Not great for hiking/gripping. Would definitely recommend to everyone though! I wear mine almost every day to the gym, and for long distance walking. They don’t make my feet hurt!"
Nike,5,These are my favorite sneakers EVER! I’ve repurchased these shoes many times in different colors. Great for long days of being on your feet. I feel comfortable showing up to work in these sneakers since the design is so clean. Great for a gym and work day. I love the flexible toe fabric vs. a hard toe cover.
Nike,5,These are my FAVORITE sneakers!
Nike,5,These are my favorite sneakers! I wear them all the time (not just to the gym).  They go with so much and are so stylish!
Nike,5,"These are my favorite tennis shoe! When you like a pair of shoes, you keep buying the same pair! So comfortable and fit to size. Every 6 months I buy a new pair!"
Nike,5,"These are my go-to everyday shoes. I can place an order, throw them on when I get them and go about my day and they fit perfect. Everyone asks where I get all black Nikes because they’re hard to find at times. Love these!"
Nike,5,These are my most comfortable sneakers -- I own two pairs of them!
Nike,5,These are nice shoes! I bought a second pair to look bright and white after the first pair got a little dingy from wearing them all the time. They fit great if the brand new or worn in.

Nike,5,These are the only pair of Nikes I have ever found to be comfortable. I have a little wider feet so they are perfect and comfy. I bought two pairs
Nike,5,These are the only style sneakers I can actually workout in. They are very comfortable and don’t hurt my feet during my high impact exercises.

Nike,5,these runners r awesome
Nike,5,"These shoes are amazing. I owned a different pair of Nike running shoes that always made my feet fall asleep unless I had the laces so loose they were giving me blisters. But I thought I would give Nike another shot and I absolutely love these shoes, so comfortable!!"
Nike,5,These shoes are comfortable and they fit just right. Product arrived promptly in the mail.
Nike,5,These shoes are great — I have them in 2 colors. Sleek and durable. I run/walk a lot and they lasted me maybe 8 months before the treads got too dull and I bought a new pair.
Nike,5,"These shoes are nice but I think they run a little small. I usually have a little bit of room in 8 1/2 but my toe is right at the tip, however these shoes are comfortable."

I wear a 10-11 depending on brand, ordered a 10.5 and they fit perfectly! Have average width feet."
Nike,5,These shoes are soooooo comfortable.  As soon as I put them on they were very light weight and very comfortable to walk in.  Highly recommend.
Nike,5,These shoes are super comfortable and stylish. I bought them for walking exercise. The fit is great and very comfortable for daily walks.
Nike,5,"These shoes are super light and comfortable.  The mesh is breathable and keeps my feet cool while the padding cushions and supports my feet.  Makes them good for walking and light workouts.  Don't know about running, as that's not what I got them for.  Might not be enough support for high impact activities, but for me, they work great."
Nike,5,these shoes are very very comfortable and is suitable for almost any outfit
Nike,5,These shoes came through I work for amazon and on my feet for at least 11 hours a day.  Feet feel so much better with these shoes.  But I also wear compression socks. The combination is magic.  I love these shoes.  And they don’t look to bad either being that I’m a shoe fan. Forget looking cute. My feet where killing me.  I wanted to quit on many occasions cause the pain was so bad. But now I’m walking on clouds. Definitely a must buy.
Nike,5,"These shoes can be worn all day long and my feet never get tired. Also my feet never get hot like other shoes, they breathe very well"
Nike,5,"These shoes come about a 1/2 size smaller than advertised.  That out of the way, probably the most comfortable hot weather shoes I've ever experienced. They came up number one on a google search for ""best shoes for being on your feet walking around all day"" ...google was accurate"
Nike,5,These shoes fit just right.. I bought some Orthotics just to add a little bit more support. Perfect these are now my go shoes for walking & running..

If you are looking for comfort when standing, I would recommend.  They have worked for me.  I've been wearing since November."

Nike,5,"This is my second pair of that exact same color. The first pair lasted me about a year or two with heavy everyday use. It's a classic look and pairs well with many outfits. The shoes are comfortable to walk in and are super lightweight.

I also have this same style of Nike's in white and another in grey. I'm a big fan."
Nike,5,This is my second pair of these. I love them so much I bought a backup pair.

The white on white is super minimalist which allows it to be super versatile. I’m planning on bring only one other pair of shoes."

Nike,5,Was to small
Nike,5,"We love our Nike shoes!  My daughter wears a 12 shoe, so we have a difficult time finding her size in stores.  Was happy to find them on Amazon.  The shoe fits as expected and they are very comfortable and we love Nike's quality."
Nike,5,"Well I am usually not a fan of athletic shoes because I feel my feet ‘can’t breathe’. I live in Florida and am used to wearing sandals however I joined the gym and closed toe shoes are a requirement.  My granddaughter suggested I buy these shoes because of the mesh uppers, being lightweight and offering good support. Well she was right on all accounts.  They are so comfortable and my foot does not feel restricted.  I ordered my son a black pair, however the have not arrived yet. He is usually a Reebok man however I bet he will love these shoes,"
Nike,5,were a little  high after shipping and tax
Nike,5,Wife loves them
Nike,5,"Wife's b-day present.  She loves them!  They are very thin, so not awesome in nebraska winter, but great running shoe."

UA,5,100% would order again!
UA,5,A good shoe for the value!  A little snug on my right foot but probably my foot!!!
UA,5,Absolutely in love with these. Fit is perfect. So comfortable and cute. I want to wear them all day. Definitely recommend. I want to buy a million pairs.
UA,5,Absolutely love everything about these shoes. Comfortable and love the colors!
UA,5,Absolutely love them!
UA,5,Absolutely love them. Im a waitress and on my feet non stop for 8 hours and at the end of the night my feet are not throbbing like other shoes. Super comfy and light and great for walking and being on your feet for hours. Highly recommend
UA,5,"Absolutely love these for walking! The style is so comfortable and supportive. My only call out is to read the color you are buying as the color description does not match the picture. Was expecting on color and got another, but still kept!"
UA,5,"Absolutely love these for walking! They do run like a 1/4 size too small. But I always order a half size up, so I still have room. Super supportive for high arches. White probably isn’t the best color choice for a mom with three kiddos, but they wipe clean pretty easily."
UA,5,"Absolutely love these shoes! Form to my feet and provide great support! Can’t wait to break them in!
Will order again!
Great for running, HITT cardio and stair climber."
UA,5,Absolutely love these shoes!! I want to buy more in different colors
UA,5,Absolutely love these shoes!! They look fantastic and fit great!! So comfortable! Exactly what I was looking for!!
UA,5,Absolutely love these shoes. Went with a half a size bigger than my last under armor and feel as if I could have stayed my normal size. They literally feel like pillows on my feet.
UA,5,"Absolutely love these sneakers - so comfortable! Worked out the first time I wore them, didn’t have to wait to break them in at all! I swear they make my feel look smaller - I’m only a size 8 but still lol"
UA,5,Absolutely love these! Fit great and were comfortable to wear all day at work. Color I ordered was the black with white accents and were correct when they arrived.
UA,5,"Absolutely thrilled with this shoe! a TRUE ""wide"" shoe. I have bought so many pair that claimed ""wide"" sizes and could not wear them. These are a real fit!"
UA,5,After several tries for shoes for my daughter we finally came across these. She loves them. She describes them as extra comfortable. She is super picky about shoes. I’m not sure she’s taken them off yet.
UA,5,After trying multiple shoes online since stores are closed due to covid... These were a rare find.  Unbelievably comfortable and firm but flexible.  I use Asics and now these.  Looking forward to putting on miles.
UA,5,Always have to go a size up but otherwise a GREAT workout shoe.
UA,5,"Always like under armour
They are comfortable for me"
UA,5,Am in love! The support is amazing.  I'm on my feet 9 hours out of a day. And need the right shoes to make sure I make through the day without issues.  They look good.  They came a day early.
UA,5,"Amazing shoes, i will buy it again"
UA,5,As pictured
UA,5,Awesome fit and comfortable shoe.
UA,5,Awesome fit for my post bunion surgery foot. Back of heel runs some but will loosen up I’m sure.
UA,5,Awesome shoes true to size and comfortable
UA,5,Awesome sneaker very comfy. Light weight. Order a size up than usual. I’m a size 9 when I wear under amour sneakers. But this sneaker was to small. Had to return and order a 9.5.
UA,5,Awesome sneakers
UA,5,beautiful.I love it
UA,5,"Because of Covid, I'd purchased much needed walking shoes online.  When they didn't fit, or hurt my feet I went back to Under Armour because I knew they'd be just what I wanted - because they'd always been just what I needed."
UA,5,Bellos
UA,5,Best brand of shoes I have ever owned.
UA,5,Best product best price!!!
UA,5,Best shoe ever. Perfect for work as I'm on my feet 10 to 12 hours a day. I want a pair in every color.
UA,5,"Best sneaker I’ve ever had, made well and fits perfect. Love these and probably will buy the same in another color...."
UA,5,Best support. Favorite sneakers.
UA,5,Best tennis shoes I’ve ever purchased!!!!
UA,5,"Birthday gift for the wife, she loves them"
UA,5,Bonitos y exelnt calidad
UA,5,"Bought a 7 wide. I love them. I appreciate under armour for making Wide shoes (their pretty difficult to find now a days) the sizing was right, the comfort is there, and the fit wasn’t to tight. I’m a runner and occasional dog trainer so I need a good pair of shoes for daily activities. These are perfect and reasonable priced. The same shoes was 84$ in the actual under armour store so I’m glad I snagged them on Amazon! If your in between sizes though go for the larger size. I’m usually a 6.5 or 7, just depends on the brand. I got a 7 and they fit perfectly."
UA,5,"Bought as a gift.
Good quality. As expected."
UA,5,"Bought these as a 2nd pair to wear out. Soon as I put the shoes on,  they were so compfy and the added full çushion felt great.  I usually wear orthotics in all my shoes,  but I wore them today alone, driving and walked thru 3 stores in a row. Came home and my feet didn't hurt at all.  Love them for comfort and support."
UA,5,"Bought these because my current shoes I'd had for 3 months were still so uncomfortable. I'm a nurse and running around all day with shoes that hurt my feet only added to fatigue.
First day I wore these... game changer. They fit fantastic, didn't hurt my feet. I can work multiple shifts in a row without pain or fatigue in my feet."
UA,5,Bought these for my wife and she loves them. We have started running everyday and her old shoes had little to no support but she said these work great and are comfortable. She also said they fit well.
UA,5,Bought these for while I recover from my ankle fracture surgery. I take these to physical therapy sessions and my bulky ankle brace fits fine in these which is a plus. I bought my normal size 6.5 and they fit perfect for someone who now has one swollen ankle compared to the other.
UA,5,Bought these for work and so far I have not been disappointed!
UA,5,Bought these shoes for my very active wife and she loves them! They are true to size and very comfortable for working out and everyday wear!
UA,5,"Bought these to wear on walks outside and will likely use them as work shoes as well. They are very comfortable and light weight, overall I would recommend these shoes!"

UA,5,"Feel great, great price, runs well"
UA,5,Finally a shoe that works for me. I have had a lot of trouble with shoes giving me blisters burning the bottom of my feet because I'm on my feet a lot. This you has been a lifesaver. Also on here it's cheaper than the stores I usually get them for $80 at stores. I use these for hiking I use these just for a regular day I use these all the time they are good for everything in my opinion. I ignored this brand for so long because I thought I was supposed to have Nike shoes or something because of the brand and the reputation but the whole time I should have been wearing Under Armour shoes and trust me I went through probably every kind of Nikes.
UA,5,Finally found some good looking shoes that are also comfortable!
UA,5,Fine
UA,5,First time I wore this shoes went for a 4.8 mile walk ..... love them so comfy then a repeat next day.... same then off to Cabo for a week and wore them while walking to town and shopping.  Great pair of shoes.

UA,5,Fit great. Just not as comfortable after standing for a few hours. I work in a warehouse and on my feet for 8 or more hours at a time and constantly moving and my feet hurt after a couple hours of it. So for a short time these are great shoes no problems wity the heals or anything else just the padding isn't enough! But so much better than my last shoes!
UA,5,"Fit like a glove. Comfortable and fit for support. Highly recommend it. I haven’t worked out with it yet, but I did some HITT exercises to test it out for 10mins. AMAZING!"
UA,5,FIT LIKE THEY SHOULD. THEY RUB-HURT MY ANKLES A BIT AT FIRST UNTIL SHOE WAS WORN IN.
UA,5,Fit nicely light weighted
UA,5,Fit perfect
UA,5,Fit perfect! Lots of support! Good quality!
UA,5,Fit perfectly but should have gone a size up but with my small feet it fits from heel to toe the heel part is comfy. It came a day early then it said it would. Which I good because I brought them for work because I’m up on my feet all day

UA,5,"flexible material, breathable mesh, true to size"
UA,5,For my first pair of under armours not too bad !
UA,5,"For starters I’m currently 7 months pregnant and work as a dental assistant where I’m on my feet for 8-10 hours a day. I previously had Fila brand nurse’s shoes but a couple months ago I noticed my feet were incredibly sore at the end of the day. I knew being pregnant probably had something to do with it but regardless it was time for new work shoes. I purchased these after seeing all the good reviews. I’m so impressed. The rest of my body may be sore at the end of my shift from being pregnant but not my feet! If they work this well while pregnant I know that they will when I’m no longer pregnant as well. I can’t speak to how they are for running- but if you work in healthcare , or any other profession that requires you to be on your feet all day I definitely recommend these sneakers."
UA,5,"For walking exercise
Very comfortable"
UA,5,For work.
UA,5,Gift for my granddaughter... she loves them
UA,5,"Go up 1/2 to 1 full size. This shows were purchased for working out, but were too small. I wear a 7.5, and my toe touched the very front of the shoe. A bit narrow as well."

UA,5,"Great support and they are super cute!  They were squeaky for the first few minutes of wear (like super squeaky) that I thought I was going to have to return them, but then the squeak went away.  Love the fit - great walking or running shoe (though I do not run, but they feel sturdy enough)."
UA,5,"Great support!  I have some foot issues but these shoes are fantastic.  They support without crushing, soft feel , hardly know you are wearing them"
UA,5,Great value for money. it fits perfectly
UA,5,"Great value, well constructed, light but well-shaped. Sole adheres to the floor during workouts. Fit perfect."
UA,5,Had a great experience as it was my first time buying shoes on Amazon. I was hesitant because wasn't sure if they would fit. I am a size 9 so ordered that and they fit perfectly. The colors are nice too. I would order them again.
UA,5,Had in regular size was to tight but wide with is perfect. Love this shoe im on my feet for 12hr days and they don't hurt after. :)
UA,5,Had to go up a size as sneakers and under armour always seem to run small. Good thing cause the bigger size fits perfect. Very comfy and great support .
UA,5,Have a pair for walking the dog and a pair for wearing when I go out.
UA,5,"Hi, I usually wear a size 8.5 for most brands, except adidas I wear a size 8. This shoes in size 8.5 fit just right. Super comfy, well cushioned.  They look sturdy and of good quality. Very pleased with them."
UA,5,I “always” wear a 9.5 shoe but in this stle it was too small. Once I got size 10 I can say these shoes are awesome. Great fit/ great support.
UA,5,I absolutely love these shoes when you select a wide shoe you actually get it. They are so comfortable.
UA,5,I absolutely love these shoes!  They are very comfortable.
UA,5,I absolutely love these shoes! These are my first pair of Under Armour sneakers and they fit absolutely amazing! I am a 9 and these fit perfect. I will be buying another pair soon. Love thee for working out as well as daily activities.
UA,5,I absolutely love these shoes!!! They’re so comfortable and my feet don’t hurt at the end of a 12 hour work day!
UA,5,"I absolutely love Under Armour shoes. This pair does NOT disappoint. They are so comfortable and really take pressure off my knees and lower back after walking. Under Armour shoes do run slightly smaller, so I recommend going up half a size. These are my 3rd paid of UA shoes and I’ve always gone a half size up, and they’ve fit perfectly."
UA,5,I already had a black pair that I love and wanted another color option. The sizes run a little wide. But that is perfect for my feet because I have bunions so they work out perfectly.
UA,5,"I am a die hard skechers fan, but the shoes I love they discontinued!
A friend recommended these- I put in my size and they recommended I get a wide. I did and they fit great!!
I am used to memory foam,  so that is a bit of an adjustment since these don't have any.
I already ordered a second pair.
Love them"
UA,5,I am a tech so on my 12 hours and the shoes are very comfortable and they look great and the price was right
UA,5,I am on my feet at work 10-15 hrs and these shoes are very comfortable every hour ....
UA,5,I am on my feet for 8-9 hours a day and these shoes are great--very comfortable :-)
UA,5,I am so glad I got these. I forgotten how great good shoes feel on your feet!!!
UA,5,"I am terribly flat footed and constantly have knee and ankle pain. I currently had ankle pain until I put these shoes on and it instantly went away! I will definitely be ordering another pair for work. Also, I normally wear an 11.5-12 women’s and a size 12 fits perfectly! And I have a very wide foot! If anything changes between now and my workout tomorrow I will update my review."
UA,5,I bought it for my daughter for walking and she enjoyed the comfort of wearing it.
UA,5,"I bought the UA Asser 8s in Halo Gray 101 White after owning a pair of UA Asserts 7s in Steel. I bought my regular shoe size. The toe box is roomy and the fit is perfect for my feet. These shoes are comfortable but will require a few days break-in to mold to my feet. The fit feels different from my 7s but that may be from enjoying and wearing my 7s so much. I like the lighter color for the hotter summer temps coming soon. Because of the lighter color, I did spray rain and stain guard on them for protection.  I use these shoes for long walks, jogging, biking, and casual wear. I appreciate being able to use my Amazon reward points to discount the cost as well as the timely shipping. I am happy with my purchase."
UA,5,"I bought these as a gift, she loves them."
UA,5,I bought these because I have had a pair that was the exact same for 3 years and they are so far holding up great😁
UA,5,"I bought these because I needed something to start working out in after our daughter is born and also a comfortable pair of shoes to wear 9 months pregnant until the baby comes, my feet haven't been this happy in a while. They stay very clean and are a great quality :)"
UA,5,I bought these for a hiking trip in Sedona and was not disappointed! I averaged 15-20 miles a day and my feet felt great. I am a nurse and everyone at work wears them so I thought I would try them. I stand for long periods and work 12 hour shifts and they are great. They do run a little tight.
UA,5,I bought these for work but once I tried them on they were so cute 😍  I'm keeping them as my everyday shoe! I read the reviews and said runs small I wear a 10 and I ordered 10.5 and fits perfectly!
UA,5,"I bought these for work, as I’m on my feet for 8hrs. I honestly wear them for walks, jogging, & basically everywhere. They’re super comfortable & have decent arch support. I don’t have pain in my feet after work like I normally do with pretty much any other pair of shoes. My feet are also between regular width & wide width, and these shoes couldn’t fit more perfectly. I will definitely be buying these again in the future."
UA,5,"I bought these for work. I am on my feet for 12 hours and have Plantar  Fasciitis, these shoes are comfortable at the end of my shift, no extra inserts needed!"
UA,5,"I bought these in wide and they were actually wide enough for me! Seems like a sturdy shoe, happy with my purchase."
UA,5,"I bought these shoes because I wanted a great pair for working out.  Every since I got them, they have been perfect for balance and exercising!  Great for running too!  The shoes fit my feet perfectly and are so comfortable and I am going to buy an extra pair"
UA,5,"I bought these to wear to a group fitness class (sort of a scaled down CrossFit).  They are light-weight and fits like a glove.  Comfortable, offers good arch support.  Overall a great shoe and the price sweetens the deal.  Glad I tried them."
UA,5,I bought these to work out in and have had trouble finding a good fit. These are perfect!
UA,5,"I bought this for Amazon Prime Day, and I love them for the price they were. They are a bit snug but super comfy & have great support. Normally I am a size 8-9 depending on the shoe. Based on previous reviews, I decided to get 8.5! I have worked out in them a few times- squeaky at first but now they are broken in. Definitely going to order again!"
UA,5,"I can’t say enough good things about these shoes! I’ve tried so many different and more expensive brands so I was a little nervous ordering online. I knew I could easily return them if I wasn’t happy with them. These shoes are so comfortable, fit great and are stylish! I wear them for running errands and also power walking. My feet are happy!"
UA,5,"I can’t tell you enough of how good this shoes are! Amazing support, very comfortable. Helps my aching feet to feel better!"
UA,5,"I can't say enough about under Armour tennis. They for amazing, they are instant comfort right from the second you put them on, no ""break in"" best tennies I've ever had. Won't buy any other."
UA,5,"I compared these to my Brooks Ghost 10 running shoes that I use for walking. They were over three times as expensive as these shoes and I can’t see any reason why as they don’t seem three times as good. That said, the Brooks Ghost shoes are extremely comfortable.
These shoes have the exact same, or almost the exact same, measurements as the Brooks’.
The black with white logo was sleek and attractive.
They are super comfy, though they don’t provide a ton of support. Neither do the Brooks’.
If after wearing these for a while I have a different opinion I will be sure to update the review."
UA,5,"I didn’t buy these shoes through Amazon but bought them from a sports store a couple of weeks ago. They’re are the most comfortable light weight shoes I have ever owned, just as good as my New Balance. I walk in them every day and it has good arch support as I suffer from plantar fasciitis. I normally wear 6.5 but had to size up to a 7 since they run at least half a size small. So far so good!"
UA,5,i didnt even have to break them in! great shoes. fits perfectly
UA,5,I do a lot of walking for my job and these shoes are very comfortable.
UA,5,I don’t have a wide foot but I prefer a roomy toe box.  I can usually wear 8 or 8.5.  I ordered 8.5W And they fit perfect.  Many complements.  Good value and style.
UA,5,I don’t know but this shoes are amazing. They feel so light when I walk with them and I’m in love with the black on black color😍
UA,5,I don't normally write reviews but I feel the need to now.  These shoes are very comfortable!  I'm on my feet 10+ hours a day and these shoes are amazing!!  I no longer have pain in my feet!  They do run small and I had to buy a size bigger than normal.  Definitely worth every penny!!!
UA,5,"I expected them to not fit exactly right but I was surprised, they fit perfectly 🙏"
UA,5,"I got the pitch gray, it’s ever so slightly lighter in color in person which I really like! I religiously wear an 8 in shoes and these are a tad snug. Would definitely not wear them running (I would get a half size up if that’s what you’re looking for). I got them just as comfy cute sneakers so I’m happy with my purchase!"
UA,5,I got these for my mom as gift and she absolutely loves them! The fit is true to size and she said they gave her the perfect amount of support. She has already done a few short runs with them but also likes wearing them around town.
UA,5,"I got these for the intent of providing more support to my feet, and they did just that. They are comfortable for walking, running and being on your feet all day."
UA,5,I got these shoes for work because I’m on my feet a lot and more often than not I have to move quickly. These are great! No pain in my feet at the end of the day and a lot less back pain as well.
UA,5,I got these shoes specifically for for my job as a CNA since I don’t like nursing shoes. This shoes are amazing. They have a really good support and are very comfortable to wear while on your feet for 12+hours at a time! I’m really glad I made this purchase.
UA,5,I got these to replace a pair of shoes that were twice as expensive but didn't fit right and so I returned them.  These are so much better at half the cost with twice the comfort and support.
UA,5,"I had always been attracted to these black and white running shoes and when I received a gift card, I decided to finally make a purchase. I ordered late Saturday and the item was shipped the next day, on Sunday. I don't have Prime, so I was pleasantly surprised when the shoes arrived on Tuesday. I read some reviews about the sizing and thought maybe I should size up. But, I'm glad I didn't. I was a size 10 in my 20s and 30s, and I knew my feet got a little bigger over the years, so I just ordered my regular size of 11. They fit as expected. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
UA,5,"I had purchased a pair in gray and loved them. So, of course had to have another color. These are very comfortable and they look amazing."
UA,5,"I had to go down a 1/2 size, super comfortable and supportive"
UA,5,I had to order a larger size and will give my daughter the size 8.  Love the fit and the look
UA,5,"I hate shopping for shoes, but this pair has been the best pair of shoes I have owned in years."
UA,5,I have 2 pair and probably should get more. They fit perfectly. Only downside is I don't get that aahh feeling when I take my shoes off because they are already soooo comfortable. I'm a personal trainer and I walk alot  so I'm in these shoes all day.
UA,5,"I have a hard time finding comfortable shoes for my job. I work on cement floors 8 to 12 hrs a day. I was very skeptical because I have purchased shoes that were much more expensive and even went as far as getting orthotic insoles for my shoes. Nothing helped. So far after a week of wearing these shoes, my feet don't hurt after work. I don't come home and immediately rip my shoes off. As a matter of fact, I found I have left them on when I got home."
UA,5,I have a leg length discrepancy and plantar fasciitis in both feet. These shoes fit comfortably with my orthotic and offer great support. I also have a wide toe box with narrow heels (women's size 11). These are comfortable in the toe box and there's miraculously no slippage in my heel.
UA,5,"I have a lot of foot pain and I’m on my feet for hours at a time cleaning houses.  I read the review from the nurse and decided to try them. I’m so glad I did! I wear a size 10 and they fit perfect. I have not jogged in them yet, but for normal walking around, they are very comfortable! These are my first Under Armour shoes, and I am in love!"
UA,5,"I have a neurosensory condition, and these are the most comfortable athletic shoes I’ve ever worn. Well-made and attractive looking."
UA,5,"I have always been a supporter of Nike, but I support the United States Constitution and the American Flag, and therefore, those who don't, I could not longer endorse or support, that would be Nike!!!  So I started testing different products and found Under Armour. What a find!! Great Shoe!! Great Price!!  I also bought my husband a pair, my two grandsons.. etc.. I have long supported their line of clothing!!  Under Armour, your rock!!"
UA,5,"I have gotten many compliments on my new running shoes.  Even my own son complimented me on my new running shoes, ""Very Athletic, Mom!"".  They are comfortable and light weight.  Exactly what I was looking for.  The price on Amazon was about $50.00 less than at most retail stores.  Great Quality and Authentic Under Armor running shoes."
UA,5,I have had these shoes for almost a year now and they are phenomenal! They fit they are comfortable and you absolutely wouldn’t guess they are a year old. I wear them every day. I stand 8.5 hours a day at minimum. Wonderful product 10 out of 10.
UA,5,I have had these shoes for just over a year and I love them they are extremely comfortable and lightweight the support is perfect I have flat feet so arch support is usually uncomfortable but these are amazing
UA,5,I have MS and I have regular falls with damage to both my achilles tendons. When I put these shoes on they support my feet and ankles so well. My pain is kept at a minimum because of these shoes.
UA,5,"I have significant arthritis in my feel.  From the moment I put these shoes on, I knew they were going to be great for me.  Excellent fit and support yet stretchy enough to lessen downward pressure the top of my feet where  the arthritis is most apparent.  They also are very nice looking besides being well designed.  I can wear these shoes all day and keep moving which was not possible with any other pair for the last several years.  I now have two pairs and will undoubtably by a third ."
UA,5,"I have tried over a dozen athletic shoes and none have been comfortable from day one like these!  I wear them all the time and highly recommend them for working out, walking, and vacation!"
UA,5,I have wide feet and these fit perfect and didn't have to break in
UA,5,I haven’t worn them to work yet but they feel good walking around the house right away and they look good. Will update if needed :)
UA,5,I just received mine about a week ago and love them so much! They are great for working out. Very comfortable and also a great price!
UA,5,"I just received my sneackers and felt in love from the very beginning. Fit perfectly (6 1/6) and they feel really soft and confortable.

UA,5,"I like how comfortable they are and that they don't hurt your feet, even after you've been on your feet all day."

UA,5,I liked them so I order them
UA,5,I liked them so much I ordered another pair 😊
UA,5,I love it!! Excellent product
UA,5,I love it. Comfortable. But not the inside is too thin and not supporting the arches. It will be fine if adding the arch support insole.

UA,5,I love love love these sneakers they are comfortable not to wide or to narrow perfect fit. Very comfortable will diff buy another pair!!!

UA,5,"I love the color, nothing to hate."
UA,5,"I love the colors, that's what I was drawn too. I've never wore under armour before and they fit and feel very good!"
UA,5,"I love the look of this shoe. I put on the first day and wore to work for 8 hours. No break in period, they were fine all day. Usually sport shoes are too hot for me but these were fine. I normally wear a 9 and these are 9’s..."
UA,5,I love them

UA,5,"I love these shoes! I will say first off, they do run small. I usually wear 3.5 in big kids and 5 is often too big for my lil feet. I bought 5 if I needed to wear thicker socks.
Instead I bought a little thinner sock and they fit perfect. I am on my feet quit a bit got a part time job and these are like walking on air! Definitely would buy these again!"
UA,5,"I love these shoes! So comfortable! I could walk forever in them! The only problem is one that has been mentioned in many other reviews...they run small. I always wear a 6, but had to send them back and get 6 1/2. I’m glad I did!!! I absolutely love them!"
UA,5,"I love these shoes! They are super comfortable and for perfectly. I am not a runner, I got them for weekends."
UA,5,"I love these shoes! They feel good and they look good. They don't look clunky , more streamlined. I can't stand ugly, clunky looking shoes and I love the color. Going to order another pair before they quit making them."
UA,5,I love these shoes! Very confortable
UA,5,I love these shoes!!! They fit perfect& very comfortable!!!
UA,5,"I LOVE These shoes, but I had to return them to go a half a size up. Unfortunately this color is no longer available. But If they have your size I would definitely encourage you to buy them!"
UA,5,"I love these shoes, great fit and breathable."
UA,5,I love these shoes.  They fit perfect to my size and provide the best foot support.  I stand all day and these leave my feet feeling great all day.
UA,5,I love these shoes. I actually bought a half size smaller then I typically wear and they fit perfect. They are very comfortable and perfect for all the walking I do. I would definitely buy another pair.
UA,5,"I love these shoes. I originally ordered my usual size 10, but had to return it for a size 10.5. First time wearing UA shoes, and yes they run small. They are a bit narrow at first twoo but after about a week or so, they broke in and fit great now. i U se them every day for my evening jogs, or just running errands around town. Love them!"
UA,5,"I LOVE these shoes. I work at Chick Fil A so I’m on my feet almost 24/7 and really needed some shoes that could withstand that. In the past other shoe brands I’ve tried have worn out super fast and caused me lots of foot/back pain but these are by far the best pair I’ve had yet. They have great arch support, dry very quickly even when I’ve gotten them soaking wet, and overall are super comfy. The only downside I’d have is that they were slightly smaller than expected so I’d just size up one size. But overall a great product!!"
UA,5,"I love these shoes. The fit is true to size. They are very comfortable. They have fantastic support. I do a lot of HIIT and with all the jumping and lateral moves the support these shoes have is perfect.
They are also nice and light. I have already bought another pair!!"
UA,5,"I love these shoes. They are really comfortable. As in, 5 stars comfortable. I liked these shoes so much I bought them in two different colors. I wouldn't run in them personally but for walking and/or cross training exercises, I think these shoes do the trick. I'm a fan."
UA,5,I love these shoes...they are very comfortable
UA,5,I love these shoes.they are perfect.
UA,5,I love these shows. So comfortable and provide the support I need!
UA,5,I love these sneakers good for my 12 hrs shift
UA,5,I LOVE these sneakers! I waited and waited to order but so glad I did! Fit perfect! Great support. Went for 2 mile hike today with my dog and were so comfortable.
UA,5,"I love these sneakers! My mom asked me to buy her specific Under Armour sneakers during Black Friday last year and I ordered them (not from Amazon). When I purchased these sneakers for myself from Amazon, I didn't realize they were the same exact sneakers that she praised for months. We have matching sneakers now and we both love them."
UA,5,I love these sneakers! They are so comfortable and a great price! I’ll definitely buy again!
UA,5,I love these sneakers. I am a heavier person and have found that UnderArmour sneakers provide good ankle support and arch. I usually wear a 8 1/2 but after reading some reviews I ended up ordering a 9 and they fit my foot perfect. They are very roomy in the toe area. I'm definitely going to order another pair.
UA,5,"I love these!  I rarely write reviews, but these are extra comfy for walking, and although I normally wear an average width shoe, I was pleasantly surprised that they feel a tad wider in the toe area than most shoes, causing less friction where corns often develop near the pinky toe - bonus!  I bought a 2nd pair!"
UA,5,"I love these! I'm an Asics girl by heart, but I loved how sturdy the ankle area felt. It's a real quality shoe."
UA,5,I love these! They go with all of my gym garb. Comfy and stylish. Under Armour is my all time favorite.
UA,5,"I Love these!! The fit is spot on, soles are great, and the cushioning is spot on. I would recommend Under Armor shoes to anyone!!"
UA,5,I love these. I have a bad back and these shoes support it well. They are comfortable for working on my feet all day and working out in them at the gym.  They are super squishy soft on the inside but they are still very comfortable
UA,5,I love this brand fits great every time
UA,5,"I love this shoes, they are extremely comfortable. Just make sure you get half size bigger."
UA,5,"I love this sneaker! I ordered all black, because I wasn’t sure how I felt about the bulky sole- the look good and feel great! I read a lot of reviews and most of them had great feedback, so I decided to get them, hands-down the best sneaker purchase I’ve made online! I love them so much I even Ordered the black with the white soles!"
UA,5,I love under armor gym shoes. My last ones were just giving out after about two years of heavy use. These are nice and seem to be well made shoes so far. I normally order a size 9 but because of reviews I ordered a half size up and they’re too big. I’ll be returning to re-order my size.
UA,5,"I love UNDER ARMOUR and by far this sneaker is cutest I owned.
Love this dark Grey. I honestly think it matching with anything.
It fits perfectly and I it felt really comfortable.
I am not a fan of these cloth soft material sneaker now making so I am pleased that this material is exactly what I wanted."
UA,5,"I love Under Armour shoes! This is my second pair. I wore my first pair every day until the front of the shoe got caught in a low filing cabinet and began to peel back. I continued to wear them until I found these shoes which are pretty similar to what I originally had. Except, these are much more comfortable for my wide feet. I normally wear a size 8 however my feet are wide so I size up to 8.5. Under Armour shoes run a little small so I got them in a 9 wide and I am so amazed at how perfect they are for me. They are not bulky like my Nike's running shoes. These are very light weight and comfortable, just enough padding for my tendonitis."
UA,5,I loved extra padding a great benefit for my daily walks
UA,5,I loved the 1st pair I got. I am on my feet a lot because I clean house. I bought another pair in a different color and I will probably get another color because I love them so much.
UA,5,I loved the shoe but was a little too big but want to buy a half size smaller when they become available again.
UA,5,I loved the shoe when I walked up the hill earlier a very Steep Hill earlier I realized that it was very good for my ankles
UA,5,I loved them but. They run small. I just ordered a bigger size!!
UA,5,I needed new running shoes and these work great for running and working out at the gym. They are so comfortable.
UA,5,"I needed new sneakers for walking/jogging around my neighborhood, which has hills. These sneakers are fantastic! They are soft, pliable but still offer support. You barely feel like you have sneakers on. I had bought another well known name brand which immediately caused shin splints from being too rigid and blisters. These were so comfortable and I did not have any of those issues. Thinking about buying another pair If these in a different color now."
UA,5,I needed new work shoes(I work at a pharmacy and I stand all day) these are great for my wide and FLAT feet! They give my feet enough room and support so that they don’t hurt after work! I’d buy again 👍🏼
UA,5,"I normally wear a 8.5 in size but they were sold out of that size. I read on a comment that they ran small so I tried my luck with a size 9 and am so glad I did, they fit perfect!"
UA,5,I only have one thing to say about these shoes...LOVE!!! They are soooo comfortable. They're great walking shoes and just everyday wear with my jeans kinda day. I would definitely recommend them.
UA,5,"I ordered a wide size in this shoe and they actually fit great (I have a hard time finding comfortable shoes that fit since I have bunions).  They are a little warm, but very comfortable - especially for the price!"
UA,5,I purchased these for daily aerobic and elliptical workouts. They are very comfortable. These are one of the few shoes I have found that don't cause pain in my toes (or anywhere else). I did size up a half size from everyday shoes.  I would definitely recommend them.
UA,5,I purchased these shoes for working out on the treadmill for walking and running. They are so comfortable and they are supporting my feet very well
UA,5,"I put about 6 miles a day on these.  Fit is great - I have a wider foot, but went with standard width and they feel and fit great.  I've had them for about 3 months and they have held up nicely so far."
UA,5,I put these on and wore all day.  I did order 1/2 size smaller (ordered 5.5 instead of 6) because the review I read said they run big.  So glad I did.  Would order these again.
UA,5,"I rarely buy shoes online as I am always worried they won't fit correctly, but these shoes fit perfectly. I wear these to work where I have to be on my feet for 8+ hours every day and they have given me great support."
UA,5,"I read the reviews and several reviews said these run small, so I ordered up a 1/2 size to an 8.  These are great running  shoes,  good support and comfortable."
UA,5,I really enjoy these as my regular everyday shoes.  The cushion in them gives nice bounce back and a lot of times forget I have them on they are that comfortable.
UA,5,I really like these shoes.
UA,5,"I really like these shoes. I've worn them for about 7 workouts now and they are holding up well for me. I usually only run a mile or two at a time. I do a lot of HIIT workouts. They work well for what I do. I'm unsure how they would hold up for more intense runners, but they seem to be good quality."
UA,5,I really like these! My feet are wide so they fit very comfortably. I wear them for running/walking everyday.
UA,5,"I really love these shoes. I like the look and the feel of them. I walk, run, HIIT and strength train with them. So they are good for whatever your exercise needs are. I’m really happy they come in a wide option, if needed. My feet are wide and it’s hard to find a good shoe to exercise with that won’t cause my feet problems from being too narrow."
UA,5,"I really love these Under Armour sneakers.
The most comfy shoes I have ever ordered & I was a little nervous not trying them on before purchasing. No worries I ordered my regular size the are a perfect fit. Stylish, sturdy, & the most comfy! I have already washed them they still look new!"
UA,5,I recently bought my first pair of Under Armour sneakers and within a week I purchased a 2nd pair. The sneakers are supportive without being too tight. They are light and very comfortable. I'd highly recommend these sneakers.
UA,5,"I run on a sand road. These shoes are perfect for my needs. Good traction, light, and fit good. I like a wide toe box, these fit perfect!"
UA,5,"I stand for hours, thus far, the Under Amour shoes have provided support for my back and knees. I originally ordered 6.5, but the fit was too small. I received the new pair within 72 hours after requesting for an exchange. No complaints!"
UA,5,"I struggle to find a good wide shoe, second to that- finding one of good support.  These shoes a perfect 👌 ! Not bulky, they are casual.  Personally I wear them on my everyday run-arounds, they would be great for exercise. Best sneaker I have bought."
UA,5,I think these shoes at first fit well however if you wash them they become WAY TOO small and kill your feet. I just bought Adidas that are WAY too big and I don't care because my toes are happy.  I can't stand foot pain.
UA,5,I use it for working out. It's fit for me but it so exactly for my size.
UA,5,I use them for work I’m on my feet all day and they have great support
UA,5,"I use them to walk around my college campus and never had an issue with them. Super comfortable and fits well, would recommend for anyone looking for a nice pair of sneakers to use :)"
UA,5,I use these for work because I'm on my feet all day.
UA,5,"I use these for working out and a separate pair for work I am on my feet all day, they are so comfortable, love them will be buying again😊"
UA,5,I use these shoes for running they are very comfortable and have great support!
UA,5,"I use these shoes for walking. They’re light, yet supportive."
UA,5,I use this for work which has me always on my feet for 8 hrs and find it comfortable. Highly recommend.
UA,5,I used these sneakers for jogging at a trail. Comfortable. Support I needed.
UA,5,I used to HATE walking until I bought these shoes! They are fantastic and so supportive. They are the best pair I've ever owned and they are over a year old and I can still wear them. They fit better than advertised. I was expecting them to be too small but I was delighted to find out they fit perfect even on days were my feet swell from being on them all day and these shoes actually keep my feet from killing me at the end of the day!
UA,5,I usually take a size 6.5 but for comfort purposes for this shoe a whole size up would probably work better
UA,5,"I very pleased with the fit, the breath ability of these sneakers and very light for work outs and walking, comfort level was better than I expected"
UA,5,"I waited to review these, so my shoes are a little dirty - pardon that! These shoes are an absolute game-changer. There’s a saying “Invest in things that separate you from the ground” meaning your bed, tires, and shoes!

My coworkers go on a five mile walk during lunch, and before these, my feet would always be in agony. I’ve now walked 26 miles in and around Boston, walked uncountable miles on all terrains, and these have held up perfectly.

I usually run a 8.5 or a 9 so my advice is to go lower if you’re in between sizes. These are super comfortable!"
UA,5,I walk approximately 8 miles at my job every day. I never tries Under Armor sneakers before. These are very comfortable and have good support. My feet are fine after a day of good hard work!
UA,5,I was a little afraid to buy these shoes because I have really wide feet. When I tried them on I was really happy because they fit perfectly and are so comfortable. You should definitely get these
UA,5,I was iffy about buying shoes without trying them on first. I'm so glad I did. Super comfortable and lightweight.
UA,5,I was looking for a pair of sneakers that had a wide toe box because I recently broke my baby toe and it hurt to wear anything but flip flops. These fit perfect. They are not wide width but perfectly wide in the toe. And comfy. I highly recommend.
UA,5,"I wear a 9-10, depending on the brand, I got these in a 10 and they are amazing ! Underarmour is such a high quality brand !"
UA,5,I wear the tennis for walking.  They are very comfortable.  True to size.  Good sturdy tennis.
UA,5,"I wear these daily for work in a warehouse, these are so comfortable for my 10 hour shifts."
UA,5,"I wore them out for a walk, they were comfortable."
UA,5,I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse & my feet don't hurt anymore since purchasing these shoes. They are made for more normal/narrow feet.
UA,5,I work in these shoes and I am on my feet a lot! These are the only shoes I have found ever that give me support. I looked for them for years. I am beyond happy and ordering more pairs. Buy them you will not be disappointed!!!’
UA,5,"I workout 5 days a week at my local gym. I do high impact classes and kept pulling muscles, until I bought these sneakers!!! They give the best support, fit perfect and did not cause any blisters and fit perfectly around my heel! Highly recommend these sneakers!!"
UA,5,I would buy these again..
UA,5,I would go a half size bigger
UA,5,"I would never run in these, too clunky. I use them for elliptical and strength training at home and I love them."
UA,5,I’m a nurse and on my feet 12-16 hours a day and have been wearing under armour shoes for 3 years and they have been great
UA,5,I’m extremely pleased with this shoe. The fit is great & did not have to break them in. Very cute also.
UA,5,I’m new to these shoes but my children swear to them.  They work great as my new walking shoe without being super bulky.  Great support.
UA,5,"I’m normally a 9 but reading the reviews I went with a 9.5 had to return and get a 10. That been said, these shoes are so freaking comfortable. Can wear them all day. Running, training walking love them"
UA,5,I’m on my feet all day as an OR nurse and these shoes really help with the back pain I’ve been experiencing. Good shoe would buy again.
UA,5,"I’m on my feet all day at work these shoes give great support. I would recommend ordering a size larger than you normally would- they are a bit snug, especially until you break them in."
UA,5,"I’m on my feet for 9+ hours a shift at my job. I have to say, I’ve never worn a pair of shoes to work that were so comfortable. Definitely purchasing these again!"
UA,5,"I’ve always worn Nike, but this Under Armour shoe is a perfect fit and so much more comfortable than any Nike shoe I’ve ever owned! I’ll definitely buy again!"
UA,5,I’ve hiked miles in these shoes and they are so comfortable and sturdy
UA,5,I’ve worn the brand before. I love the fit and comfort.
UA,5,"If you’re looking for comfort, these are it!! Just got mine in and they are soooo comfortable!!"
UA,5,"I'm not athletic on the regular, so as far as using these for sports daily I'm sure they work great, but I cannot say yes or no to that. I like to wear them to match my outfits, to go for a walk with my kids or to ride bikes. The fit is just right, I wear a size 7 and these fit great, not too big or too small. They are comfortable and easy to put on. The black color goes with just about everything as well."
UA,5,I'm on my feet 12 hrs a day and this shoe is comfy all day. The price is nice too
UA,5,"I'm very pleased with these shoes. I don't often buy athletic shoes online, but these worked out well. Size was perfect. They are very comfortable and stylish."
UA,5,"In reading reviews that sizes run small, I actually went to Under Armour shoe website.  They have a formula where you put in a known shoe brand that you already wear ( I used Skechers) and then they tell you what size you need in their brand. 99% of my life I take a true 7. Under Armour website said I needed a seven and a half. I ordered them from Amazon and they fit but they are a little snug all around. Otherwise very great shoe!"
UA,5,Instant comfort
UA,5,It fits well and is very comfortable to use 🥰
UA,5,"It has been over a month and I can say it has Good support and very comfortable. And, it looks great too."
UA,5,It has good support and comfortable to wear all day.
UA,5,"It is a great shoe.  It is very beautiful and the quality seems nice too.  I usually buy 9 and a half for my sneakers, but I am a runner and for this one I think should be better a size 10"
UA,5,It was good
UA,5,"It was the desert dehydration that got me, not the shoes. My feet and legs could have gone another 6 miles."
UA,5,"It’s a great work out shoe, it’s a little snug but that will take some time to break in"
UA,5,It’s comfortable
UA,5,It’s lightweight & great fit.
UA,5,It's comfortable and has a great support
UA,5,"It's comfortable, it's foamy, it's thick, it's secure. The only thing I didn't like was that the back was a bit high so it rubbed my skin off. Easy fix = just wear higher socks. These shoes are great and definitely good for college students who need to walk all day on campus.

I have wide feet and normally wear 8.5 for women. the shoe fits perfectly, no issues. I found that Under Armour shoes and sandals are wide enough for my feet!"
UA,5,It's pretty. Good quality
UA,5,"I've been in between a medium to wide width for my feet, so I gambled a bit purchasing the wide size...Needless to say, they were PERFECT!! I've been using them to go jogging, hiking, walking, and to the park.  They hold true for comfort and functionality.  Wait until they are on sale though (I got them for $52.50).  I hope this helps :)!"
UA,5,"I've been using expensive Saucony shoes for years. I decided to buy these as just run around town shoes since they looked a little nicer (the style that has worked for me only had really funky colors). These are my new work out shoes! They are so comfortable, so supportive, and have worked great!"
UA,5,I've never had a pair of UA shoes and I was very pleasantly surprised how great these are. Super comfortable and they look great. True to size. I just ordered another pair in a different color!
UA,5,"I've tried different shoes and I will admit that these are very comfortable, look nice... hold up well and the laces only need to be tied once."
UA,5,Just like my previous ones good looking shoe
UA,5,Just perfect for me.
UA,5,Just put these on and they feel great walking around the house in. Very supportive!!
UA,5,"Just usual wear there nice, and comfortable, but they charged me for shipping and they shouldn't have"

UA,5,Love these shoes! Comfy and cute! Order a 1/2 size or size up.
UA,5,Love these shoes! Great workout shoes and true to size
UA,5,Love these shoes! I’m very picky about my tennis shoes. These look great and are the most comfortable tennis shoe I have ever worn. I went half size up and got the wide and they were perfect! So happy. I wanted the white now too but no wide 7.5 left😩
UA,5,Love these shoes! Super comfortable & very supportive.
UA,5,"LOVE these shoes! They caused some blisters at first with the tight backs, but that soon went away. Fit TTS and the black color is so sleek"
UA,5,LOVE these shoes! They do run small. I ordered a half size up and had to swap them for a full size up. They were comfortable from the minute I put them on. They’ve been great for me.
UA,5,Love these shoes! They fit perfectly and are great for my workouts. No slipping or sliding.
UA,5,Love these shoes!! UA shoes are my favorite gym shoes.  These are lightweight and supportive and the laces stayed tied while I am working out. I was hesitant to buy gym shoes without trying them on first but because of Covid I haven't been able to get to the store. I am so glad I found these! Fit true to size and I love how the basic black and white matches with everything.
UA,5,Love these shoes.  Comfortable from the moment I put them on.
UA,5,Love these shoes. Got them today and are so comfortable. Can not wait to workout and go hiking in them.
UA,5,Love these shoes. I am on my feet all day and these are awesome. Sleek look and fit great.
UA,5,"Love these shoes. My feet are old and challenging. Wide, bunions etc.
I bought them a few days ago and they went up $18, yikes. Oh well."
UA,5,Love these shoes. They are perfect fit.
UA,5,Love these shoes. They look and feel great.
UA,5,Love these shoes. Very comfortable and true to size.
UA,5,Love these shoes. Very comfortable.  I wear size 8.5 or 9 and I bought these shoes in a size 9. They fit perfectly.
UA,5,Love these sneakers!
UA,5,Love these sneakers. I wear them all day!
UA,5,"Love these sneakers. They fit as expected. I don’t use wide shoes but sometimes my foot is to wide for some normal sized shoes. I’d say my foot is small, chubs, and square shaped. If that makes sense. These fit perfect with a little wiggle room by my toe. I wear a size 7.5. I wear an 8 but rarely.. only if the shoe is cut small.

I’m not a runner, but these seem comfortable to take a light jog or short run. Which I do on the treadmill. I mainly use them to lift weights/ walk/ and do HIIT workouts. They’re light in comfort, not a heavy shoe. Overall the shoe is what I expected it to be. The color is a little on the lighter grey side versus what’s shown in the pic.

Only wish they sold it in an all black color. I will be ordering a second pair for sure. The shoe is priced at an adequate price for the product, in my opinion. The last pair of running sneakers I bought were over $150 and they were by Brooks ( a real running shoe for long runs, in my opinion)

BUY IT! Less than $60 shoe is worth it."
UA,5,Love these sneakers..the colors are great and super comfy!!!
UA,5,Love these tennis shoes! Great fit and very comfortable!
UA,5,Love these! I will be ordering another pair in a different color soon!
UA,5,"Love these, fit perfect."
UA,5,"Love this brand of shoe, but I have a wide foot so it usually takes a while wearing them before they stretch out.  Not these!  I put these on and wore them all day. Super comfy. But, if you have a narrow foot, this UA shoe isn’t for you. Like I said, this is a great fit for wider feet. I work on my feet 8-9 hours a day, so I love these!!"
UA,5,Love this item love the color love the fit
UA,5,Love this shoe
UA,5,"Love this shoe!!! Very stylish and very comfortable!! I wear a 8.5 and that’s what I ordered, fits perfect! I got the black/white. Highly recommended. :-)"
UA,5,Love this shoe.
UA,5,"Love this shoe. Bought a second pair. I wear out tennis shoes fairly quickly but these are lasting so far. Plus, the price is reasonable to keep buying every couple months or so."
UA,5,love this sneakers delivered as promised
UA,5,Love UA shoes. I don't wear any other brand!
UA,5,Love under armour ahoes
UA,5,"Love Under Armour products, especially the shoes!"
UA,5,"Love Under Armour shoes!  They're my fave!  Super comfortable and fit perfectly.  Even though this is a running shoe, it's very supportive when I'm walking laps or around my neighborhood."

UA,5,Perfect fit and quality for my casual days with jeans at work.
UA,5,Perfect fit and true to size. Measure heel to toe and go from there. I ordered a wide just in case because Nike’s are too narrow. These are amazing. Where have they been my whole life??
UA,5,"Perfect fit, comfortable"
UA,5,"Perfect fit, very comfortable"
UA,5,"Perfect fit, which I was slightly surprised by. I usually get size 7.5 in sneakers to leave a little toe room, was afraid this pair of 7.0  might be too small. Wore it for my commute to work today and it was just super comfy.

I have another pair of Under Armour sneakers which I use for the gym once a week. Didn’t realize how worn the soles were on that pair until I put on the new pair this morning. The old ones looked brand new, but I’ve had it for over a year and it lost most of the cushioning, which some of my more active friends had mentioned were bad for your feet. Guess it’s true that you need to replace  workout sneakers every few month."
UA,5,"Perfect fit. Hard to find a shoe that is actually the right size. I am a 6.5 wide. These fit great, very comfortable.  Im so happy."
UA,5,Perfect fit. Little stiff on the heels but probably just need to be worn In like any new shoes. My chose my regular size of 8.5. Looked just like picture. I would recommend and order again.
UA,5,Perfect for everyday wear
UA,5,"Perfect for flat, narrow feet"
UA,5,Perfect love the product

UA,5,Perfectos para caminar
UA,5,Product fit as expected. Has good support. Not too much!  Looks and feels great!
UA,5,Product was exactly as expected.
UA,5,Purchased these shoes for walking and they're very comfortable.  I like a large toe box and usually buy Ryka but decided to give Under Armour a try.  They provide great cushioning and support and the pale gray/orange combo looks good too.  One thing to note - these shoes run small so go up at least a half size.  Love these shoes and would buy them again.
UA,5,"Quality, comfort and cute😊"
UA,5,"Rápido, fácil rastreo. Original under armour"
UA,5,Really comfortable

UA,5,Received fast and love the color. The style and fit was exactly as advertised.
UA,5,Run about a half size smaller than I usually wear...good thing I ordered up a half size on accident...great shoe!! Use for a high intensity work out!! Comfortable and great cushion for bottom of feet!! Very attractive look!!
UA,5,run small I had to return and order a size up.
UA,5,Sent back someone else bought her shoes
UA,5,Sent me the wrong color but that’s fine the ones that they sent me are really nice too they are very comfortable I love them

UA,5,Shoes fit and look great! I wear them daily on the floor. Ad a CNA I walk several miles a day on concrete floors.  These are the best I've found.
UA,5,"Shoes fit excellent, I really like that they have a more canvas like material instead of that soft mesh that isn't very supportive.  These feel way more supportive and feel like a high quality shoe.  Would definitely recommend these to anyone."
UA,5,Shoes fit perfct and comfortable
UA,5,"Showed up on time, It was a gift for a female friend, so thats all I can say lol!"
UA,5,Size was just right and they feel great!
UA,5,Sizing is perfect.  Comfort as advertized.
UA,5,Sizing was perfect
UA,5,Slightly tight but not enough I would send them back. Nothing a little wearing won't take care of. Otherwise they are comfortable and squishy! Def worth the money folks!
UA,5,So comfortable and fits true to size
UA,5,So comfy
UA,5,So comfy and nice style. Wide enough for my bunions!
UA,5,So far I am very happy with these shoes great support and comfortable to walk in
UA,5,So I never give 5 star reviews but these shoes are so comfortable! I was nervous buying shoes online since several size 8 people said they were too small but mine fit perfectly! I am a vet tech and we are on our feet all day long and my feet don’t hurt at all during the day nor during my work outs! Will buy again!
UA,5,"So worth it extremely comfy, love them. Look really nice on to."
UA,5,"Solid shoes. Be careful when ordering though. I clicked on the picture and thought I was getting the black and white ones, but the picture was wrong and I didn’t catch the color was different."
UA,5,"Son muy bonitos, me gustan"
UA,5,Son muy cómodos para hacer ejercicios
UA,5,Sooo comfy
UA,5,Soooo comfy and cute! I LOVE them. The fit was perfect!
UA,5,Stylish black tennis shoes... fits a little narrow. Comfortable to walk in... true to size... very happy with purchase!
UA,5,Super comfortable for long days in a doctors office! I have wide feet and they fit great! Most comfortable shoes for the price!!
UA,5,Super comfortable shoes!  Girlfriend absolutely loves them some of the best she has ever wore.
UA,5,"Super comfortable, great cushioning and support, I walk over 20k steps on concrete everyday and my feet don't hurt"
UA,5,Super comfortable. I wanted a workout shoe that was light and flexible. I felt all the Nike ones were too light and I decided to give these a try and I’m very happy with them.
UA,5,"Super comfortable. These are my gym shoes, and they get me through 5 HIIT workouts a week plus about 3 hours a week on the treadmill. I love these shoes."
UA,5,Super comfy
UA,5,Super comfy. Grips well. Sizing is perfect. I love that they have a “wide” option!
UA,5,Super comfy. I wore these all over town and my feet were not tired.
UA,5,Súper cómodos e ideal para hacer ejercicio
UA,5,"Súper confortable for long time on feet work, super resistant, pretty and good price"
UA,5,Talk about comfortable! These shoes fit perfectly and are super comfortable. They are very light and are super easy to wash off. I wore them all day at a theme park the first day I had them and my feet didn’t hurt at all !! These are amazing!!
UA,5,Tennis shoes for spring.  I love them!  Great look!
UA,5,"The back it a little too “stiff”, if you don’t wear the right socks, it’s a bit uncomfortable. Pretty good price though"
UA,5,The best shoes I ever bought!! Great fit and just as expected! Super comfortable for running and walking or any activities.
UA,5,"The bottom has a pretty strong grip, as in I can feel the shoes grabbing onto the concrete as I jog, better than slipping! Can’t wait to use it for hikes. The general shoe walls are stiff and might need a couple of days to break them in but that just means it’s sturdy. The shipping came as expected, especially during quarantine, still quick. As long as you know your shoe size, you should be good"
UA,5,The fit great true to size
UA,5,The fit is better than I expected.  Very comfortable especially if you have to be on your feet all day.
UA,5,The fit is good true to shoe size 8.5 feels supportive to my feet. There not particularly light but no heavy either. They look good too. Will be wearing these for work.
UA,5,"The hefty size of the soles is great for running. My legs and feet are less numb than usual. However the fit is a little tighter than expected, and the first week breaking them in had my toes sore after a few hours of wear. I usually only get this with boots, so it was surprising. Just keep in mind that getting a half-size up might be a good idea."
UA,5,"The most comfortable footwear I have ever worn!!! As a former footwear designer, I can attest to the quality of outsole, construction, and the last (the inside form in which your foot goes). These sneakers do not disappoint."
UA,5,"The only Issue I have is that they look like they were returned.
Zappos sent them to me. They were all laced up already and had NO TAGS!! The tissue in the box was all wrinkled!!"
UA,5,The shoe is comfy has the support I need. My last shoes didn’t have any support and I can tel the difference in my posture and how I stand with these.
UA,5,The shoes are great as well as other Under Armor products as expected.
UA,5,The shoes are so comfortable when walking and working out.
UA,5,The shoes are the most comfortable pair of shoes that I own. I bought them to work out in and I have no complaints. I will definitely buy these again.
UA,5,The shoes fit great.  Very comfortable.
UA,5,"The shoes itself are nice, but I would suggest ignoring the size chart. I normally wear between a 9.5 to a 10, but I chose to follow the given chart and ordered an 8.5 that ended up being too small. I got it switched for my normal 9.5 and it works just fine"
UA,5,"The shoes themselves are pretty comfy. Decent support, and I like the classic style of them. My only dislike is the high backs. They take time adjust to and find the right comfort. Other than that, I do like them and can’t wait to wear them more."
UA,5,The shoes were perfect to size and very comfortable!
UA,5,"These are amazing for high arches! I run with these shoes but have then for walking and everyday use as well. Very comfortable all over, the heals don’t dig into my skin. This is the most supportive shoe I have ever had!"
UA,5,These are amazing!! I love the fit and feel! They look so stylish.
UA,5,These are by far the best sneakers I've owned in a long time! Very comfortable and light feeling.  Im excited to take them on a jog!
UA,5,"These are excellent shoes. A little narrow, but that is remedied by letting out the laces just a touch. Very comfortable to stand in for an extended time, flexible without any pinching, and warm, but breathable. I will definitely be purchasing another pair in a different color. I was worried based on the reviews the 7s were getting, but these 8s are fantastic."
UA,5,These are great for thee weed five miles I walk every day on our road. Will buy again. They give my feet so much support.
UA,5,These are great!  Could not get over what a difference they make in my comfort while walking. Loving the black color too
UA,5,These are literally the best shoes I’ve ever had. I used them all through Fire Academy and my feet didn’t hurt. I now use them for local hiking when I don’t want to wear my hiking boots. They’re lightweight and dry quickly if you get them wet.
UA,5,These are my all-time favorite shoes.
UA,5,These are perfect
UA,5,These are perfect for the gym. Just what I wanted a comfortable supportive shoe that looks great.
UA,5,These are perfect in every way. Size is true & I do not have any problem with the fit.
UA,5,These are so comfortable!
UA,5,These are some of the most comfortable tennis shoes that I’ve ever worn.
UA,5,"These are soo comfortable and I love the style. I bought them to replace my clogs for work as a nurse I am on my feet 12 plus hours my feet kill me, I have a good feeling these are going to be perfect. I may actually order a second pair to use for the gym!"
UA,5,"These are the best shoes ever! I had got my son a pair of under armor shoes one time at Ross and they held up through 3 more children and still look brand new. I got myself a pair and I will never buy another brand for everyday ""all the time"" wear."
UA,5,These are the best shoes. They are super comfortable and last forever. I’ve been wearing them everyday and they don’t get worn down at all.
UA,5,"These are the BEST tennis shoes I have ever owned. I have had lower back and sciatica for years. Sine wearing these shoes, my back pain is almost healed! I am tempted to buy multiple pair just to have them!"
UA,5,"These are the best, most supportive tennis shoes I have ever owned. I have to wear clogs to work everyday because I stand on my feet all day at work, but wearing such ugly shoes really limits my wardrobe, so I go to work often looking like an unstylish loser. These UA shoes are just what I need to feel like myself at work while at the same time having some old ass feet that will have issues if I don’t wear supportive shoes. Great buy and only $55! I think I’ll buy some in black next so I can wear them on my property without worrying about them being too dirty to wear to work."
UA,5,These are the comfiest walking shoes I have ever owned. I walked 10 miles yesterday and didn't have any pain or discomfort. They keep nice and cool and really support the foot. I will only use these sneaks to work out from now on.
UA,5,these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever
UA,5,These are the most comfortable shoes! I have tried many brands but these are the only shoes that accommodate my wide feet.
UA,5,These are the most comfortable shoes!! They are made well and fit perfectly!  I purchased them because I needed a shoe that I could stand on my feet for five hours doing volunteer work!!! My first pair of Under Armour; but not my last!
UA,5,These are the most comfortable shoes. I am on my feet for hours a day! I also love these for working out! Probably the BEST pair of sneakers I have ever purchased. Great design.
UA,5,These are very comfortable and stylish.
UA,5,"These are very good looking, comfortable and supportive.  Also very light"
UA,5,"These are well made, comfortable and fit well. They had looked too big, but ended up fitting just right."
UA,5,These felt good from day one. I will be ordering another pair!
UA,5,"These fit perfectly and they look really nice. A little more athletic looking than an Addidas Cloud foam, just for reference. My teen daughter loves these!"
UA,5,"These look just like the picture, fit perfect, and are so comfortable and offer a lot of support. Great price!"
UA,5,"These running shoes are very light and comfortable- they make it easier to walk/jog longer distances. I had to buy them a full size up than my normal size (I’m an 8, and a 9 fit- I even tried an 8 1/2 and they were still too small lengthwise)."
UA,5,These shoes are amazing!  They are super comfortable.  I use them for walking.  Some shoes give me blisters on the back of my ankles unless I wear higher ankle socks.  These allow me to wear no show socks without the blisters.  Not only are they comfortable but they look stylish as well!
UA,5,"These shoes are amazing! They’re so comfortable, fit perfectly, and they’re cute too! I love UA!!!"
UA,5,"These shoes are AMAZING!!!
I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT BUYING SHOES ONLINE...BUT THESE FIT PERFECTLY!!
THANK YOU AMAZON!!!"
UA,5,These shoes are great! I’m a nurse and being on my feet 12+ hours a day means I need GOOD tennis shoes that’s are comfortable and keep my feet from hurting at the end of the day! They are easy to keep clean too!
UA,5,"These shoes are GREAT!! The first couple of days I wore them I was a little concerned if I had chosen the wrong shoes, but figured maybe they just needed to be ""broken in."" Now I am SURE they are the RIGHT choice! I am on my feet ALL day every day on concrete floors, and my feet were hurting SO bad they would burn by the time I got home, so I purchased these and they are EXCELLENT!! I highly recommend these if you are one your feet for long periods of time. I will definitely be buying these again, well worth the money!!"
UA,5,"These shoes are great. Listed as running shoes, but I use for running, Hiit, etc. I love them so much, I bought them in gray as well! Comfortable, do not slide when working out and stylish! love!"
UA,5,"These shoes are of excellent quality. I’m usually a 7 1/2 and have wide feet, so thankfully I ordered a size 8. They fit just right. Would buy again."
UA,5,These shoes are really confort and very good looking. Construction seem durable although the materials are very light. I like them a lot. Fully recommended.
UA,5,These shoes are so comfortable and exactly what I wanted! Love them!
UA,5,"These shoes are SO comfortable! I normally wear a 6.5/7 among all my different style of shoes and have these in a size 7 and they fit perfectly.

These shoes have an easily maneuverable fabric around the whole shoe which follow into a very secure rubber like base/sole. The base of this shoe is very lightweight - actually the entire shoe is very light. The inside is like a squishy gel like padding - super comfy! I wore these all day for work (standing and walking for 8 hours) and my feet didn’t hurt! Even after work with some light jogging - no blisters and my feet felt great!

I am super impressed with these shoes and they’re a first for me from this brand - very satisfied 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
UA,5,These shoes are so comfortable! I’m very happy with them.
UA,5,These shoes are very comfortable. I bought them for the walks I go on with my dog and my feet feel so much better with these shoes. Even after being on my feet all day at work my feet still feel great.
UA,5,"These shoes are very comfy but I do order a 1/2 size larger than other tennis shoes.  They do not seem to last as long as other brands, but the comfort outweighs that!"
UA,5,"These shoes are very sleek looking, but also very comfortable. They fit true to size."
UA,5,These shoes came out of the box feeling great.
UA,5,These shoes fit really nice and look really good.
UA,5,These shoes offer a lot of support and add a bounce to your step. Only complaint is that the sides where the outer soles of the feet are feel wonky when walking on uneven ground. My husband got a pair too.
UA,5,These shoes ran smaller than my other Under Armour sneakers. Had to order 1/2 size larger for the perfect fit.
UA,5,These shoes were the perfect size.  they hug my feet with no rubbing and seem to be very supportive.
UA,5,These shoes will be great for walking and general wear.
UA,5,These sneakers are supportive and comfortable. I m happy I bought them.
UA,5,These sneakers not only look awesome and stylish but they are very comfy!
UA,5,These tennis shoes are so comfortable.
UA,5,These tennis's are very comfortable!! I have psoriasis on my feet and the breathing style shoes are good for my feet.
UA,5,These UA shoes look good and feel good on my feet. I needed a comfortable all black shoe for work and I’m happy with these. They have a lot of cushion in the foot sole. I’ll have to see how they hold up to walking and standing all day. I decided to size up one half size and I’m glad I did cause they run a little small. The shipping was fast!
UA,5,These were a bit snug when I first tried them on but they stretched with wear. I normally wear a 6.5 and that's exactly what I ordered. They don't provide  great support because I've only worn them out walking twice (about 4 miles each time) and my heals hurt on both feet. I didn't have that problem with my old shoes. These look good though.
UA,5,"These were a gift for my grandmother and she loved them, they look really nice."
UA,5,"These work well with my minimal arch. Fit perfectly to me, and would order again."
UA,5,Thesebrunning shoes fit exactly as expected and are extremely comfortable. I will definitely be ordering more pairs! ❤
UA,5,"They are a great fit, comfortable and I where them for almost everything, working out walking, to work."
UA,5,"They are a very nice looking running shoe. Seemed a bit slippery on tile at first but traction and stopping is the best I have ever seen with running shoes. I love the Under Armor brand and these shoes are an addition you will need if you run. They are lightweight, designed great, very comfortable. Laces stay tied. My daughter loves her pair she says it's like running on air. Very glad I got to try this product through the Vine Voice program. I feel confident in recommending this item and feel you will glad you purchased them."
UA,5,They are Comfortable and look good!
UA,5,They are comfortable especially for waking and it’s a good fit.
UA,5,They are comfy. I never had that uncomfortable feeling you get the first time you wear a pair of shoes. I just put them on and went for a run. Perfect!
UA,5,"They are great for walking, did not need a break in, comfortable from the start.  They are definitely for walking/running not for wearing everyday, too clunky.  I really like them overall."
UA,5,They are nice comfortable
UA,5,They are perfect. Very comfy and easy to wear.
UA,5,They are super comfy. And they fit really well
UA,5,They are to small! Used for walking!
UA,5,"They are very comfortable and I like how they look. The first time I tried them on though, they hurt my ankles but only the first day I walked 4 miles. I think they just need to stretch as after that they have been very comfortable. I am not running, I am walking fast 6 days of the week around 4 miles each day and so far so good."
UA,5,They are very comfortable and the fit is spot on
UA,5,They are very comfortable they fit my feet well
UA,5,"They are very comfortable, just like the picture listed the size is just as it says its supposed to be, these are the best shoes I have bought and will be buying another pair!"

UA,5,they way the feel while I am wearing them

UA,5,"Third pair purchased for work On my feet 8 hours good fit
Probably not good for a heavy workout/serious run"
UA,5,"This is a really great shoe! Fits nicely and is very comfortable! I broke my baby pinky toe, and this was the only shoe I could wear that didn’t hurt my toe."
UA,5,This is a well made and comfortable shoe!
UA,5,"This is my 2nd pair of Under Armour sneakers and I really like them.  The fit/support is nearly perfect!  I purchases 3 pairs of sneakers of various name brands, (Nike and Adidas) to test the fit and these fit the best.  Very happy!"
UA,5,"This is my first pair of Under Armour Shoes.  I had tried on a pair in a store but felt the price was to high.  I searched for a pair on line and found these at a good price.  They arrived quickly and I must say they give great support, light weight  and the width and length are spot on.  I am not a runner, but use these for everyday wear.  I am over 70 and need support as my hip bothers me otherwise.  With this pair I have no hip issues.  I highly recommend this brand."
UA,5,this is my second pair I've purchased this year! I have the black also and love both of them! you can't beat the price!
UA,5,"This is my second pair of black and I have also got a gray pair. Love them!
I have to wear a wide and these fit perfectly."
UA,5,This is my second pair of this type shoe. Would buy again.
UA,5,"This is my second pair of under armour. I love the look, the fit, and they last many years"
UA,5,"This is my second pair, the only thing I have to say is they run about a half size small. I normally wear 6 1/2, I had to get these in a 7."
UA,5,This is my third pair of Under Armour shoes. I play pickleball 4 days per week and these are comfortable and fit perfectly. (Since I wear sport socks I always go up a half size in shoes). Although these technically running shoes this particular style of Under Armour Is still great for the court because of the tread pattern and heel shape. Highly recommend.
UA,5,This is nice lightweight running shoes.  I like them and I am very picky about my walking shoes.  Nice fit true to size.  I wear a 6.5 and they fit perfect and comfortable.
UA,5,This is the 2nd pair of this shoe that I have purchased . Most comfortable every day athletic shoe I have. I tend to pronate but do not with this shoe. I normally wear an 8.5 or a 9 and the 9 fits perfect . I also have a somewhat narrow foot and the fit is fine on that too. My exercise mainly consists of walking long distances. 7 to 8 miles every other day. I am 70 years old. Highly recommend this shoe for the price and comfort.
UA,5,"This is the first time I tried using Under Armour shoe products other than Nike shoes.  I'm not gonna lie, I am very picky when it comes to running shoes, and I always end up having Nike product at the end due to shoe sizing and confortability while running/walking.  This, however, I can tell you, I enjoy using this. Running, walking, and style is GREAT! No complain here, and the style and color got swag on it.  I just hope it has the durability of nike, but I have to wait for another month or two to see how it can last long, since its still brand new.  The size is the same as nike for reference (at least for me)."
UA,5,"This is the second pair I bought, so that should sum up how much I like these sneakers. I wear them to work, I am on my feet quite a bit and they look good too.  I would recommend these sneakers."
UA,5,"This is the second time I have purchased these sneakers! They fit perfect, I dont have to break them in, great for long walks. Highly recommend"
UA,5,This is the third purchase if the same shoe. Excellent!
UA,5,This is what she picked out and when they arrived she loves them and says they are very comfortable. I would say they was a very good buy!
UA,5,This produce met all my expectations.
UA,5,This product is very nice. Its very comfortable to walk for a long day on these UA shoes
UA,5,This product was perfect! My wife loved it! Thank you
UA,5,This shoe fits well and looks exactly like the picture.  It will be perfect for travel and casual wear.
UA,5,This shoe is extremely comfortable but they always seems to fit 1/2 size smaller. Ordrr we up if you are in between sizes. Or order 2 different and return one.
UA,5,This shoe is very comfortable. I'm on my feet for long periods of time and I do not have any complaints.
UA,5,"tl;dr - Snug but comfy. Works with orthotics. Good cushioning. Not much ankle bracing.

These shoes have a much pointier toe than the Sketchers I usually wear, and a large bump in the back to grip your Achilles tendon (I was skeptical, but it works). They are most comfortable when laced and tied tightly. (So, basically, Under Armor for your feet).

The footbed is just a flat piece of foam - no arch support or heel cup. It peels right out if you want to replace that, and the insole underneath is nicely finished.

The heel is softer than most other performance shoes I'm used to, and doesn't really have much by way of a flange. So, these are great for the gym, or the track, or maybe a nice clear sidewalk. Not so much on a forest trail, or anything similarly challenging.

City shoes. NTTAWWT."
UA,5,Todo fue de mi agrado!
UA,5,Todo muy bien
UA,5,Too rigid for me
UA,5,"Took a couple of wears to break in, but after that, very comfortable. Only can wear my left one for awhile as I broke my right ankle (in my home, not wearing the shoes)"
UA,5,"Took the advice of some reviews and went a half size up. Usually wear a 10, I ordered a 10.5. The half size up was more like an entire size up. Exchanged for my normal size."
UA,5,"True fit, comfy"
UA,5,"True to size, very comfortable.  I suffer from plantar fasciitis so I as m very picky about my shoes."
UA,5,True to size.
UA,5,Ty
UA,5,Ummmmmm..... super cute! Can go with anything and everything. I love them. Picture on amazon does not do them justice. I was more impressed upon arrival.
UA,5,"Under Armor has the best athletic shoes for me.
They have good support for my workouts."
UA,5,"Under Armour are my favorite shoes in the world!
Theyre the easiest to tie & untoe, the most comfortable by far! Been wearing their shoes since they were born, Love!!!"
UA,5,"Under Armour shoes are the only ones that I can wear all day at work, on my feet, and not have any pain at all. I love the other pair I have and was really excited about these but they run small. I’m normally a 6.5 and had to return these. I would need a 7.5 in these. Wish they had worked out"
UA,5,"Under Armour sneakers have been my favorite for years! Very lite weight, comfortable, long lasting. Disappointing because I tried ordering another pair that don't have them anymore! Highly highly recommend"
UA,5,"Update.  After 7 months the upper heal has a hole.
Will need to buy a new pair soon.  I only use them indoors while working out.  Average of 4-5 hours a week.  A bit disappointed they didn't even last a year.  -----Original post. Great shoe!  Fits perfectly.  Great support.  I normally have a lot of issues with heal slipping or arch support, these are great."

UA,5,Walking
UA,5,Walking and running
UA,5,Walking around the house and going out for dinner just needed a good all purpose shoe that wear well
UA,5,was exactly what I expected
UA,5,Was so surprised at how great they looked. They are very comfortable. TY Amazon
UA,5,Was worried about buying shoes online...but they are perfect! Thinking of going ahead and buying another pair for back up now 😃
UA,5,Wear for work.  I'm a bartender.
UA,5,"Well i just got it today! I used to run and it’s pretty comfortable. I don’t think it’s comfortable enough for a long shift but it’s much more comfortable than the new balances i bought. I also accidentally bought the wrong color but the black on black is cute. It has this cushion part inside on the heel part which i like. Overall, i like these shoes and it’s day one!"
UA,5,What a comfortable shoe! Fit perfect. Purchased as a work sneaker and looks great!
UA,5,"When I first put them on, they were a snug fit but they quickly formed to fit my foot. These are some of the best shoes I own! They are so comfortable and feel like memory foam."
UA,5,Wife was happy
UA,5,Will buy these shoes again- also bought for my kids. They are perfect!
UA,5,"Wish I had gotten a backup pair. I wear them everyday. It really stabilizes my ankles which is something difficult for me to find in shoes. There is good support. Short walks, long walks, fast walks, at work. I got them as a running shoe but after the Nike’s I had weren’t performing as I wanted them to as an everyday shoe I decided I’d use these."
UA,5,Wonderful.. Perfect fit..
UA,5,Working
UA,5,Would have given a better rating for comfort but the back of the shoes is too hard.  Other than that I love it. I had a knee replacement so I'm very particular about the shoes I wear.  These give me the support I need.
UA,5,x
UA,5,Zapatos muy cómodos
Adidas,4,A little narrow (I have a wide foot) but overall comfort & stylish.
Adidas,4,Adidas are my favorite brand of shoes! I love the cloud foam however this particular pair hurt my feet so much! I’ve never had a problem with any of my adidas shoes besides this one. Sizing is the same!
Adidas,4,"Adidas have come highly recommended to me as someone who wears a larger size shoe (women’s 10) but these were about a half size too big. My sister is an 11 and she said they fit her just fine. I’ll reorder a smaller size and if those work then I’ll use them for the light workouts/walking. The support is ok, but I’m considering an insert because I have a high instep and I don’t think these are an “all day” shoe for me as they are now. I will say I loved the slip-on option because I hate messing with laces."
Adidas,4,"After reading all the reviews about Adidas sneakers running large, I decided to go with my usual street shoe size of 8-1/2, rather than my sneaker size of 9.  When I first tried them on, they felt perfectly sized, comfortable, and were adorable.  However, after wearing a few times, they stretched out by at least a half size, so now I wish I would have ordered a half size smaller than my regular shoe size.  I'll still wear them because they're so darned cute, but I don't like the feeling of a lot of space between my big toe and the end of the shoe.  Live and learn.  Maybe this will help future buyers!  If they weren't $50, I'd order another pair in 8 instead of 8-1/2."
Adidas,4,"Although this sneaker is very light and easy to slip on/off, it is lacking in cushion and support in my opinion.  However the look is cute and the price is right"
Adidas,4,amazing gift
Adidas,4,"Amazon has the cheapest price on this version of Adidas. The cloudfoam isn't mind blowing, but comfortable for work wear and daily use. Typically, I wear a 7.5-8 W US, but I have wide feet and I purchased both sizes and the 8 had more space and a lot more comfy. So they run true to size but if you have wide feet I'd go up half a size. The laces are just part of a design, so they're just stylish. I'd double knot them so you don't have to retie them every so often.

I haven't had any issues with the quality of the shoe - been about 2 weeks."
Adidas,4,As my girlfriend has pointed out these shoes are great but everything could be better. I wonder say she thinks about me...
Adidas,4,"Bigger than all my other tennis shoes, but super cute shoe and very cute color. Had to return for different size though."
Adidas,4,"Bought it for my teenager and she loves it. I don't think it's good enough to be used as running shoes. But it definitely looks good and can be used for light workouts, IMO."
Adidas,4,Bought there for my mom and went a half a size down and they were still a tad large. These run big but other than that are very lightweight and comfortable
Adidas,4,"Bought these as a gift f my daughter, she absolutely adores them. I see her wearing them often!"
Adidas,4,"Bought these because the price was so good and I love Adidas.
Great support and super comfy just wish I could tighten them a little better to fit properly without filling to wide"
Adidas,4,Bought these for my wife and she says they feel like she's walking on clouds.
Adidas,4,"Bought these to wear at work (I work in healthcare) and they are great! Very comfy but relatively sleek, not bulky. Wouldn't necessarily recommend for running long distances, but great for being on your feet."
Adidas,4,"But narrow for me so it’s not the most comfortable. If you have a Costco membership, I believe you can get the gray one for cheaper"
Adidas,4,Comfortable
Adidas,4,Comfortable and decent arch support
Adidas,4,Comfortable and light weight. I should have ordered a half size smaller because they are on the this side (as in breathable)
Adidas,4,"Comfortable but soles are pretty thin, can feel rocks when walking."
Adidas,4,Comfortable but they do rubthe top of my foot where my socks dont cover my skin
Adidas,4,"Comfortable but when you’re standing all day long, the memory foam isn’t as good as everyone says"
Adidas,4,Comfortable shoe just a bit narrow for my foot and a little long.
Adidas,4,Comfortable shoe. Not as hard as the other shoes i own that hurt my feet. Easy to get on.
Adidas,4,Comfortable shoes. Use them for walking and errand running. No running. I love them ! I bought a pair for my mom.
Adidas,4,comfortable stylish shoes you can slip on anytime.
Adidas,4,"Comfortable, probably wouldn’t wear if I had to walk all day due to medium support. Major downside is the sewing on one side was off- causes a section to press into my ankle. I might just cut it off."
Adidas,4,Comfy and got a treat price
Adidas,4,Comfy initially feet start to hurt after awhile. Definitely not work out appropriate..more wear short term running errands.
Adidas,4,"Comfy, run around type sneakers (which is why I bought them) but not enough support or cushioning beyond the heel for any real working out. Great shoe for the price though and the are very versatile!"
Adidas,4,"Comfy, slide in and out without tying. Super light, wouldn't be great for high impact exercise, but comfy daily sneaker."
Adidas,4,"Comfy, soft, light, but seem less quality than my other adidas."
Adidas,4,Compared to my brooks they’re like concrete. Still nice though.
Adidas,4,Cute and comfortable but definitely run big. I read a review saying the same thing but thought I would stick with the size I wear 90% of the time. But these were too big to work around. Returning and going down half a size. Super upset that I have to wait to get my other pair. But that’s the chance we take when buying online.
Adidas,4,Cute and comfortable shoes
Adidas,4,"Cute shoe. Comfy. Great to slip on and run errands, but not much else. Not a whole lot of support in the arches,etc. Definitely run big, order a size down than you normally would."
Adidas,4,Cute shoes but not much support or cushion.
Adidas,4,"Cute shoes, flattering style, but I would not do anything other than walking in these."
Adidas,4,"Cute, comfortable, and 8deal for my ""busy"" days."
Adidas,4,"Cute, slip on athletic shoe for running errands or walking around. It doesn’t have enough support for heavy exercise so I wouldn’t use it for that. The other reviews are indeed true about this shoe running big. I normally wear an 8.5 in ASICS, and a 9 in Brooks and Nike running shoes. I bought an 8.5 in this shoe based on the reviews to size down and it was too long. Returning for a size 8."
Adidas,4,"Decent for the price. Lightweight. Comfortable for everyday, light wear but not enough support for running or work."
Adidas,4,"definitely a thin shoe. i was surprised when i put these on because there is not much support and it really does feel like thin padding. they are cute and stylish and good for weight lifting at the gym. definitely not running or cardio because they don’t offer support. for running you need lots of padding and arch support, definitely know what you are wanting these shoes for before you buy them."
Adidas,4,Didn’t realize you can’t tighten the laces until I got them. This makes them less than ideal for running but they’re still great for working out or wearing every day
Adidas,4,"Due to other reviews I bought a size up, wish I wouldn't have cause now they're too big. I'll be returning for my original size.
Other than that I really like the look of the shoe & they seem comfortable from trying on but I haven't actually got to wear them yet."
Adidas,4,"EDIT: 1/22/21: I have had them a few weeks and if you’re buying these for running I would seek other shoes. They seem more for fashion unfortunately. My feet hurt and I’m looking for new shoes already!

1/10/21: I love these shoes. They are very comfortable and cute. They would compliment a lot of outfits if you’re buying them for fashion reasons over workout. I bought a 7 which is my normal running shoe size, they fit a little snug but my socks are on the thicker size. If you wear thick socks I would say size up a half size for maximum comfort. I haven’t done my workouts in them yet so I cannot speak on how they will hold up. I’ll update in about a month."
Adidas,4,Exactly what I expected
Adidas,4,"Excellent shoe. Just doesn't have much arch support.
They only weigh a few ounces, both together."
Adidas,4,"Fit perfectly in my normal size, comfortable and light weight."
Adidas,4,"Fit perfectly.  Can't wait to wear them.  After reading reviews, I will not use to run in, don't seem to have enough support for running.  Very light weight for walking.  A good comfort sneaker."
Adidas,4,Fit smaller and tighter than expected. Had to return the product
Adidas,4,"Fit well
Very thin shoe
Laces are pretty much pointless
Overall okay shoe"
Adidas,4,"Fits 1/2 size large in my opinion, but very comfortable"
Adidas,4,"Fits as expected, good for healthcare or hospital workers who walk a lot."
Adidas,4,Fits differently than previous model. Fits tighter around the tongue. Not as comfortable
Adidas,4,Fits perfectly and way more comfortable than I thought!
Adidas,4,Gave it to my daughter
Adidas,4,"Good adidas shoe, just too big for me who usually wears a size 8.5
Would recommend sizing half or even 1 whole size down."
Adidas,4,Good for walking
Adidas,4,Good shoe. Good price. I did add inserts for better support. Not much cushion.
Adidas,4,"Good sneaker for a nice walk,or a day out with the family."
Adidas,4,"Good support in the ankle. Comfy and very light weight, fit live a glove."
Adidas,4,Good walking shoe but I wouldn’t run in them
Adidas,4,Got them for my wife and her complaint is that there’s no arch support and running in these shoes is fair. Had better running shoes for less  She ended up buying another pair instead.
Adidas,4,Got these for my daughter she really loves them! They are super lightweight and comfy. My daughter says yes she recommends :)
Adidas,4,Got these to replace a pair of New Balance that are very similar.  I wear a 6 1/2 in nearly every shoe.  These slide right off my feet.  Won’t return but plan to gift them to my daughter who’s a 1/2 size bigger than me.
Adidas,4,"Got this shoe as a comfortable shoe to wear for the athleisure aesthetic and for light walking and it is great. Very comfortable, but definitely not a running shoe or workout shoe. Fits TTS."
Adidas,4,Granddaughter liked them.
Adidas,4,Great color & comfy - I wore them all day on the 1st day. Easy to slip on& the back holds up to make it easier.
Adidas,4,great color and super comfy! the sole feels a little off but dont worry you wont notice it when you're out strolling around
Adidas,4,"Great color, awesome comfort,  while it lasted. Will be replacing the insole. Not made for long periods of wear."
Adidas,4,"Great item
Little pricey for quality"
Adidas,4,"Great look, just not as cushiony as I’d like"
Adidas,4,"Great looking shoe and my wife loves them, but they should sell these as light-turquoise or something. The blue tint is a bit strong. No way are these white. Great shoes though"
Adidas,4,"Great looking shoe, but I wouldn’t recommend it for working out, excessive walking or running.  Great as an everyday sneaker.  Very comfortable and light but limited thread and support."
Adidas,4,"Great pair of shoes! Needed a new pair that would hold up during a day at Epcot. I saw these and kept them in mind. By fortune the shoes were at a store I was in, so I tried them on. Good thing I did because I ended up getting them a half size smaller when I later ordered them on Amazon. Very comfortable and nice to look at. Never once did they hurt my feet."
Adidas,4,"Great price, comfortable, love the color. Only negative is they run big. I wear size 7, these are more like 7 1/2  or 8"
Adidas,4,Great shoe
Adidas,4,Great shoe but does run a half size small.
Adidas,4,Great shoe but fits a little snug. I wore them for 3 workouts and my foot kept cramping up so not sure if they are truly for working out or more for style but they are definitely cute.
Adidas,4,Great shoe to wear when you're on your feet for long periods of time this is my second pair. I hate how easy it is for water to get through the shoes if it's raining you can guarantee your feet are going to be soaked.
Adidas,4,"Great shoe, very stylish, runs 1/2 size big in my opinion. I usually wear an 8 but these were a little loose so probably could have gotten the 7 1/2. Definitely not a running shoe but good for every day wear."
Adidas,4,"Great shoes but they get messy really quick
I know they are white, but in comparison with my other pairs of white sneakers I need to clean them way too often"
Adidas,4,Great shoes! I bought for my daughter and they are a little snug on her foot even though they are her size.
Adidas,4,Great shoes.  Extremely comfortable.
Adidas,4,"Great shoes. Very comfy! However, ventilation is a bit of on issue, which may be a personal issue, but, my feet do get very sweaty if I wear them the whole day. Very comfortable though and I love how they look."
Adidas,4,I actually purchased the sneakers twice I liked them so much. The only problem is that the sides of my foot kind of hang off the shoe soles of the shoe a little bit. But the sneakers are stretchy so it's comfortable.
Adidas,4,I always wear a 6 1/2 in womens. These are running about 1/2 bigger.
Adidas,4,"I am a pretty solid size 8 (US) normally with most brands of shoes and only occasionally require an 8.5. With this in mind and by precisely measuring my foot and using the size chart to determine my size needed, I concluded a size 8 should be perfect. These shoes have loosened up a tiny bit since getting them but I really think I could have used an 8.5 and been more comfortable. Although I can wear the shoes, I would have been happier had I ordered a half size larger. I would return them but I hate the hassle and also knowing they might end up in a landfill or destroyed if they are returned."
Adidas,4,I am impressed with the comfort.  So glad I got these comfortable and stylish running shoes
Adidas,4,I am in love with these shoes they are great for running just not great for other calisthenic workouts.
Adidas,4,I am keeping these shoes but the tongue area is uncomfortable.  If you have a high instep these shoes are not for you.  I have to work hard to get mt foot into shoe.
Adidas,4,I am usually a 7 but bought these as a half size up since that’s what I’ve worn for years in Nike. Don’t be me and do this. I should have gotten the 7. Good shoe but a little too big. Going to give them to my daughter who wears a bigger shoe than myself.
Adidas,4,"I bought a pair of Adidas Cloudfoam Pure a few years ago that I have absolutely loved & worm out! I have bought 3 other Adidas styles since then that were fine but not as great as the Cloudfoam Pure. I set out to try & get this level of comfort back with this pair. I tried them on a felt like the cushioned comfort was good but this pair has a fixed position tongue that was stiff & rubbed on the front of my ankle. It may not bother other people but I felt like it was going to be an issue for me, so sadly I returned this pair."
Adidas,4,I bought the shoe strictly for work since I'm constantly on my feet. Not much sturdiness to it (I have flat feet). I got what I expected from the price. Fits as expected. I would not recommend working out in this shoe at all.
Adidas,4,I bought these after I broke a couple toes and needed shoes other than sandals to walk in.  These have a really soft footbed that is supportive but not rigid.  The shoe holds my toes in place without making them hurt.
Adidas,4,"I bought these on sale and I was pleasantly surprised. I found they do run a little large. I bought them as everyday shoes and not to workout in. They are seriously like wearing slippers they are so comfy. As far as quality, only time will tell. So far, so good!"
Adidas,4,"I bought these shoes a few months ago and they were amazing when I bought them! There are holding up great with how much I use them. 6-10 hours 5-6 days a week for work (on my feet the whole time), playing sports with friends, and for running which only happened a handful of times. The soles don’t have much traction anymore which disappointed me a bit but everything else is still great which is why I am still wearing them."
Adidas,4,"I bought these shoes for a trip to France and they were great, but only when I wore orthotics inside. They're incredibly comfortable but they have a really thin sole. I walked dozens of miles in these with no pain and they looked really good and fit with the style of locals."
Adidas,4,I bought these shoes to replace my nike free run sneakers that I use for daily walks and gym workouts. I was surprised at how little arch support these offer and they aren't as cushion-y as I wanted.  I don't think these would be great for running but they are working well for my gym workouts.  These also run large. I'm a 6 1/2 and these shoes feel more like 7s to me. All in all I'm happy with my purchase but if I get back into running I'll need to find a different shoe.
Adidas,4,"I bought these shoes with the intention of wearing them all day everyday since I'm a stay at home mom with a very active toddler. They are great shoes except for the fact that there's very little cushion in the sole for support, especially if you're wearing them all day. Only giving 4 out of 5 stars because I had to put sole inserts inside. Otherwise they look great and wash well in the washer."
Adidas,4,"I bought these sneakers to workout and they have been great! I am usually a 7.5 in regular shoes and an 8 in sneakers, I bought an 8 and they were slightly big but I kept them cause they felt very comfortable in that size. Super light weight. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel that they could have a little more cushion on the sole of shoe."
Adidas,4,"I bought these to wear during PT post surgery because I thought they were laceless... and getting someone else to tie your shoes when you're a grown a$$ adult is no fun. I wanted stylish slip ons to wear to the gym for rehab. In fact, when you search Amazon for laceless tennis shoes, these are the recommended ""bestseller""... Well I should have read the reviews and looked at the helpful photos before ordering because they do have laces. I ended up removing the laces in one shoe. No big deal but ultimately a tad disappointed. I tied the other shoe inside and they still slip on and fit nice. Not sure the laces provide any function, so I'm not sure why they have to tie at all. I like the fit and comfort of the shoes and can imagine wearing them even when I can go back to tying my own shoes :)"
Adidas,4,"I can see why some reviews say the insole is thin. Clearly isn’t a running shoe but they make a great walking/ errand running shoe. Stretchy material, making it a great travel shoe too!"
Adidas,4,I did not like them so I returned them
Adidas,4,I do love the shoes they are comfortable and nice basic black/white mesh super light weight flexible. Not great with support I added extra insoles to compensate for that because I stand for 8 hours a day sometimes more other then that love them just with the support was better.
Adidas,4,"I do not love the seam where the sole meets the toes but this shoe is perfect, I walk 6-10 miles a day, this shoe is super light weight and comfortable is and understatement."
Adidas,4,"I don’t normally write reviews for shoes but these are some really lightweight and comfortable shoes!  Like wearing a foamy sock shoe or walking on a cloud.

I bought these to do lightweight training (think weight machines and HIIT workouts in). They are the lightest and softest athletic shoes I’ve ever owned.

That being said, personally, I wouldn’t go outdoor running, hiking or any hard core or intense workouts/sports with these shoes as there’s not much ankle, arch or foot support. Plus the laces of the shoe are just for show versus offering security as it’s truly a slip on shoe. This is where I dinged the 5th star. A true option to be able to adjust the tightness of the laces would be nice.

However, using these shoes on a gym stair climber or elliptical machine? Absolutely. Walking around a city all day or using it as a vacation travel shoe? I can see that. I plan on using these for the latter so I’ll try to update to see how they hold up!"
Adidas,4,"I dont think you should use these for anything other than walking and more cushion in your shoe. I love them. They look gorgeous on my feet but I do not use them for running, there are better shoes for that.
I work as a paraprofessional with special education kiddos, so I am on my feet a lot and I have been loving these."
Adidas,4,"I feel like these are messed up versions of the real thing. The left shoe is perfect. It fits well and is super comfortable. The right shoe is where I have the issue. It’s so tight around the middle of my foot. It starts to cut the circulation off in my toes and then I have to take it off for a little while. I checked the box and the shoes and they all state the size that I ordered. I’ve been wearing them for a few days now thinking I needed to break them in, but it’s still way too tight on my right foot."
Adidas,4,I felt like these shoes were not meant for running outdoors. I provided little support against the impact of running outside. It is a cute pair of shoes for walking.
Adidas,4,I find the shoe to run a little large. Can't really say I'd use it to work out hard in. But is great for walking or yoga. Lightweight and doesn't seem to rub on my bunions. That's a big win for me!
Adidas,4,I found that these shoes ran really small because of the cushion on the insole. I am always a size 6 and had to reorder these in a 6.5
Adidas,4,I got a 9 ½ and they fit perfectly. I got these to pop on for errands and shopping they slip on easy and look good in leggings
Adidas,4,I got them for my mom for Mother’s Day and she fell in love with them.
Adidas,4,"I got these for walking shoes. They don't have as much padding as I would think, with the name Cloudfoam. It's fairly thin, which I did read from another review and probably should have listened. Overall, they're very comfortable. The only problem I have with them is if I walk like 2 or more miles, the ball of my foot starts to hurt, I think from lack of padding. This is an issue for me in a lot of shoes, so I could just be over sensitive but I was hoping they'd be good for more distance. Other than the ball of my foot, the rest is super comfy - I also end up having a lot of issues with the heel rubbing on shoes (I think I have really sensitive feet!), but these don't bother my heels at all. They're also super cute! So for the price, I'm gonna keep them and they'll get use, but if you need a good distance walking shoe these may not be the best choice."
Adidas,4,I had the black and white ones for a VERY long time and I ran in them and worked out in them as well. I lost one of the shoes and got another pair because I like them a lot. They’re good for pregnant women and they’re also good for running to me.
Adidas,4,"I hate buying clothes and shoes online, but the reviews were good so I did it! I actually love them so much I want them in another color! The only con I have is the way that the shoes were sewn on the Inside, sometimes I can feel it. Other than that, I love them! The adidas writing already has worn and is almost completely gone on the inside."
Adidas,4,"I have a pair of these shoes I wore out and I ordered a second pair to replace them because they are so comfortable and easy to slip on to wear for every day.  I have a wide foot due to a bunion and the stretchy material on the top in a regular width easily accommodated it.  Unfortunately, the new pair in the same size was narrower/tighter, so I returned them.  My first pair was purchased at Nordstrom Rack.  I don't know why purchasing the second pair on Amazon would make a difference, but it did.  Someone with a regular width foot would probably find them comfortable.  I put 2 stars for ""working out"" because I do not believe they provide the proper support for working out.  These shoes are awesome for every day, but I purchased more expensive running shoes for working out because running shoes provide the proper cushioning for impact and support for arches and side to side motion."
Adidas,4,I have a wide foot.  The very comfortable soleis way more narrow than the shoe
Adidas,4,"I have had foot surgery (navicular bone) a few years ago and have a tough time finding shoes that are supportive and still appropriate to wear to work. While I do like how “fluffy” and cushioned these shoes are, it does not seem like the sole is wide enough. I have never been the one to need wide shoes, which is why this surprised me so much. Nonetheless, these shoes are still comfortable and do their job. I do not need to lace them up constantly; they are easy to slip on and off which is quite convenient."
Adidas,4,I have the white pair if the same shoes and they fit me perfectly. I ordered the same size in this shoes and they are a little tight and could have gone 1/2 size up. Not sure why the sizing is off??
Adidas,4,I have thin feet plus flat feet. So didn't work for me. I couldn't make them tight. Had to return them.
Adidas,4,I have this exact shoe in 3 colors. I ordered just 9 1/2 not narrow- not wide but still they fit so much more narrow than my other two pair.
Adidas,4,"I have wide feet, so these shoes fit me a bit narrow. I normally wear a size 10, but sized up to an 11 and they fit pretty comfortably. I probably won’t wear them to work out in, but I wear them all the time for daily errands."
Adidas,4,"I like Adidas running shoes they are soft and comfortable. Unfortunately, I sent back my first pair in size 10 ( I am wearing size 10) because they were too big. Now I ordered one size down, size 9 and they fit. I will request a refund because they are tight and flat. I need more support for my hills. Wearing them at home for just 20 minutes gave me pain in my lower back. I gave 4 stars for quality material, but not for the fit and comfort."
Adidas,4,I like the look of these a lot. They run small. I am between an 8.5 and a 9. Even the 9 feels a bit snug but they are comfortable. Definitely buy a size up if you’re an “in-between sizes“ girl like me. Zero arch supports in these so I had to insert some that I have for another pair of running shoes. Very lightweight.
Adidas,4,"I like the shoes. They are comfortable and came at a good price and therefore I would buy again. I would definitely not do any heaving running or exercise in these shoes as the padding isn’t that thick but they are still comfy. Also, the package the shoes came in was all smashed and looked used but the shoes themselves were fine."
Adidas,4,I like these shoes but I expected more support.
Adidas,4,I like these shoes. The support isn’t fantastic for hikes or any type of natural terrain. But i use them when running errands or at work (i work in home health). They are super comfortable and durable. I’ve been using them for about a year now and theres barely any wear and tear.
Adidas,4,"I liked everything about this shoe......its color,  its fabric design, fit and comfort.
However, I had to send back because my heel area was just too thin for that built up back flap styling and was just too loose. I have, however, ordered another style in the Adidas brand."
Adidas,4,"I love how comfortable these shoes are! Super cute as well! The only down side is that they are a little bit big, and seem to stretch the more you wear them. I would size down!!!"
Adidas,4,"I love how light these shoes are on my feet. I’m a runner and they are great in aspects on airiness, however the shoe runs big. I normally wear a 7 and the 7 in these shoes feel super loose."
Adidas,4,"I love how these look, they’re super light weight and clean. But they feel more like compression shoes, or maybe thick house slippers (?) as the tongue doesn’t open so you just have to wedge your foot in
I was actually hoping they’d stretch a little bit but after 9+ hours of wearing them at work, they’re just as snug as when I left the house this morning. I only paid $20 so not a big loss. But I wouldn’t have kept them if they were more"
Adidas,4,"I love how these shoes look. I bought them primarily to wear to the gym. I’ve worn them maybe 10 times, and they are so slippery. I couldn’t do any exercises at the gym without my feet sliding. I’ll keep them because they’re comfortable but not practical for an active lifestyle."
Adidas,4,I love that you can slip these shoes on and don't have to worry about a tongue. They are super comfortable and bouncy. They're cute too!
Adidas,4,"I love the color because it’ll go with almost anything. They’re very comfortable, but I wear a size 5 & feel like they run a little big."
Adidas,4,"I love the cushioned insoles. I work on my feet and they are all day comfortable, but I do not like how tight the fit is around my ankles. They are not traditional lace up sneakers so there is no way to loosen them."
Adidas,4,I love the look of these shoes.  The memory foam soles makes them very comfortable.  I will say it did take a few wears for me to get used to the “tongue” area of the shoe.  It’s not an actual tongue so I was quite stiff which hurt the top of my foot but after wearing them a couple of times I no longer have that problem.
Adidas,4,"I love the look of these shoes. They are comfortable and the sole is very think/cushion-y. I also think they're a bit wider than expected bc my foot moves around slightly when walking, even though I have them tightened as much as possible. Overall, great shoes."
Adidas,4,I love the memory foam sole and I have had such a hard time finding a shoe that I can wear for long periods of time and not make my feet hurt because of my flat feet. These shoes are amazing and so extremely comfortable.
Adidas,4,I love the shoe. Comfortable and versatile. The only thing is that it’s a little big. I’m usually a size 10 and when I received it there’s extra room. Due to the process of online returning I’m going to keep them but my advice would be to size down half a size. Will get another pair in a 9 1/2 and see.
Adidas,4,"I love the shoe. Its comfortable, light and fits as expected. Only downside is that its more of a slip on shoe than an actual lace up shoe. There is no tongue and the laces are pretty much pointless, they do not control how tight or loose your shoe is. You kind of have to just hope that your foot will fit into the hole and that what little stretch the shoe allows will be enough to get it on. Its impossible to get on with anything thicker than an ankle sock."
Adidas,4,"I love the shoes, but they are looser than I would like.  Also, can find these now at Costco for $30."
Adidas,4,"I love the style of the shoe and it’s really cute and breathable. I would say the support is average but it hasn’t been a problem for me. My only issue is that I think the shoes *run* a little big. I am usually a 7 1/2 but I needed a 7 in these shoes. However, once I got the right size I was very happy."
Adidas,4,"I love the way these fit. They are so comfortable. I wear these on days when I’m
going to be on my feet a lot. I do not recommend these for running, as there is no ankle support or cushion. They are great for just running errands, walking, or cycling."
Adidas,4,I love these shoes so comfy! I’ve been warring to work
Adidas,4,I love these shoes! I put them on the first time thinking I will break them in and they were instantly super comfortable and continue to be so! I also have recieved many compliments as well!!
Adidas,4,"I love these shoes, I’m on my feet all day long and they are really comfy."
Adidas,4,"I LOVE these shoes, they are cute and lightweight. My only qualm with these shoes is that they are slightly large. With a thicker pair of socks, they are more secure. However, I occasionally find myself a little tripped up in these shoes because they're just a smidge too big. I usually wear a 6.5 to 7 in Adidas, I purchased a 6.5 for reference."
Adidas,4,"I LOVE these shoes, they are lightweight and so comfortable. But they wore out after owning them for two months. Granted, I wear them pretty much every day and take hour long walks... so maybe they are supposed to be worn out by now but I wish they’d last longer. It’s the only reason I rated them 4 stars."
Adidas,4,"I love these shoes, they are pretty comfortable. Though I would suggest if you have a chance to try them on first I would. I believe I should of went down a size."
Adidas,4,"I love these shoes. They are so cute and I can wear them with almost any outfit and they’re really stylish. They also a very comfortable and very light weight. They’re not the quickest to get on and they don’t have a lot of arch support, which I need for my feet but I still wear them every day. I would get them in another color! Good price too."
Adidas,4,"I love these shoes. They are super comfy, slip on and off easily and great for everyday wear to the store and chasing my toddler around. Personally they dont give me enough support for running, I love Asics for a running shoe. But I definitely recommend them for every day wear."
Adidas,4,I love these sneakers but after a month of running with them outside they lost support and had a big hole under the ball of the foot. They're not meant for running every day outside unfortunately. I previously had another pair that lasted longer because I was running on the treadmill instead.
Adidas,4,"I love these! There run a little bit. I'm a true size 8. I could have gone down to a 7.5, very roomy and really comfortable."
Adidas,4,I love this shoe. It’s extremely comfortable but also stylish. I normally wear an 8 but went with a 7 on these shoes so I recommend sizing down.
Adidas,4,"I love this shoes, they are very comfortable and lightweight.
The colors on the shoes in person aren't exactly like on the website, colors are lighter, not the deep rich colors on the pics on here but to me that's not a big deal."
Adidas,4,I love those shoes for about the first month. I do a lot of walking with my job (about 5-7 miles 5 days a week). My feet were so sore with all of the other shoes I tried. I have repurchased this shoe multiple occasions because of how comfortable they are and I have yet for find another shoe as comfortable. The don’t last for me more than about 2 months with the amount of walking I do in a daily basis. I walk on concrete floors all day and it provides cushion.
Adidas,4,I need to purchase a second pair...
Adidas,4,I needed a new pair of tennis shoes and these fit the bill. They are very comfy yet practical and fashionable. They fit true to size. The only reason I didn’t give them 5 stars is because they make your feet look really long.
Adidas,4,I normally wear a size 9 but after reading reviews I purchased 9 1/2. They fit tight and the fabric is very thin so you see the outline of my toes. The bottom cushion is medium to thin. They were not the most expensive but will not recommend. Sorry
Adidas,4,"I ordered a 7.5, my usual size, and it was way too big. Returned and deciding if I want to try a smaller size. The shoe looked great but I did not realize that it is a slip on and not a lace up."
Adidas,4,"I ordered not 1, not 2, but 3 pairs of Adidas shoes before I realized they run a full size or more larger than Nikes. I'm an 8 in Nike but I ended up being a 7 in these. It took trying Adidas sizes 8, 7.5, and 7. Even with the 7 I felt like I might even like a 6.5. Maybe this is something that is just general knowledge but I was very surprised. After the sizing issue was resolved for me (thank god for Amazon's generous return policy btw) I really liked these shoes. The Cloudfoam is unlike any other and the color is gorgeous. I've gotten a few compliments on these already and I have been using them to run in and they seem to be giving me plenty of support. Overall, I do really like the shoes. Great quality for a great price!"
Adidas,4,"I ordered these for my daughter and had to send the first pair back as they were too small. All shoes and brands run different so it is no biggie, but I would suggest checking the measurements and possibly ordering up a size. They are very light weight and comfy and the colors match mostly anything. Great shoes."
Adidas,4,"I ordered two pairs of these same size one black, one gray. The black were too tight at the laces (which can be tightened but not loosened as it's all one piece where the tongue would be.) The grey were perfect! They are very comfortable. I could have exchanged but I just gave the black ones to my daughter and she loves them too!  I go between size 8 & 8.5 and I ordered size 8."
Adidas,4,"I purchased these for work shoes. The memory foam is nice but I feel like it has worn down faster than it should have. Overall, they are a great looking shoe and are very comfy!"
Adidas,4,I read the other reviews that said runs big. Not true. I had to return for my normal size 8 1/2
Adidas,4,"I really like how comfortable these shoes are. I use them for clinicals where I am on my feet all day and at the end of the day, my feet definitely hurt less than other shoes that I have tried."
Adidas,4,I really like my shoes. They are very comfortable and very light weight. They arrived on time thanks Amazon !!
Adidas,4,I really like the fitting of these shoes. Easy to glide in your shoes and comfortable in running. It is not water proof and water seeps in if you wear it during a rainy day.
Adidas,4,I really like the shoe but its not for every day work. This shoe works best for me as a casual shoe since work is more on the go. Fits great and was true to size. Thinking about getting another pair before I can not find them anymore.
Adidas,4,I really like the shoes for just casual day wear. But I definitely would not work out in them they don't provide the same support. My size 8  Is a little loose but nothing that would make me return them.
Adidas,4,I really like these shoes they are very comfortable. My only complaint and reason for not giving 5 stars is they are hard to get on. The opening doesn’t stretch or open any further.
Adidas,4,I really like these shoes. They have a lot of cushion and I have run a couple of times in them but I am not sure how long they will last as my every day running shoes. They are super easy to slip on without untying.
Adidas,4,I really like these; however I think my feet are a bit skinny. There was a big gap between the shoe and my top arch so I didn’t keep them. But overall I think they would be great for most people.
Adidas,4,"I really like this sneaker.  It’s my second pair.  They don’t last long,but I feel the price is right to replace them more frequently."
Adidas,4,I really love how comfortable they are but they look a bit too long. I’d advise probably going down a size.
Adidas,4,"I really love these shoes and originally bought them in black in a size 9 (my normal size). They were a little big and of course have stretched just a bit. So I decided to get another pair in a different color and in a half size smaller. When I got them, they were labeled correctly as an 8.5 but when I put them on they felt exactly the same as my original size 9. When I hold the two sizes up to each other they are exactly the same size. So I’m a bit confused. I’m going to keep this second pair, but I am wondering if they just came from different manufacturers? So if you decide to get these I would recommend going a half size down. Although, I guess it doesn’t seem to matter. LOL"
Adidas,4,I really love these shoes but definitely size down!!! They come really really big! I'm 5'1 and 170lbs size 7 shoe and they were HUGE so I sent them back. The quality and style are beautiful so I give them 4 stars! 1 star off for fitting too big!
Adidas,4,"I received the sneakers today and were more on the white side of grey, but look very nice.  I have a high arch and issues with plantar fasciitis.  These shoes feel super cushiony but nowhere near any sort of arch support.  I will need to wear some inserts so I can walk without pain."
Adidas,4,"I sized down a half size as I do in all adidas shoes. I feel these are a little narrow, but they have a stretchy knit top so they work."
Adidas,4,I stand a lot for work and this is a comfortable shoe! Great cushioning. I’ve had for a couple of months and still feel great. Super lightweight too! Decent price as well. Would buy again.
Adidas,4,"I stinking love these shoes!!

I started working out 6 weeks ago and bought these shoes from Amazon. I never had heard of them before and I crossed my fingers and hit purchase.

They arrived. I was impressed.

To be fair, I was terrified that they would be like all the other shoes I buy that just cut away at my heel and blisters. They don't! The heel area feel like a velvet type material so there's no scraping when walking or running.

They've been holding up well. I love how breathable they are. I work out in them and I don't wear socks. My shoes nor my feet are stinky from working out and hanging out in the sauna. I wish there was a tiny bit more support: ie better insole. But I can just buy one.

I ordered a size 9. In Uggs and Toms I wear a 9, some other shoes a 8.5. These fit perfectly and don't suffocate my feet.

Definitely plan to buy more colors when the price goes down"
Adidas,4,"I typically am a 6.5 but seeing everyone’s comments and amazon recommended the 6, it ended up being a little tight. I should of kept my normal size, besides the “as expected to be normal” fit, shoes are really cute and love the look. I agree with the other comments that it isn’t a running shoe but great to wear when doing errands/lifestyle shoe!"
Adidas,4,I use these for everyday since they are very light and comfortable.  I don't think they have enough support or cushion for running but they work great for just everyday.
Adidas,4,"i use these for running, walking and hitt workouts.  very comfortable.  i do have to use a shoehorn to put them on with socks, since there isn't a tongue to loosen."
Adidas,4,I usually wear 6 1/2 but when i read the reviews i decided to order 6 and they fit perfectly. They are the most comfortable tennis shoes i have ever worn and i really love them. I took off one star because I have only had them for about a week so i am not sure how these shoes hold up long term but i love them now!
Adidas,4,I usually wear a 7 1/2 in Nike. So based on reviews I ordered a 7. I should have stuck with the 7 1/2.
Adidas,4,I was disappointed because it appeared to have laces that did not need tying. My shoes have to
Adidas,4,I was looking for a pair of athleisure sneakers for just going out of the house. These are truly perfect and so comfy. I rated 4 stars because they are listed as running shoes but I would not recommend running in them. They seem as though they would wear out quickly and wouldn't support your feet properly for that. Otherwise they are great.
Adidas,4,"I was super excited for these shoes to come in the mail, even more excited that they were coming a day early. When i got them in the mail i was kinda confused they came in an amazon bag and not a box. The bag was crushed and from the pictures you can see the show box was crushed too. I was super nervous to open the box, but the shoes were  not damaged a bit! Im so glad i decided to order these shoes. Im giving them 4 stars because of they should have been packaged better for the $60 i spent. But the shoes themselves are super comfy and perfect!!"
Adidas,4,I was surprised how lightweight the shoes were but still providing good support. Good walking shoe for summer.
Adidas,4,I wear 6.5 and these were very loose.  The opening your foot goes into is a little tight but they stay secure on your feet and they were great walking around in Disney World for a week.  Never had to re-tie the laces
Adidas,4,"I wear an 8.5, but ordered these in a 9. They fit somewhat like the 8.5 I tried on in a department store."
Adidas,4,I wear these to the gym. Very comfortable and lightweight but with just enough support.
Adidas,4,"I went an entire size down and they now fit great. It was snug at first, but nothing like walking around the block can't fix.

I wear these on days that I'm constantly walking around campus. They don't hurt my feet at all."
Adidas,4,I would have given these shoes 5 stars however they are a little on the narrow side. The material is giving so they do allow for a wider foot to fit. I purchased these to use as my everyday work shoes.
Adidas,4,"I would have preferred a wide width, otherwise fits good! Very comfortable and very cute!"
Adidas,4,"I’m a housekeeper for a hotel and I needed decent shoes to work in. The padding is very comfortable, however, they are a tad tight. I would recommend going a size bigger than your own."
Adidas,4,I’m a nurse and need shoes that are comfortable after 12+ hrs of being on my feet. These fit great and so far have still been comfortable after long shifts.
Adidas,4,I’m usually a size 7.5 or 8. I ordered a size 8 and they’re a little big. Super comfortable and light weight!!
Adidas,4,If you have diabetes or fibromyalgia these are the shoes for you!!! They are wonderful for neuropathy!!! Like walking on sunshine plus you can not go wrong purchasing Adidas!!! Don't give it a second thought just purchase them!! you will not regret it!!
Adidas,4,If you have wide feet maybe order size up
Adidas,4,"I'm a typical size 8, and I have a moderate bunion on my right foot.  These shoes have been great in my workouts and comfortable for all day wear.  A little play in the arch when I'm lifting weights, which is the only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5."
Adidas,4,"I'm glad I bought these. They look good and are overall comfy. They are a little tight and pretty slim, so I would avoid if you have wider feet."
Adidas,4,"I'm typically a true size 9 but this shoe was too long and simultaneously somewhat narrow.
It looks cool and its easy to slip on and off."
Adidas,4,"In almost all shoe brands I am a size 7, I needed a 6.5 in these shoes. Other than the sizing issue, I exchanged, I absolutely love these shoes! So light weight yet comfortable!"
Adidas,4,"Inexpensive.  Can be used for walking, running."
Adidas,4,"It is a good pair of sneakers, good quality, great aesthetic. Are they comfortable? Yes. Are they a pair of sneakers I would recommend that you buy? No. For me, these are not that great and I definitely would not purchase another pair."
Adidas,4,"It’s a bit hard to push through maybe cause it’s new
Overall it’s a nice sneaker.
But the picture look nicer than the actual shoe."
Adidas,4,It’s a pair of comfortable shoes!!
Adidas,4,"It’s a really cute shoe that I can wear with athletic gear or a pair of jeans. I usually wear an 8.5. Based on reviews, I ordered an 8. With no socks or thin, no shows, they are very comfortable. With my thicker, standard socks I’d wear in other gym shoes, they are a bit snug."
Adidas,4,"It’s comfortable but seems flimsy, when I put them on I hear cracking in the material."
Adidas,4,Item was not for me so can't give any reviews
Adidas,4,"It's cute but it was too big for me. I ordered size 5.5 but it was too big for me. However, it probably is just my fault because I wear between sizes 4-5.5"
Adidas,4,"Its nice, but its a bit tight on my gf's feet!"
Adidas,4,Its very supportive and comfortable when working out. It really helps when I'm running
Adidas,4,I've been wearing Nike's for years but decided to try these Adidas because I liked the style. I normally wear a size 7 1/2 shoe but always bought size 8 in Nikes to accommodate for socks and my feet swelling a bit during exercise. I had to return and get a size 7 1/2 for length of the sole. They are still loose around the ankle so I have to tie then super tight.  Cute shoe though and the price was right!
Adidas,4,I've walked 2.5 km in these shoes so far and it was a great walk. usually shoes leave my feet feeling strained but i didnt experience this here. my only complaint is that the moth of the shoes is abit small so i was worried i got it smaller than i needed but once you get it on your foot its perfect!
Adidas,4,"Just a little loose, but otherwise it will be a great workshop for me."
Adidas,4,"Just what I was looking for. Cute, comfortable and slip on. These don't provide much support and I wouldn't suggest them for any real exercise, but they are perfect to throw on for a quick walk or errand."
Adidas,4,Light weight and very comfortable. It is a slip on shoe with laces. I was afraid it would slip off but doesn't. I'll buy them again.
Adidas,4,"Lightweight and comfortable as a running/athletic shoe or as a lifestyle sneaker. Love the color of the shoe. Never know what to expect when I purchase pink clothing or shoes online. They often don't have the same tone as I think they will based on the image. Fortunately, these are just as they appeared in the picture - a natural, neutral pink. Very happy."
Adidas,4,Like them. Pretty comfortable shoe. Looks good to.
Adidas,4,Like these shoes but noticed they are squeaky especially when I walked on shinny floor at the supermarket . It was a Loud squeak pretty embarrassing . Overall it’s a comfy shoe .
Adidas,4,Liked so much I bought twice. Great look. Only for wearing to run errands. Not a shoe for workouts
Adidas,4,"Literally the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. If I could change one thing it would be that the bottom of the shoes wears out pretty fast if you’re using it outside, like running on pavement. These are great for working out in a gym!"
Adidas,4,"Little wider than anticipated, but I also have narrow width. Not as cushiony as other Adidas Cloudfoam soles. Certainly a good shoe, but wouldn’t purchase for running or plyometrics. Good walking shoe"
Adidas,4,Look cute with leggings. I can’t image running in them. Not much arch support.
Adidas,4,look good & feel better not much support  Great for touristing casual but not clunky
Adidas,4,"Looks good, warm - tab kinda bugs my Achilles tendon without socks"
Adidas,4,"Love love love them, waiting for a sale to buy more!! I already have 2 pair!!"
Adidas,4,"Love love love, they fit true to size I was worried about that because of some reviews but I wear 7.5 orders 7.5 and they fit perfect. I love that you don’t have to really tie the shoe because it’s a slip on type nice fit they are comfortable definitely will be buying this shoe in more colors!"
Adidas,4,Love the color and look but they run big. Size down.
Adidas,4,Love the color and the fit. I won't be using them for running though. Not enough memory foam in the soles. Great for walking and as an everyday sneaker.
Adidas,4,Love the look of these shoes! They have great comfort. My only complaint is the piece in the back comes up really high and rubs on my ankle.
Adidas,4,Love the quality and comfort of these shoes. They are a tad narrow in the toe base with very little arch support so they are not for everyone but they are super cute with a pair of jeans or in my case with scrubs. I had to send mine back for smaller ones though because they run large. I ordered a full size down in the end.
Adidas,4,Love the shoes. 4 stars because I thought I was ordering navy but they are teal.  I’ll keep them because I do like them. Color is misleading in the photo though.
Adidas,4,Love the style and fit. Just what I was looking for in comfort to do my jogging around the park.
Adidas,4,"Love the way the shoe looks super cute but had to put foam insole in the to make them wearable for all day walking at work!! The company needs to rethink their idea of cloud foam and look at whatever Sketchers uses, but over all I love the shoes 👟 with my new insoles in them and I’d buy them again! ( the insoles weren’t that expensive!!)  and I get lots of compliments on them ✅"
Adidas,4,Love them
Adidas,4,"Love them. Comfy and cute for casual wear. I wear a 9 in all other athletic brands but Adidas I wear 8.5.
I wouldn't suggest working out in them, the support and sole is not designed for that."
Adidas,4,Love them. Light weight and comfy. Will buy again
Adidas,4,Love these but the tab on the back gets the cuff of your pants stuck on it.
Adidas,4,"Love these shoes but they’re kind of “tall” (I.e. lots of space between the top of my foot and the shoelaces area of the shoe. So I have to tie the shoelaces so tight that it makes the shoe dimple. But length is correct, so I can’t go down a size"
Adidas,4,Love these shoes just forgot to size a half size down.
Adidas,4,Love these shoes! They are so cute and comfortable! They run slightly big but besides that I really like them!
Adidas,4,"Love these shoes, however they were shipped with the alarm tag still attached. Had to macgyver a way to remove it without the ink well in the tag spilling all over the shoe."
Adidas,4,"Love these shoes, the only downside I have found is that the tread wears down fairly quickly at an average of 20K step a day they last about 3 months before they start to get noticeably thin."
Adidas,4,Love these shoes. Casual but stylish and easy to slip on.
Adidas,4,Love these shoes. Cute and comfortable. Very much a slip on shoe for running around doing errands and such. The only thing I didn't love was I ordered the white and they are much more blue looking than I anticipated. Would definitely buy again!
Adidas,4,"Love these sneakers for daily wear. Extremely light and comfortable. Not sure how they would hold up for running or daily long walking but for normal daily wear, they are GREAT!"
Adidas,4,"Love these sneakers... cute, stylish and comfortable. I’m usually a size 9... in every single shoe. This one was a bit big and I could’ve gone with an 8.5"
Adidas,4,"Love this Adidas shoe, this is my second pair. I love the style and look with casual spring and summer outfits. They are very comfortable and supportive for casual wear."
Adidas,4,Love this shoe.  So comfy and lightweight.  It is a bit big as the laces are not able to be tightened much
Adidas,4,Love this tennis shoes very comfortable it looks gray skirts shorts pants casual dressy sporty. Would’ve been perfect with a little more support but otherwise great Sneakers
Adidas,4,Love!
Adidas,4,"Loved the look of this shoe, but not as cushy as expected. On a scale of 1 to 10 regarding style, I would say a 10. On a scale of 1 to 10 on comfort, I would say a 7 (average comfort). The shoe is extremely lightweight and has a thin layer of foam which was hardly noticeable in the ball of the foot. This could be seen as an pro as a light weight shoe for traveling or casual wear.  I bought these hoping for a cushy running shoe, but did not use for running because the padding was so thin on the sole compared to my Nikes and Brooks.  Heel did have padding, but still very light on the padding compared to a traditional “running shoe.” Ball of foot and toe area, little padding.  I run anywhere between 1.5-4 miles 3-5 times per week and will also walk 1-2 miles on other days. The shoe provided more than adequate comfort for walking several miles and did well while walking miles upon miles in Europe. I did not have sore feet! So style was perfect, but comfort for any running activity beyond extensive walking may require a more heavily padded shoe especially if you desire arch support. I did use with arch supports in Europe and found the shoe to be a complete success in meeting my needs for 50miles if walking in 5 days. Again, shoe held up for miles of walking and was comfortable with arch support inserts."
Adidas,4,Loved them at first but the cloud foam wore down pretty quickly but for $35 I can’t complain to much. Got tons of compliments on them.
Adidas,4,"Luv this shoe!I got it for my daughter. You would want to size down, they run a size or 2 big."
Adidas,4,More cheaply made but super comfortable. Also- it’s not necessarily gray. It’s Black & white that make it look gray when not up close. Wish I would’ve known that.
Adidas,4,"Most people probably knew that these were not made for running on unpaved roads. I did not, and this was why I bought running shoes. I don't find them super comfortable for this reason. About halfway through my run, my feet begin to ache. However, when I am on a blacktop surface, they feel fine. The fit is true to size, I am a 9 in every shoe I own, and that rang true here as well. I like the lace design, I just wish there was a *little* more support."
Adidas,4,Muy bueno
Adidas,4,My 12 yo daughter loves them! She says they are very form fitting but comfortable so they are good for running.
Adidas,4,My daughter deals with discomfort in her knees and these sneakers brought almost instant relief to her.  They were true to size too.  We are a normal paying customer.  They look to both of us and felt to her much more than what they cost.
Adidas,4,My daughter really likes
Adidas,4,"My doctor's nurse had a pair like this, and told me they were very comfortable. She's on her feet a lot. I took her word for it, and they are quite comfortable."
Adidas,4,"My favorite adidas shoe, this is my second pair in a different color. Very comfortable and light weight. Walked 10 miles a day in Europe and had no aches from wearing them."
Adidas,4,"My granddaughter loves these shoes.  This is her second pair.
She received them for Christmas.
I wish they were priced more reasonable."
Adidas,4,My only wish is that the foam was thicker in the shoe.
Adidas,4,"My son said they are narrow in width, toe box is good, durability and appearance are great!"
Adidas,4,Nice
Adidas,4,Nice and light! Very comfy shoe!! Love them!! Packing was messed up and box looked like someone tried to take them. The only thing I was dissatisfied about.
Adidas,4,Nice comfortable shoe except they run big...order half or size down.
Adidas,4,"Nice comfy shoes, seem well-made however they do run big. I am usually a 7 1/2 which is what I ordered and there is a good inch at the toe. A size 7 would have been perfect. The shoes do not have much support, feel much like house shoes. Will be great for every day use but not for athletics"
Adidas,4,"Nice looking shoes, just runs way too large. I ordered a size down and they’re still too big."
Adidas,4,"Nice shoe, i vary between 7 and 7,5 because of a wider foot, these were loose on, so I returned."
Adidas,4,Nice shoes but the foot padding is thin and after a while my feet hurt. Now I am on the heavier side so they may be more comfortable for someone else.
Adidas,4,"Nice shoes, wasn't the size I ordered but we're able to regift."
Adidas,4,"No structure to these shoes. It’s fabric not like regular shoes. Very comfortable. Odd to lace up (laces are pointless actually). They run a little big. Can’t say I’d wear these to run or workout,
Maybe lifting but no HIIT or jumping. More like casual sneakers. Would buy again for fashion"
Adidas,4,"Normally a size 6.5 in womens. I sized up to a 7, rather the shoes be a little big than to be too small to wear. They were still pretty tight when I first got them which caused my feet to hurt and be sore even when I was doing nothing but sitting. Eventually they did get worn-in and loosen up to fit much better."
Adidas,4,Not a great shoe for running but so far snug and comfortable for walking and yoga. Wear a size 5 and ordered the same a seems true to fit
Adidas,4,Not much support around the ankles.
Adidas,4,"Not really an athletic shoe, nice to romp around in."
Adidas,4,"Ok, but they squeak like crazy on the treadmill (only use it for walking speed)
Als,  my ankle rubs against the shoe... have to cover with socks which makes them look dorky."
Adidas,4,Only gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars because of the stripe starting to come off. Super bummed and not worth my time to send back. I will try something to glue it back down. This was putting them on for the first time too. Only a couple hours worn at the time I noticed it!
Adidas,4,Only negative is the shoelaces come loose if not tied very firmly. They are a textured nylon flat lace vs a traditional cotton lace. They have very nice lace ends/aiglets though. Overall nice shoes.
Adidas,4,Order a half size smaller.
Adidas,4,"Over all great shoes, when you first wear them it tends to rub on the back of your ankle but once they are worn it, feels great! They do stain easily as well."
Adidas,4,Overall shoes were great. I’m usually a size 8 in all my sneakers for some reason this were huge on me. To long and wide over my feet. I guess order a half size down
Adidas,4,"Overall the shoe is what I was looking for, but the delivery of my package was REDICULOUS!!!!!"
Adidas,4,Overall these are very comfortable. They are about a half size too big but I was too lazy to return. Size down.
Adidas,4,perfect
Adidas,4,Perfect fit and great price
Adidas,4,"Precious!! They are a bit snug but not uncomfortable. After 2 weeks & 3 wears, the plastic piece on one shoe lace broke off."
Adidas,4,"Pretty comfy, pretty cute. True to size. However. The memory foam on the inside stops short of the full shoe, so my toes hang over slightly. Not enough to return, but may bug some people. My biggest issue is that the left shoe is wider than the right—and no, it’s not wide and the other regular. It’s just how it’s made. Lining them up on each other, it’s probably about a half inch wider (.25” on either side). I don’t think it’s reason enough to return, but it does bother me. That’s where the 4 stars come in. For the memory foam, and the differences in width even though they should be the same. You can kind of see the difference in the picture.

Other than that, they are cute and comfy, and good enough to what I wanted them for—walking the dogs around the neighborhood or running errands. Overall, I’d buy again."
Adidas,4,"Pretty great quality for the price, but does run a tiny bit on the larger size. I'm usually a 7.5 but the 7 works with socks."
Adidas,4,"Pretty in person. Colors are nicely balanced. I have wider feet so they are a bit difficult to get on (the entrance is not adjustable; think of a form-fitting slip-on shoe). Once you're in though, they're comfy all over and super light. These probably best fit average - wide feet.

I would be cautious on ordering if:
-you have a difficult time putting on shoes
-if you have VERY narrow or EXTRA wide feet"
Adidas,4,Probably one of my favorite pairs of shoes I have ever owned. Only down side is the sole is almost gone on both pairs of these in about 8 months of owning them. I have two pairs because they are that comfortable but wish they made the soles rubber instead of foam.
Adidas,4,"Pros
-The insoles have a good bit of cushion depth
-Look great
-Fit as described (5.5w was correct to measurement)
-Easy to slip on
-Breathable
-Good for stability
-Competitively priced

Cons
-Outsole doesn't promote cushioning for running (no spring/ bounce/ support).
-Outsole is a lower quality material, that will not last longer than a year, if that.
-Shoelaces aren't the stretchy type"
Adidas,4,"Really comfy shoe, feels like a literal cloud on my feet. Wish this came in a wide option, my foot hangs off the sole on the interior a little bit when I walk. Also, not the greatest for long, long walks. Would be ideal for leisurely walks or amusement park days, etc.

Really love the look and feel of them though!"
Adidas,4,Really comfy wish they were a half inch bigger. Ordered a ten.
Adidas,4,"Really comfy.  I'm usually a 6.5, and I got a 6.5.  They definitely fit but they are a tad bit long.  I probably could have gone down a size but this size is in no way uncomfortable or annoying."
Adidas,4,"Really liked these shoes, but I wanted some that had a little more support around the ankles."
Adidas,4,"Really love the look of these. I was nervous about the sizing because everyone said they run big. I got a size 8, which is my normal size and it fits comfortably. The material is very stretchy so it can be a tad roomy in the toe area, but it gets the job done. On a side note, it did not come in an original adidas box."
Adidas,4,Runs a little bigger than other style Adidas. Love the color. And they are so comfy!!
Adidas,4,Runs a tad small. Didn’t realize the tongue of the shoe was set in place along with the laces. Support is pretty good but the top is uncomfortable.
Adidas,4,Runs big
Adidas,4,Runs big. Most all my shoes are an 8. So I bought these in an 8 and they were too big.
Adidas,4,Runs large. Wish I had ordered down a half of a size. I also wish it had more support. Other than that super cute and versatile!
Adidas,4,"Runs normal size for adidas which typically run larger than most tennis shoes. I wear a 6.5 in nikes but a 6 in adidas.

Super cute and light weight.

The only issue I have with mine is the tongue of the shoe is fake and can’t be adjusted so it can start to dig into your sheens."
Adidas,4,"Runs. a little big, but the smaller size didn't fit quite right either."
Adidas,4,Sending back because I didn’t realize the tongue of the shoe is fully connected to the side... I also thought it ran a bit narrow.
Adidas,4,She loved them!! They looked great! Other than the box it came it looked like someone tossed it down a mountain and let it fall and roll for hours!! Other than that the shoes was perfect
Adidas,4,"Shoe color perfect ..comfortable
But size a bit off im size 8 womans and it feel slighlty big .. other than that just perfect"
Adidas,4,"Shoe is comfy and easy to slip on and go, but not supportive enough for anything strenous."
Adidas,4,Shoes are comfortable. Thought it would have more padding inside though like it’s name. It’s still good though and I used it for 9 hour work days and haven’t had any issues
Adidas,4,Shoes are great but run big. Order half size down.
Adidas,4,"Shoes are in good/new condition, but this is how it arrived. Since shoes are fine, I’m ok with it. However, let’s try to handle our boxes more carefully! :)"
Adidas,4,"Shoes run a tad bit large for a 7 compared to my Nike trainers. They slipped off my foot while working out. They are comfortable for just walking around in, but not working out."
Adidas,4,Size down for sure but great sure for everyday but definitely not a shoe for working out purposes also v cute
Adidas,4,Sneaker fits true to size. The comfort is incredible!
Adidas,4,So comfortable and I’ll just throw them in the washing machine every so often. Good sneaker for the price!
Adidas,4,"So comfy and stylish! I have a hammertoe that makes it hard to find shoes don’t hurt but these are very comfortable! Love!! Extremely happy with my order! Update- I bought these in October and Unfortunately,  by January the soles wore out! But, I just ordered again bc they are  that comfortable!"
Adidas,4,"So cute and comfortable! Lots of compliments. Ordered my normal size 9. Too much room in the heel area. Ordered an 8 1/2 for a better fit. Perfect fit in the heel, but would have liked a little more room in the toe. That said, keeping the 8 1/2. Would order again- I really like them."
Adidas,4,So cute and comfy!!! They are quite wide but otherwise aesthetically very pretty. They do run a little big. I normally am a 7- 7 1/2 depending. Ended up getting the 7 but probably could have gotten a 6 1/2.
Adidas,4,"So for the price, I couldn’t pass up. Adidas Cloudfoam is SO comfortable and durable. They’re soft and easy to slip on. However, the laces don’t go as high so there isn’t as much support around the ankle. Since the shoes are lightweight, I wouldn’t suggest for training. I’ve played rec volleyball and the traction isn’t superb. But for an everyday sneaker, walking, or light running, these will do the trick."
Adidas,4,"So I was skeptical of how comfortable these shoes would be. I have foot problems and need cushion and support. I was pleasantly surprised with these. I really like how lightweight they are. I don’t wear them for anything high impact, mainly lifting weights. I actually bought them cuz they were on major sale and were in 12 women’s, which is hard to come by! Money well spent and I’d buy these in another color. I really like the slip on feature too."
Adidas,4,"So these sneakers are ADORABLE. Color is great. They are also very light and comfortable. However, I didn't give 5 stars because I found them to be quite wide. If you have thinner/bony feet, definitely get a half size smaller. I wish I would have! When I tie them, I have to pull the laces tighter for them to fit, which makes them bulge a bit and takes away from the streamlined look across the top of the shoe. I always wear a size 8 in Nike for reference."
Adidas,4,"Solid shoe but I definitely wouldn’t wear them for running more than like a mile. I go for a 30 minute (almost 2 mile) walk through my hilly neighborhood every day and by the end of it, my feet are usually hurting and oddly hotter than they are in other shoes. They’d probably be fine for things like weightlifting and other forms of strength training."
Adidas,4,Style great. Just a little tight in the front. Hopefully will stretch out. Cushioned well .
Adidas,4,"Stylish and comfortable. The ""tongue"" in the front is a bit long and irritates my foot if worn all day"
Adidas,4,"such a comfy shoe, have a pair in white too. the only thing is that the sole can get a small indentation from putting weight on them but it doesn't bother me at all."
Adidas,4,Super big but super confortable also
Adidas,4,Super comfortable
Adidas,4,Super comfortable and breath very well. The only thing I wasn’t happy about was there was a small spot on the top of one of the shoes. It was too much trouble to return so I kept them. But other than the spot I love the fit!
Adidas,4,Super comfortable and great deal!
Adidas,4,"Super comfortable and light, just run big. Should have gotten a half or maybe even full size smaller"
Adidas,4,Super comfortable but a slight bit large. I'm usually a 7.5 and it fits a little too big but I still wear it just with thicker socks to fill in extra toe space. Will buy another a half size down.
Adidas,4,Super comfortable but need to size down at least .5 maybe even whole size.
Adidas,4,"Super comfortable shoes!  Needed something with support for my pregnant, aching back and these feel great.  The only thing I don’t love is how high the tongue goes... it rubs against my ankle and starts hurting over time. I wear ankle socks with these."
Adidas,4,"Super comfortable! I’m a nurse on my feet all day, and having comfortable shoes makes such a difference in how I do my job. It’s like I’m walking on clouds, no joke! My only thing is, I wish the padding went all the way to the very tip of the shoe, not the middle of the toe. That’s my only critique, otherwise, I love them!"
Adidas,4,"Super comfortable. Can stand all day in these. However, the fit is a little large. Ordered my normal 6.5 and feel there is way too much room in the toe and the heel. Trying to decide if maybe thats a good thing for just standing all day - but definitely would size down if I wanted to try working out in these."
Adidas,4,Super comfy
Adidas,4,Super comfy and lightweight
Adidas,4,"Super comfy and lightweight.  I was looking for something mainly for dance classes without spending a ton. Good for working out, but I personally wouldn’t feel like they had enough support for running.  They do make my feet sweat more than my Nikes, I’m guessing due to the memory foam?? I wear these in the kitchen, for hip-hop classes and general working out."
Adidas,4,Super comfy and very lightweight! I want them in several colors now.
Adidas,4,"Super comfy but a little big around the ankles, but not bad."
Adidas,4,"Super comfy but lacking in support. I purchased for 4 day Disney parks trip. They required no breaking in, but they weren't as supportive as my Nike's. Great price and I'm sure they'll be great everyday shoes, when not walking 20k steps/ day."
Adidas,4,"Super comfy, but I needed additional support and had to purchase inserts for my arches."
Adidas,4,"Super comfy, cute, easily slips on. Exactly what I was looking for, though the it's a little roomy. Probably could have gone a half size down if I wanted a snug fit."
Adidas,4,"Super comfy, perfect for when I go to the theme parks"
Adidas,4,Super comfy. Fix as expected. Love em.
Adidas,4,"Súper cómodos para hacer ejercicios, buen ajustado, no incomodan para nada"
Adidas,4,Super cute and comfy but not quite enough support for the balls of my feet (I usually wear NB or Nike air’s so I didn’t think I needed much). First day wearing them all day and I had some pain at the end of the day.
Adidas,4,"Super cute and I love the ease of slip on shoes for around the house but they are not as fitted as other slip-ons I’ve purchased so had to tie the laces really tight so it was more secure around the midsection. For $50, though, I’m happy enough. I think I would size down next time by 1/2 a size since I like to wear my slip ons without socks."
Adidas,4,"Super cute shoes for style vs running. Minimal support on the sole so I can only imagine how quickly the material will deteriorate. I read the reviews and everyone said it ran one size big and then some stated it fits true so I decided to order a half size smaller (I usually can toggle between 5.5 and 6 for Women). The 5.5 was still even slightly big. I will still keep it though and just plan on wearing thicker socks. If you look at my
Photos, there’s one with my finger showing how much bigger the shoe was still. I recommend size one down."
Adidas,4,Super light and comfortable! ! I gave it a 4 star because I wished it had a little more sole padding!!
Adidas,4,Super light weight for running. But the laces are more for show I wasn’t able to make the shoe tighter on my foot. They slid on and off fairly easy so I need to wear thicker socks with them.  True to size.
Adidas,4,"Super soft! Great athleisure shoe, but I’ve also run in them while traveling and they’re fine!"
Adidas,4,"The Adidas Cloudfoam Pure Running Shoes are shoes meant for any age and any activity. They can be worn for running, weight lifting, other exercising, or just as everyday shoes; however, I purchased them for everyday wear. I am a college student who walks to class every day. These shoes have been perfect for that. My feet have not hurt one bit. I chose the black and white speckled colored ones to accommodate for comfortable, lazy-day outfits, or cute outfits with jeans! Neutrals are always a go-to in my opinion, because I am definitely one to want to get as much use out of a product as possible. This shoe wipes clean and doesn’t stain which is amazing! I was worried living in Iowa, with heavy snow and rain, that the shoe would be destroyed quite quickly. I was surprised to see how easily they wipe clean.
The Cloudfoam midsole and outsole are combined for step-in comfort and superior cushioning and the sock liner molds to hug the foot as well for extra support. I personally like the high ankle as it gives more stability. The Cloudfoam pure running shoes are super comfortable and lightweight and the fabric is a very breathable mesh. I appreciate that my feet do not sweat when I wear these shoes because of how breathable they are. I love the slick and clean look and that it feels like I am running on air, yet have plenty of support. They are super cute and come exactly as pictured.
The shoes seem to run a half-size big, so I would keep that in mind when purchasing or prepare to wear a little bit of a thicker sock and/or purchase an insole for the shoes. These shoes are more of a slip on shoe. There are laces on the shoe, but there is no tongue, so slipping the shoe on and off can be done quite easily. With that being said, you can pull the laces a little tighter if needed.
I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a good tennis shoe, hence why I rated these shoes four out of five stars! I am quite happy with my purchase and cannot wait to continue to get use out of them."
Adidas,4,"The box did not survive the shipping and came in all broken. Im a 41.5EU and got 44EU since I heard it run small. It sure is! I should’ve got 43 EU (10US) but definitely go up.
The foam isnt very thick."
Adidas,4,The color Carbon is more grey than black. Overall a stylish shoe; probably will keep anyway. Fits true to size and comfortable for casual and sportswear.
Adidas,4,"The foam in the soles ware out fast. They’re still wearable, but mostly just for style purposes. Super cute shoes, though."
Adidas,4,The shoe is good price for what you get
Adidas,4,"The shoe itself is cute. NOT true to size. I wear consistent size 8 shoes. Never had to buy an 8.5 shoe in my life until this one. I exchanged it for an 8.5 that I have not tried on, but I’m hoping it fits."
Adidas,4,"The shoes fits once I get it in, but getting them in can be difficult because there is no stretch to the opening of the shoe. They are fairly comfortable."
Adidas,4,The sneakers are very comfortable and nice looking. The only 2 things I didn't like were 1. They are a little too big for me and I ordered my size 2. I wish they had more support for when I run. Other than that I think they are a good buy.
Adidas,4,"The sole is very comfortable, but the shoe it self is a little too high on my ankles, which swells at times and that makes the shoe uncomfortable for me."
Adidas,4,There great there super comfortable great material and are great for running or working and  even great for kids!
Adidas,4,"There really isn't any practical reason for the show laces so they are a bit annoying and, when putting on the shoes, the back is often difficult to pull up over your heel. You end up missing the old shoe horns, but they do have a small tag attached that you can easily put a device into in order to help you get them on. It is just difficult to do it with only fingers if you have conditions like arthritis that affect your ability to grip. Oh, and hardly any arch support."
Adidas,4,"These are a great, lightweight, comfortable shoe for casual wear but are in no way a running or workout shoe. Love them for running errands or quick walking trips but not enough support for cross training activities and no cushion for running."
Adidas,4,"These are comfortable and simple.  Look like they can be thrown into the washer too. They are lightweight and have memory foam insoles.  I'm sure when they reach their end, I can buy new insoles."
Adidas,4,These are comfortable but I think they run just a dad bit small. I would size up 1/2 a size for comfort
Adidas,4,These are comfortable. I normally wear an 8.5 and I ordered a 9 which worked out perfectly for me.
Adidas,4,These are comfy but I would not consider them to be running or workout shoes. They are very thin. I tried to ride by stationary bike with them on and could feel the pedals digging into my feet.
Adidas,4,"These are cute & lightweight which is what I wanted, but they have an odd feel to them--almost like the heel is too high/toe area too low.  I've never noticed this with a sneaker before.  I'd already returned three other sneakers--different brands--and I kept these as best of the four."
Adidas,4,These are great quality shoes however I'll have to send them back because my feet are too wide for them
Adidas,4,"These are great. I ordered the black ones previous to these gray & they were different in some of the details. I was disappointed because I preferred the look and feel of the old ones. What I dislike is how the middle/upper/side part of the shoe goes down into a V-shape, exposing more sock. I like my foot to be covered and not have to wear those loafer  socks if I don’t want my sock out. Overall, the shoes seem pretty decent so I won’t return. The  lace area dug into my foot too much, but I will give some time to “break them in.”"
Adidas,4,"These are light weight and seems to be comfortable however size a half up.  I had to send them back then was informed they were out of the size I needed, however refunded the acct that day!"
Adidas,4,These are more fashion sneakers no the most supportive but cute.
Adidas,4,"These are more of a light lavender than light pink but still cute! I have them in black and white, too, so comfy and you can just throw them in the washing machine"
Adidas,4,"These are my second pair of ""Cloudfoam"" shoes by Adidas and they are not nearly as comfortable as the other pair I have. They also seem to run a bit more narrow in size."
Adidas,4,these are pretty nice tennis shoes! they are not super durable but they are cushy and comfortable.
Adidas,4,"These are really cute shoes! Super stylish! They are comfy but I knocked a star bc they could definitely have more cushion. Especially with a name like ""cloud foam."" I still love them but have other tennis shoes with way more support. They also run pretty big! Had to go down a 1/2 size."
Adidas,4,These are so comfortable. I love them but they are not true to size. They run a little big!
Adidas,4,"These are so cute and comfortable for light walking during errands and whatnot. I realized too late that I need the wide version of my size because I ended up with a blister. I don’t normally need wide, so now I know for next ones I buy. If your foot is even slightly wide, get them."
Adidas,4,"These are so cute!  Comfy, light and don’t make your feet sweat.
I had to return the first ones I ordered though as my normal size was too big.  I could’ve gone a full size down but went 1/2 side down and they’re fine as long as I wear socks."
Adidas,4,"These are some of the most comfortable running shoes I've ever owned.  They are so lightweight it almost feels like there is nothing on my feet.  The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is when on slightly rocky surfaces, I can feel every single pebble it seems like.  These are probably better for in door exercise or super smooth surfaces.  Otherwise, I really enjoy them.  I ended up buying the same pair in gray as well.  I typically wear a 9 or 9.5 and ended up getting the 9.5 in these.  If you like wearing thick socks, maybe order up a half size."
Adidas,4,These are super comfortable but have a good bit of room in the toe of the shoe! I love these because it is tight enough to keep the shoe on but loose enough that I can easily slip them on and go.
Adidas,4,These are super comfy BUT I will say the stationary tongue is a little bit too hard and does stick into the top of my ankle.
Adidas,4,"These are super comfy for short time spans on hard surfaces (tile/concrete) and very light weight! The soles aren’t real thick, but are soft. They are just a tad bigger than i would usually pick out. I wear and ordered a 7.5 and I’d say they are in between that and an 8. But I laced them a little tighter and to work I went! So cute!"
Adidas,4,These are super light weight. I don’t think they would hold up very long if you’re using them for running or heavy workouts.
Adidas,4,"These are very comfy shoes, and I get compliments on them all the time. Although I wear them to work out when I'm not doing the treadmill or step, as they are not a true runnning shoe. But they're very comfortable, and a good choice when you're wearing yoga pants and don't want to wear your (clunky) running shoes.
  My only issue with them is tying them. There is no tongue, so you slip them on and tie them using the loop at the top. This takes practice if you like them tight on your foot. Not a huge deal, but know they're not like regular ""tie"" shoes."
Adidas,4,"These are very cute and very comfortable. I am normally a women's US 9 or 9.5. I ordered the 9 in this shoe and it is a little bigger than I was expected. I will still keep them and wear often, they are definitely not too big, but for my next pair I might try an 8.5."
Adidas,4,"These are very light weight and comfy shoes.  However, not sure how people work out in them.  Structure is lacking.  I use for my normal daily walks around 2 miles.  They’re good for that and wearing as a normal shoe to run to store, etc.  they are pull on with laces to tighten them up.  They fit good and they are a little long at the toe area."
Adidas,4,These are very nice & comfy. I will be adding an insert inside for more support. I wear 6 in adidas my usual size. I didn’t  need to size up in these. I wear a 6.5 in Nike for comparison . Very cute & stylish!
Adidas,4,These felt a little tight in my feet because I have wide feet but once I broke them in I enjoyed them. I like how easy it is to slip on the shoes and how light weight they are but I wish there was a little more support from them.
Adidas,4,These legit feel like clouds. I was concerned about the slip-on nature of them especially when I put them on and they appeared to gap a bit but took them on their first run and they were amazing.
Adidas,4,These run about a half size big in my opinion. There is no arch support at all. They do look the same in person as in picture.
Adidas,4,These run large. Size down by 1/2 size.
Adidas,4,These Shoes are both beautiful and comfortable. I love them. The only thing to consider is that they get dirty very fast. I’ve worn them twice and cleaned them twice. If it weren’t for that I’d have given it 5 stars.
Adidas,4,These shoes are comfortable.  They feel light as air when you wear them.  There isn’t much support to be running shoes but they are good walking shoes.  One of my favorite shoes to wear because of how comfortable they are.  I like them so much that I just bought a second pair in a different color.
Adidas,4,These shoes are good but a bit narrow. They are light weight but the bottoms are a bit clunky. Would not work out in them but they are good for wveryday use.  Also they color seemed different in person than on the picture...
Adidas,4,These shoes are good for my plantar fasciitis.  I like the way they fit.  The only thing I don't like is that they are a bit difficult to get into because they don't open wide.
Adidas,4,"These shoes are great because it comes with space to put in any kind of supportive insole that you may need. Luckily, I had some insoles. I suggest buying insoles or be prepared to put them in the shoes when you get them. Without insoles my anterior tibialis muscle was killing me on a walk. I put in my insoles and they’re fine and my shoes still fit."
Adidas,4,These shoes are great for running errands but that’s about it. Easy on but have no support for walking let alone running.
Adidas,4,"These shoes are great! I love the look of them and I bought them for a trip with a lot of walking involved. They were comfy to walk all day in over multiple days. The only thing I dislike is the little tag (that always sticks out on the top of the tongue on tennis shoes) kept rubbing on my skin and irritated it. I have had a red mark for several days now where it rubbed. The tongue is different than what I’m used to because it is attached to the shoe in one piece, not tucked in under the laces, so I couldn’t adjust it at all to stop it from rubbing on my ankle area. I would suggest buying these if you aren’t planning to wear them on a daily basis all day long or if you can wear them with longer socks to prevent irritation."
Adidas,4,"These shoes are just darling. Unfortunately, they run a size too big. I was tempted to keep them anyways but there was a large gab in back so they slipped and looked a little silly. I would repurchase in a size smaller but that size is almost $13 more which just takes a all the fun out of shopping. I found them on the adidas site for the same price I paid ($35) in my size so will prob order there but do prefer amazon. As a general note, I love amazon but the price difference between various sizes is pretty off putting. Just a thought for the powers that be-at the very least it would be nice to be able to just exchange if necessary. I am size 6 95% of the time-these just ran very big but I ordered them in good faith so a bit disappointing.
P.S. The only reason these are not 5 star plus is the sizing since it was not even close, at least for me"
Adidas,4,These shoes are light and comfortable however the sole is so thin you can feel gravel through them.
Adidas,4,"These shoes are NOT for running any type of serious distance or with consistency— there isn’t the appropriate support in the sole or upper shoe area. You’ll be in for a world of hurt in your knees and tendons if you use these for running. Biking, maybe. You’d be wise to go with a pair of Brooks for running. BUT— my 4 star review comes because these shoes are what I expected for just going around town— the park with kids, the store, yard work, etc. They’re cute and comfortable for that purpose."
Adidas,4,These shoes are OK. Would not buy them again. They are not the most comfy shoes.
Adidas,4,These shoes are really cool that they have no tongue. The laces are very long. The color and feel are very nice with the cloudfoam. The shoes itself is very thin and it doesn't feel as expensive as it is. Should cost less for what you get.
Adidas,4,"These shoes are really cute and stylish.  They are relatively comfortable, but I wouldn't wear them for working out/running.  They don't have enough support for that.  For the price, they have been good casual shoes.  I read a lot of reviews that said these run big, so I ordered down half a size.  I had to send the first pair back and reorder them in my usual size for a good fit."
Adidas,4,"these shoes are so comfortable and I really enjoy wearing them, the only critique I have is that they form a little crease as you walk across the area where the toes meets the foot. Not a big deal, and they are really comfortable and look good."
Adidas,4,"These shoes are so comfy, but way way too big. I tried three different pairs from Amazon, and all too big. Finally had to buy in a local store at 2 sizes smaller than my normal shoe size so I could get them in time. I recommend using Amazon wardrobe to try on multiple sizes if you have time to wait. I have a wide foot, and these shoes fully accomodate my feet with no rub or tension. The sole is cushioned, but not too squishy. The fabric is breathable mesh, and ideal for barefeet."

Adidas,4,"These shoes are so cute! I just got them today, I am usually an 8.5 in nikes but after reading the comments I went with 8 and they fit perfectly! Still need to wear them to work and what not (hence why it doesn’t have 5 stars) , will be updating once I get a really good feel for them:)"
Adidas,4,"These shoes are so cute!
They are amazingly lightweight, very cool and comfortable.
I plan to use them for walking/hiking and for work shoes!"
Adidas,4,"These shoes are so snugI need a shoe horn to put them on - otherwise, without one it takes me ages.  I almost returned them for that reason, but actually once on they feel soooo comfortable.  I kept them & love how they feel & look."
Adidas,4,"These shoes are stylish, but besides short distance walks they do not have support for anything too strenuous. These are great for a casual stroll, not the gym"
Adidas,4,"These shoes are super comfortable! The only drawback is for a mesh shoe they don't have any give. My feet swell occasionally from back problems & I bought these hoping they would have some give like my air max that were mesh also. I bought these for a day trip with a lot of walking & they were extremely comfortable without a break in period! I literally received them the night before my early morning start day trip. The cloud foam does feel like walking on clouds. Would definitely recommend for an affordable, comfy sneaker!"
Adidas,4,"These shoes are super comfortable, but do not last if being used for walking on sidewalks/pavement. I really like the shoes. They are cute and very comfortable, but only lasted 2 months before I wore a hole right through the sole. I would think these shoes would be good for a casual sneaker to wear around, but not for exercising."
Adidas,4,"These shoes are super cute & comfy. I wouldn’t wear them for running as they don’t feel as if they have enough support, but they are great for leisure. The only complaint I have is they are slightly tight across the top of my foot and this can’t be adjusted. The laces are simply for looks."
Adidas,4,These shoes are super cute and comfy. However I recommend sizing down 1/2 a size at least.
Adidas,4,"These shoes are very comfortable. I always wear a 7 1/2, but these are to big. I should have sized down at least a half of a size."
Adidas,4,These shoes are very comfortable. Love to look.  Seem to made very good. I wish I would have order a half size smaller because they run a little big.
Adidas,4,"These shoes are very cute and comfortable. The only issue is the sizing is completely off. I am normally a 7.5 in women’s shoes. I had to order this item 3 different times: 1st I got a 7.5 which was humongous, 2nd ordered a 7 and still too way big, and then finally 3rd time’s a charm - the 6.5 fit me comfortably. I have never been a 6.5 in shoes so this came as a surprise. I’m not sure if the sizing is weird for adidas in general or this particular shoe, but I would recommend sizing a whole number down unless you like a ton of room."
Adidas,4,These shoes DO feel like a cloud. They are so comfortable. I've never owned any adidas but I'm so glad my friends told me to buy these. They feel like sneaker slippers due to not having a shoe tongue...they feel great to run in. I would only suggest to size down though! Got a 9.5 and could have easily done a 9.
Adidas,4,"These shoes look and feel great on the foot. They do provide a little support- but I wouldn't recommend these for long distance running or heavy workouts as they don't provide THAT much support. Great for an everyday tennis shoe. The only complaint I have is the sizing: I have been wearing a 7.5 in tennis shoes for a long time, these shoes are just a little too big on my feet. I would size down if you normally wear a half size like me."
Adidas,4,"These shoes look really cute and fit well, but sadly, they're fake. I checked on Adidas website just to make sure. On the inside, the original has ""Memory foam footbed"" print but this one has ""Cloud foam super"
Adidas,4,"These shoes were comfortable, but I had to return them. I ""orange"" shoes I ordered actually looked more pink than orange. I'm a basketball coach at a school whose colors are black and orange, so pink wouldn't work!"
Adidas,4,These slip on shoes are very comfortable. You need to size down a size as they stretch over time.
Adidas,4,"These Sneakers are comfortable. The neck is a bit tight, so when you're slipping your foot in, you need to maneuver it quite a but to get it in. My friend wears 8.5 shoe size. I Should have bought her a 9, however it was not available on Amazon in the color combination she wanted"
Adidas,4,"These sneakers are one of my favs (I have them in a few colors). They feel like walking on a cloud (literally). However, when I buy these in store in my normal size 8 women, they fit perfect - but this pair I received through Amazon, were actually about a 1/2 size too big! Otherwise, I have no complaints!"
Adidas,4,"These sneakers are super comfy and look great, BUT, the shoelaces are a weird material and they come undone too often even with a double knot. That’s my only complaint."
Adidas,4,"These sneakers are very cute and extremely lightweight, beware if you have a very narrow and thin foot like myself, they look a little strange when you try to tighten the laces since the shoe has no tongue."
Adidas,4,"These sneakers seem cheap, logo was a little warn off and they fit me tight. I'm a size 8 and I have flat feet so I'm always look for sneakers with high comfort and great arch support but these fit me tight not as comfortable as I expected. I always buy adidas sneakers and never have complaints but these are definitely my least favorite. Wouldn't buy again I can't even fit my shoe inserts. Go a size up."
Adidas,4,"These were gorgeous and a good price, but they were a little too loose at top for me, which caused them to pucker upon tying. Super sad!"
Adidas,4,"These were recommended to me after I started having crippling arch pain after years of wearing a zero drop shoe. 1 month of wear for workouts and walking the dog, the pain is minimized and manageable.

Pros: sooooo light, it feels like you’re wearing nothing. My preferred footwear would be barefoot, so this light shoe is a blessing. I love how easy they are to get on and off, and have super long laces.

Cons: I’m not huge on the looks. This is not specific to this shoe - it’s just what an Addidas sneaker looks like in 2020, and it’s not an aesthetic I enjoy. They look like orthopedic shoes to me. Also, they won’t last. The amount of wear on my heels after 1 month is significant. I only wear them for 30-45 minutes of resistance training and for a couple of miles of walking my dog on a sidewalk, but they look worse than shoes I’ve run hundreds of miles in. I doubt these survive 3 months.

Not a pro or con, but just a note: They also run large. I wear a 7.5 in almost every brand, but I think I could have sized down to a 7 in these."
Adidas,4,"These were recommended to me as a shoe that would work for training as well (Beach Body). After wearing them a few times they caused pain in my arches. They are comfy shoes that are lighter than air however more support may be necessary for working out, even running/walking would be uncomfortable on some surfaces for some."
Adidas,4,These were very comfortable and super cute but way too big and I ordered my normal size. I’d size a full-size.
Adidas,4,They are comfortable & look great.  Not what you would want for running.  But more for walking & fashion
Adidas,4,"They are good shoes, good for walking around in a theme park all day. They’re light and bouncy and very comfortable.The only downside I have with them is that they’re not water resistance/waterproof. Like these things suck up water, like way more than normal sneakers (i assume because of the memory cloud foam). Still they were comfortable and cute as can be."
Adidas,4,"They are super comfortable, although it’s weird not having a tongue on them, they’re great!"
Adidas,4,"They are very comfortable. Fit is too big. I usually wear a size 8. I should have ordered a half size smaller, 7 1/2 would have been perfect."
Adidas,4,"They are very nice, comfortable, true to size."
Adidas,4,"They are very soft and comfortable.  I usually suffer from metatarsal pain thru half of my walk and these shoes definitely helped a lot.  The arch support is not great but not bad for me.
I think I  could have easily sized down to 7.5 as my foot slips a bit to the front and it feels a little loose in the heel (I usually wear size 8 on most shoes so ordered regular size).  But overall, since I am not running, I think these will work out very well. Recommend."
Adidas,4,They fit a little snug. But are great for walking all day. Love the color and the cloud foam soles.
Adidas,4,"They fit but are a little tight around the arch. Without the traditional ""tongue"" the tightness of the shoe isn't adjustable."
Adidas,4,"They fit very well and I love the look! However, not much support. My legs aches after wearing them."
Adidas,4,They for a lil snug around the top but my ankles swell by end of day.  A wide width would be great.
Adidas,4,They look amazing! However 1/2 size larger than your size. I’m a spot on 8.5 and it fit like a 9.  My sister ordered 9.5 fit like a 10. Comfortable & look exactly like picture. I recommend ordering 1/2 smaller.
Adidas,4,"They look more white online, even though I know they say blue in the description. Was disappointed they were more blue then white."
Adidas,4,"They look really cute on, but the cloud form sole of this shoe doesn't seem to fit like other cloud form shoes I've purchased from Adidas before.  It's just not as comfortable as I had hoped."
Adidas,4,"They run a little big, but I like them.  Very comfy."
Adidas,4,They run a little large I would other half a size down.
Adidas,4,"They run at least a size large, but they are comfortable. Good for working out!"
Adidas,4,They run small. Attractive and light weight.
Adidas,4,"This is a really stylish shoe at a great price for it being Adidas brand, but I would NOT recommend these for running. They provide very little support & it is not long before your feet/ankles start to feel sore after going longer distances. That being said, these are good walking shoes for everyday outings, comfortable to wear on a plane & fit as expected."
Adidas,4,"This is my second pair of Cloudfoam and I am pleased with my purchase.  This is a very stylish shoe and it is lightweight as well.  It does not have a lot of support in the sole and sometimes you can feel uneven surfaces such as rocks through the sole of the shoe, but it is perfect for walking through the city and strolling through town.  My foot is narrow, and this shoe fits nice and snug."
Adidas,4,"This is not a shoe for running or working out—-very little support but is very cushy. I bought them for grocery shopping, errands, and for style and I love them. I wear them frequently and they haven’t stained or gotten very worn.

I tested them out at work (12hr nursing shift) and my legs hurt so they are basically just cute. :)"
Adidas,4,"This is the second pair I have purchased over the years. They are very cute and comfortable shoes! Great for everyday wear. I wouldn’t recommend them for working out. It may just be me, but when walking long distances or running they made my feet sore."
Adidas,4,"This product, given the reviews, is as expected. Great product for the price. After reading reviews I decided to order a size bigger (which never works out for me). It fits perfectly. I can tell that this shoe will not last as long as my last $$$ pair but I would buy this again."
Adidas,4,"This shoe has very little rigidity to its structure and therefore not a lot of support.  The only way I can describe the experience of wearing these is... very ""slipper-like"".  There is no tongue to get twisted around and the laces seem like an accessory; you can just pull these on and go.  They are very comfortable, which is what I needed because of various foot problems I currently have.  The sole is cushiony but not thick at all.  If you stepped on a pebble while walking on pavement you would definitely feel it transfer through the sole... think of the tale about ""The Princess and the Pea"".  But these are great shoes if your expectations are aligned with casual use."
Adidas,4,"This shoe is aptly named ""Cloudfoam"" since it is very light, comfortable with a nice foam insole.  I wouldn't recommend it for exercise or long walks since it lacks structure."
Adidas,4,This shoe is comfortable but it wouldn't be ideal for me with running because of the knit exterior. I used them at the gym and they were adequate but running would not be good. The knit exterior is too expandable(?) when your feet hit the material it moves too much. Weird explanation i know.
Adidas,4,"This shoe is more of a ‘running around’ shoe to me than an actual running shoe. Very, very comfortable, but not sure it has the support needed for a running shoe. Very lightweight  and has some support. It does not have an actual separate tongue so it does take a bit of effort to get the shoe on (without snapping off a nail, ouch)."
Adidas,4,"This shoe is so comfy and I love how it can easily slip on. It’s my go to shoe on the daily. It’s been comfortable for running so far, but I’m not sure how they will hold up long term. They do get dirty easily, but they are white so that is to be expected."
Adidas,4,"This shoe is very comfortable and pairs well with many outfits. However, it definitely is not supportive enough to use for running.  It's for walking and gym workouts.  Another issue I had was that it is a half size too large. So buy smaller."
Adidas,4,This shoe ran 1/2 size too big. Comfortable if correct size.
Adidas,4,This shoe runs true to size lengthwise but is narrow compared to my other adidas. I would not recommend for someone with a wide foot. It’s a super light shoe and very comfortable
Adidas,4,"This shoes are smaller than usual size.
I have size 5, but they are too tight for me.
Made in Indonezia.
Shoes are very light, nice material, but not much support if you are standing or walking for 8 hours."
Adidas,4,This was a gift for my daughter. She uses this pair of running shoes at the treadmill . The shoes are comfortable and she really likes them.
Adidas,4,"Thsee are nice, slip on sneakers but runs size to large. I normally wear 8 but had to return and order 7. But are very comfortable and easy to put on"
Adidas,4,"Tight fit but fits. I like hiking, definitely can’t wear these shoes for running on rocks."
Adidas,4,To work out
Adidas,4,Tongue is a little high but I got used to it. Very comfortable
Adidas,4,Too large and left a gap around my ankle. I order a size down. We'll see if it's any better.
Adidas,4,"True to size and good fit, just not much arch support."
Adidas,4,"True to size, easy to wipe off BUT the pink color isn’t really pink it’s more of a light purple in my opinion. Still cute though."
Adidas,4,Usually wear an 8.5 had to return for a 9. Great for narrow feet! Very comfortable and I like the look.
Adidas,4,Very comfortable
Adidas,4,Very comfortable
Adidas,4,Very comfortable
Adidas,4,Very comfortable and a good fit.
Adidas,4,Very comfortable and light. I advise a full size smaller. I usually wear a 6.5 but ordered a 6 due to reviews. Still too big. Next time I will order a 5.5
Adidas,4,Very comfortable but a little big.
Adidas,4,Very comfortable shoe for daily casual wear! I don't think they're the ideal running shoe as they might be too soft.
Adidas,4,"Very comfortable shoe, just what I was looking for"
Adidas,4,Very comfortable!  Just needed a smaller size.
Adidas,4,"Very comfortable, but not for being on your feet for long periods or exercise.  I am used to the Cloudfoam soles, but these are thinner than the other I have tried.  I will use them for casual wear because they are very cute.  Would have given five stars if soles were like the traditional Cloudfoam soles."
Adidas,4,"Very comfortable, easy on and off.  Laces a little long but overall great quality and comfortable."
Adidas,4,"Very comfortable, runs small order a half size up"
Adidas,4,"Very comfortable, the bottom just doesn’t have very much grip or traction on it. Great for walking around the town!"
Adidas,4,Very comfortable. I have a narrow foot and have a hard time finding running shoes that fit and are stylish.
Adidas,4,Very comfortable. I like that I can just slide them on. I personally do not think they have enough support to run in.
Adidas,4,"Very comfortable. I’m normally an 8.5, I saw these are true to size however they were too big for me and my foot was slipping out. Will exchange for a size 8"
Adidas,4,Very comfortable. Not a lot of arch support. She was also a little wide but overall they go to pair for a day out shopping or walking the dog. Super cute on.
Adidas,4,Very comfy and love the color!
Adidas,4,Very comfy great for running feels like slippers not sneakers love them
Adidas,4,"Very comfy, but they don’t breath that well so I find my feet get sweaty if I wear them on a warm day.  Definatly worth getting for winter though."
Adidas,4,Very comfy. Slightly bigger than my normal fit though.
Adidas,4,Very cute
Adidas,4,"Very cute and comfy! Not a lot of support so I would not recommend for a runner or for working out in. These are more like just running errands shoes. I ordered a 7, and in my opinion fit more like 7.5. Still worth the money I paid though."
Adidas,4,"Very cute and comfy, but not much padding for the ball of foot which caused me pain after extended walking.  Was ok for short term walking. Runs slightly large, but not enough for me to go down a size.  Liked enough to buy a 2nd pair in another color."
Adidas,4,"Very flexible and comfortable. Not built for heavier people though, which I am, so standing for long periods of time get uncomfortable. Overall still love them!"
Adidas,4,Very light weigh and comfy.
Adidas,4,"Very light weight and comfy, good for walking. Never tried much heavier because the construction just seems a little too lightweight for heavy lifting or running. And they were slightly larger than I expected."
Adidas,4,Very light.  Had to go up from a usual size 9 in Adidas to 9 1/2.  A bit narrow.
Adidas,4,Very lightweight and comfy!
Adidas,4,Very nice but feels like it might slide off easily. But it hasn't so...still wearing them to the gym :)
Adidas,4,Very nice quality shoe and super comfy.
Adidas,4,Very soft and light shoe. Good for walking around comfortably. I haven’t tried running in them yet but seems like it may not be as sturdy. I followed what others said about the sizing and went up a half size and fits perfectly.
Adidas,4,Walking shoes
Adidas,4,"Was looking for a shoe I could wear on some upcoming trips where I know I will be walking a lot. Wanted it to be cute, not too bulky, easy to take on/off at airport, and comfortable enough to wear all day / 5-8 miles a day. I think these should work great - they are really comfortable, fit as expected and are cute sneakers.

That being said, if you are looking at these as potential running shoes I would not recommend. They are really lightweight and don't have anything that would lessen impact (the memory foam is very thin). You will definitely feel the ground with every step. As a runner, I just can't imagine wearing them for more than 2-3 miles without regretting it."
Adidas,4,"What a bargain these shoes are! I would mostly wear these for quick grab-and-go tennis shoe situations, have yet to try a workout with them. Not highly supportive, fine without socks. No blisters!"
Adidas,4,"While the shoes were fine, the shoe box was all banged up and held together by a rubber band.  I returned the product because I ordered the wrong size."
Adidas,4,Working out. Not quite as cushion as you would think. runs a little smaller than I expected it to but not bad.
Adidas,4,"Would be 5 stars, all the way, except my right shoe has something pokey in the toe area. It stabs me sometimes during workouts. I have tried feeling around inside, and I can locate the issue with my finger sometimes, but can't get it out. Maybe it's in the stitching? Not sure if others have had this issue, but I would guess this is an isolated incident with just my pair of shoes?

Anything I can do, Adidas?"
Asics,4,A little big in heel... but glad that ordered wide cause the regular might have been too tight...never had ASICs before but tried on in store from clearance venture6 8.5 wide and was just right. ..in this shoe though it might have run shorter so glad ordered up a size 9
Asics,4,A little bit on the hard side. Wish it was lighter.
Asics,4,A little tighter than expected but very comfortable.
Asics,4,A solid comfortable fit.
Asics,4,A very comfortable jogging and walking shoe. Good arch support and side stiffness for jogging on trails. Sadly if you live in a wet area or have wet roads they are very slippery. Dangerous to wear when the conditions are wet. They have so little tred that they are best as a trail shoe not on pavement that could get wet.
Asics,4,After they get broke in they are wonderful and very comfortable.
Asics,4,"After trying several different shoes, these fit the best. Exactly what I needed."
Asics,4,Agrado
Asics,4,"As a size 12, I find the consistency in shoe sizing to be lacking. These are a bit tight in the toes but I’ve decided to keep them anyway. At first it was annoying but after a week they stretched out a bit. I use them from hiking and running and I have no complaints on their cushioning or spring."
Asics,4,As always; they do not disappoint! I know that I can order my usual size and they will be good to go.
Asics,4,"As I saw some of the reviews saying the color was wrong. Mine came as expected and I was so glad. The color is super cute!
They are very supportive and they fit really good. The only down side is that they are very warm."
Asics,4,"Asics are ""my"" brand of running shoes.

However, I was surprised that the actual colors of this shoe is not accurate. They are actually navy, lavender, and teal.  They are not black/silver as advertised when I purchased these and when I  received these on July 13, 2020.

If the color description was accurate, I would rate them 5 stars as great running shoes for the money."
Asics,4,"ASICS are always my go to for walking/running shoes.  For me this version runs a tad shorter and a tad wider than other versions I've worn, but they are still great for walking.  They are also lightweight, keep my feet fairly dry on wet grass and comfortable.  I actually brought them in 3 different colors."
Asics,4,Asics are my first choice always....sizing is perfect.
Asics,4,Asics are pretty much the only athletic type shoe that fit my wide feet nicely. These fit as expected but ultimately I decided to go with another style/color
Asics,4,Asics are the best!
Asics,4,"ASICS run small, so I always order a 10, even though I normally wear a 9.  These are no different. It is a good looking shoe!  Nice and stable.  Very light.  Good tread surface.  It is a little stiff and less cushy than the more expensive shoes, but a nice shoe to wear to general athletic stuff or walking.  I would not run long distances on hard surfaces with them, but I like them a lot."
Asics,4,ASICS Women's Gel-Venture 7 Running Shoes are nice style for trail running they are a bit stiff though I think when walking around they seem to have a tendency of the laces opening up or loosing other than that they  are good
Asics,4,"Beautiful color and finishing, comfortable!!"
Asics,4,Been wearing the shoes for about a week.  Like them very much.  Nice color for winter.
Asics,4,Bought for daughter for work. She lives the fit and feel.
Asics,4,Bought them for a Disney World trip and they held up quite well
Asics,4,Bought them for my sister. And she lives them
Asics,4,"Bought these because I've been told Asics runs more on the narrow side which I need.  Wanted to replace my worn New Balance 990 which have been absolutely perfect in fit and comfort.  But at $150+ my senior citizen budget wouldn't allow purchase of the New Balance.  I walk several miles most days, and go camping/hiking so need a decent pair of shoes ... I've searched many, many styles always looking for narrow in half-size and not many manufacturers offer narrows or if they do, they're beyond my budget.  Was able to buy these Asics for very reasonable price and they're pretty nice, although they're a 7.5 medium.  They're lightweight, have attractive design in nice subtle coloring.  As others have mentioned, they shoe laces work but are too thin ... a minor gripe.  They are still too wide for my foot (which was expected) but not as wide as other shoes that I've tried.  I compensated for that by using foam full inserts.  Full sole inserts are needed not only to help fit my narrow foot better but the extra foam is absolutely needed because IMHO these Asics as purchased don't have enough sole padding.,,sole felt a bit thin without full inserts.  I also use plantar fasciitis inserts which fit fine in these shoes.  Have been walking in them for over a month and they're quite comfortable.  Not as good as the NB 990 but nowhere near that price either."
Asics,4,Bought these due to plantar fasciitis this shoe was recommended for support. Seems to be helping a bit and they are comfortable. Runs a bit large/wide.
Asics,4,"Bought these in wide. The heel is very stable, my feet feel supported. These Asics can handle a variety of terrain as well.  Comfortable, stable, supportive. One star off only because of lack of style - mostly utilitarian. Very pleased.
Recommend if comfort is more important than style to you."
Asics,4,Color as expected.
Asics,4,"Color is a little darker on the photo.
Slightly rigid, in comfort"
Asics,4,Colour is not so attractive
Asics,4,Comfortable
Asics,4,"Comfortable all day work shoe.I work retail do it's a concrete floor.
Shoe was recommended by by foot therepy Dr."
Asics,4,"Comfortable and affordable. Unfortunately they created a bad odor on day one of wearing. Other than that, no complaints!"
Asics,4,Comfortable and feels supportive.
Asics,4,Comfortable and good for wider feet
Asics,4,Comfortable and inexpensive. They look great with my uniform.
Asics,4,Comfortable well made shoe but traction is a bit too grabby on certain surfaces.
Asics,4,"Comfortable with a removable insole  to accomodate orthotics.  Slightly too wide for me, but will do."
Asics,4,Comfortable! Good tread. Would recommend.
Asics,4,"Comfortable, great price!"
Asics,4,Comfortable. Good shoe for the price.
Asics,4,Comfortable. Nice color.
Asics,4,Comfy and very nice tread. I still feel for a wide width they fit tight. The one thing I'm changing is the laces - I have big feet and wear ankle foot orthodics which mean my foot is raised a bit in the shoe so I need longer laces.
Asics,4,Comfy and worked great for what I needed them for.
Asics,4,Conformable except in the toe area. May just need broken in more.
Asics,4,Cute style and comfortable
Asics,4,"Daily use. Wouldn't use it for running, though..."
Asics,4,Decent shoes for the money.  I have somewhat a tough time finding shoes that will not rub a blister on the bottom of my foot.  I have narrow flat feet - no arch at all.  These shoes are perfect for my 2 by 4s.
Asics,4,Dependable and great shoe.
Asics,4,"Disappointed with fit. I’m a typical size 9, but my toes came to end of shoe. Nice shoes. Didn’t take them out as too small"
Asics,4,El dedo pequeño me roza bastante y me incomóda🥺
Asics,4,Every day working
Asics,4,"Everything fit perfect except, across the top of my foot was really tight. But they did break in after the first time or two wearing them. They are great now"
Asics,4,Exactly what was pictured. Perfect fit.
Asics,4,Fantastic! Im an asics fan... this didn't disappoint.  Light and plenty of room in the width as im a flatten as i walk kinda girl! Love!
Asics,4,"Fast delivery, shoe fits but old shoes are more comfortable. The strings are a joke! The worst I have ever seen, very thin, short and cheap material. Thinking about switching them out. My old ones were great."
Asics,4,"First off ASICS wrongly named this shoe black/silver, it’s a definite mistake as it is clearly navy and teal. This shoe runs short in length so 1/2 it up a size.  It has no removable inner sock. Not a lot of cushion and feels more stiff than most running shoes but is not a high end shoe to begin with. I got it for walking in the road and grass, hoped it was water resistant but it isn’t. Tried many trail Gortex shoes and returned them all. Much too stiff, like wearing a block on your foot and hard to tie. I will keep these. They are nice looking with the navy and inner lavender with a bit of teal markings. Laces are unusually thin, but they do stay tied.  Tried putting several orthotics in but because the sock liner doesn’t come out, it raised foot up too high and my heel slipped. I found a flatter orthotic and that worked. This is just an ordinary shoe.
Paid $54."
Asics,4,"First off I love this brand, ever since my sister introduced me to them they have been great. They last 3-5 years and comfort is key. Only 2 days in but I am a concrete jogger so the gel insoles help a lot compared to Champions."
Asics,4,Fit as expected
Asics,4,"fit good,"
Asics,4,Fit great
Asics,4,"Fit is as expected and true to size.  Need a wider toe box and these are great. The insoles and laces are thin and cheap but, that is usual with all athletic shoes now."
Asics,4,Fit perfect to size
Asics,4,Fits comfortably
Asics,4,Fits good
Asics,4,"Fits great. Wear them standing for very long periods of time, and no foot pain."
Asics,4,Fits well. Good  shoe. would  recommend.
Asics,4,Fits well. Good arch support. The shoe has a more stiff exterior than I'd like but arch support is good and I rarely have to retie or mess w the shoe once it's on
Asics,4,For the money this shoe was good.  I have a growth on my foot that it rubbed si had to give away but my friend loves them.
Asics,4,Fots perfectly; is a very neutral shoe and lovely for my needs.
Asics,4,"Good buy and fit, not as padded as Adidas ultraboost but still a very good work out shoe. I usually do high impact workouts and running and so far it's comfortable"
Asics,4,Good fit
Asics,4,Good fit for walking for exercise.
Asics,4,Good for an average workout. Provides adequate support.
Asics,4,Good looking shoe and they fit as expected. I would actually give it 3.5 stars if I could because I think they could use a little more cushion.
Asics,4,good price shoe is as advertised
Asics,4,Good Shoe
Asics,4,Good shoe for the price. Usually Aasics are fairly comfortable but these aren't as comfortable as I'm used to from this brand.
Asics,4,Good shoe! Not as cute as I wanted so 4/5 not 5/5
Asics,4,"Good shoe.  The better half was happy.

Thought the price for this color was high, higher than others."
Asics,4,Good toe space and nice snug heel. Over all support and comfort is less than expected.  Nice looking shoe.
Asics,4,Great color...fits well. I wish it had a bit more padding at the heel.
Asics,4,"Great fit and comfort, plus beautiful pattern and colors. The ties are a little thin but I am happy to wear these regularly now."
Asics,4,"Great fit, very comfortable"
Asics,4,"Great looking but feel stiff on bottom.
I'm sure they would be much more comfy w gel inserts"
Asics,4,Great product
Asics,4,Great product
Asics,4,Great shoe fits as expected
Asics,4,Great shoe fits perfectly comfortable good buy.
Asics,4,Great shoe for the money - very comfortable.
Asics,4,"Great shoe. Ordered black, box said black, but shoes are navy."
Asics,4,Great shoes
Asics,4,Great shoes and perfect fit. I really like the traction the sole provides as well as overall stability. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the shoelaces are horrible! I had read another review that said this prior to purchasing so I included a pair of my favorite no-tie shoelaces in my order which I can't recommend enough.
Asics,4,Great shoes but I feel like I am constantly having to tie them. But they have held up and super comfortable.
Asics,4,"Great shoes for outdoor running, works great in the snow too!"
Asics,4,Great shoes just a little smaller that planned
Asics,4,"Great shoes! Good fit, very durable and good arch support."
Asics,4,"Great shoes, however color is mislabeled. The one that says black and silver is actually navy blue and teal and purple."
Asics,4,"Great shoes, love ASICS."
Asics,4,"Great support and good fit for me. I have a narrow foot and it’s hard to find an athletic shoe that doesn’t let my foot slide around. I didn’t do 5 stars because they are a bit stiffer than most athletic shoes, but that may be the key to the support. I’m on my feet all day and these shoes don’t disappoint.  I really like the color, especially the light gray bottoms. I have a fettish about white soles that get dirty so easily."
Asics,4,Great support and true fit.
Asics,4,Great support!
Asics,4,Had to return first pair and order a half size larger than normal size. Now they are great!
Asics,4,have worn asic for years
Asics,4,I absolutely love these! They feel so good on my feet. I use them for walking with my family. I also feel like I look really cute in these colors! Exactly what I wanted!
Asics,4,"I always wore Adidas running shoes so I am comparing these ASICS to Adidas.  These running shoes are much stiffer and less cushiony than Adidas. They also rub a little around my ankles. I couldn't find the classic 1990s style Adidas running shoes anywhere without paying >$100.  I give these ASICS 5 stars for affordability and style, and 4 stars for comfort."
Asics,4,"I am a size 9 and I bought a size 9. I like that it gives my foot strong support and even a bit of lift. I think it could be a great hiking shoe if you live in the western area of the US.  If you don't necessary need hiking boots to tuck pants or leggings into these have enough grip on the bottoms. These would work well on a hike. I use them for walks, I walk 6 miles a day everyday. If you are a runner just FYI they run hot. They look the same in person as they did online for the Chili Flake color."
Asics,4,"I am pleased to find them. They are really supportive, my feet are wide and yet are really comfortable. I love the design as well. They are lightweight, too much for my personal preference. Also, they are not completely black but, very deep grey which makes them kind of elegant. Shock absorbing is good and I cleaned them easily. So, I happy."
Asics,4,I bought a 7.5W and they still seemed to run a bit small. Even with the wide width the toe box is rather narrow and pointed. The cushioning is great though and they are otherwise very comfortable.
Asics,4,I bought these a little over 2 months ago for me to wear to work. I love how these shoes fit and the comfort wearing them for 8 to 9 hours a day. My only issue is the threading at the toe is already coming apart.
Asics,4,"I bought these after fracturing my foot. I was able to start to walk without a boot but needed something that would be comfortable yet supportive. They fit great and were the color I was looking for as well. I have the Ventura gel 6 and like these just as much. I can wear them all day and not have tons of pain.

The only reason they are not getting 5 stars is due to the tongue of the sneaker. It seems extra padded and makes the sneaker look puffy."
Asics,4,"I bought these for step aerobics and walking and so far all is good. I felt they ran a little bit big, so that's why 4 stars. I'll update my post when the shoes are reasonably broken in, especially waiting to see if the cushioning holds up."
Asics,4,"I bought these for work after reading some reviews.  I’m on my feet 10-11 hours a day and I also have planter fasciitis in my right foot and there work better than my Air Nikes, my feet only felt a little tired by the end of the day as expected. Definitely buying another pair."
Asics,4,"I bought these in wide and I actually had to check the box because I thought I got the wrong order. So definitely look into going a half size or whole size up.

The comfort is amazing. I love the cushion inside which makes walking very comfortable. I've only had them for a little while so I'll update after a couple months of heavy gym use."
Asics,4,"I bought these shoes during the Covid-19 pandemic to be able to get out and do some walking. Several years ago I had my tender feet professionally measured (Read: by someone at a specialty shoe store, not at a cheap chain store), and I was shocked to learn that I have size 10.5 DOUBLE wide feet. Not just regularly wide, but EXTRA wide. Which explains why I haven't been able to fit into a 10 wide, or even an 11 wide, but that 11s and 12s are too long. Actually, only my toes and instep are wide; my heels are narrow. I also have a permanently swollen right ankle, and my left foot is a bit longer and wider than my right foot. And my arches are falling. Now, let's see you try to successfully find anything comfortable with all those parameters! Well, to my great surprise, these shoes actually work for me! I have had to buy men's sneakers for the past several years because I couldn't find women's shoes that were wide enough. I also absolutely HAVE to try on a lot of shoes, in the store, before I manage to find a single pair that feel good, so I was extra nervous to buy these online. I was able to get 12 wide, and they are a teeny bit more snug in the toes than I'd like, but not too long for once! They have decent arch support and they are designed to help feet that are either normal or under-pronate, as mine do, which is far less common than over-pronating. I can't use the extra holes, but I found to my delight that what looks like a decorative stripe on the top of the tongue is actually an extra loop. I threaded the laces through and crossed them, and now I can tie the laces snugly enough to keep my narrow heels in place with just a bit of movement, but the opening of the shoes are wide enough to fit my wide toes inside without undoing the laces every time! The pull loops on the backs of the heels helps to keep the heels from caving in when I slide the shoes on, too. I can tell when I wear these shoes that they are helping to correct my stance, but in case I need more support or correction, the insoles do peel out (with some effort, so I didn't try too hard). If the toe boxes are still more snug than I'd like after I get the shoes broken in,  I believe I will be able to find orthotics that are thinner in the forefoot area, with more support in the heels and arches. Or maybe for now, I'll just stuff the toes with crumpled newspaper and see if I can stretch them a tad. But to be able to even fit into women's sneakers at all is huge for me! I've worn them for a few days now, and so far, so good. I like that this color blends well with jeans, too. Having such large feet, I have no desire to draw undue attention to them with bright colors or solid black or white. I also bought different Asics for my young daughter with narrow feet, long big toes, and over-pronation, and they have worked well for her so far, too. I will stick with this brand if they wear well over the long haul. It's a relief to find good shoes that don't look like orthopedic footwear."
Asics,4,I expected the insoles to be softer. But they’re ok
Asics,4,I feel comfortable in this!
Asics,4,I had to insoles then they were perfect. The front is coming apart as well
Asics,4,"I had to return them as unfortunately they did not fit.
Unfortunately these colors were not available in the colors I wanted, so I went with the same sneakers with blue accents"
Asics,4,"I have a very narrow foot, so I had to put insoles in them.  Okay fit."
Asics,4,"I have another pair that are the same size,  and they fit perfect,  but these are a little snug. Hopefully with some wear, they will stretch out a little bit more.  Love the colors."
Asics,4,"I have arthritis in one of my feet and thought I was buying the same shoes I had purchased in a shoe store a couple years back. However, all the different shoe types are confusing. This version was not as cushioned as the ones I had, and I had to add an extra insole.  I really wish there was more support like the original version I had bought."
Asics,4,"I have been a New Balance sneaker buyer for years and wanted to try something new.  I take wide sneakers and never had any issue with NB.  Ordered these in same size - Wide, but they seem like they are not wide at all.  Unfortunately, I did not try them on until more than 30 days after I got them as it was raining a couple days so I put them aside, but then forgot about them.  But I cannot wear them.  Tried once around the block and they were squeezing my feet even loosely tied."
Asics,4,I have gone running outside 2 times now with these shoes. Very comfortable immediately but I’m not sure if they have enough cushion for my knees on the concrete. No blisters and they look and feel great but I’m going to have to see how my knees feel in the next couple weeks.
Asics,4,"I have had chronic tendonitis issues & have recovered from stress fractures in my shin. I love asics brand but unfortunately, these shoes do not give me enough heel support. These shoes are good for walking though & have become my work shoes. Love the look of them though :)"
Asics,4,"I have had more expensive Asics than this model. However, for the price, I am very happy with this shoe.  Fits well and is real comfy. Good shoe to wear with casual pants to work."
Asics,4,I have had these before that is why I was comfortable ordering a shoe online. It was as expected. The only thing I have a problem with and it is not just asics is that I poke holes in the toes. I am going to put some duct tape on the inside to see if that doesn't help.
Asics,4,I have had very active jobs for the past 15 years and Asics are the only shoes I can wear for 8 hrs straight and have my feet still feel good when I get home. Won't buy any other shoes.
Asics,4,I have Metatarsal issues (ball of foot pain) and my podiatrist recommended ASICS.  I also have arthritis in my knee. These shoes are very comfortable and I was able to find a great deal on Amazon with a wide width. It feels a little tight around the tongue area on my right foot but other than that they are a great fit. I wear an 8 D (wide) I tried them on at Dick’s first to make sure they fit before I ordered them online.
Asics,4,I have ordered this brand before but this style fits a little snug.
Asics,4,"I have wide feet and have a difficult time finding shoes in my actual size that fit. I was so excited to find these in Wide, but they are still a bit tight for me. I am keeping them hoping they'll stretch out to fit well."
Asics,4,I have wide feet and most wide 6 1/2 shoes fit well. These fit fine as long as I took the inserts out. I wore them a few days without (which kinda sucks and makes you lose a lot of the comfort) and then when they were stretched out a bit I added the inserts back in and loosened all the shoe strings. They fit fine now though if I wear the wrong socks they irritate my heels.
Asics,4,"i have worn Asics for years. This is my first pair that I was a bit disappointed with.  It runs a bit narrow, so I suggest that a M be ordered in a W. The shoe laces are of poor quality. I will be using these as a spare pair,"
Asics,4,"I have worn Asics shoes for 5 years at the recommendation of my Ortho Specialist and my son who jogs a lot! They support my one arched and archless foot. They are comfortable, Except this timne, for the first time the part of the show that comes around the ankle knob bone is causing rubbing or pressure pain. It have worn them for 2 weeks and it is getting a little better."
Asics,4,I have worn wide shoes for tge last few years and have noticed ball of my foot sliding more than I would like. I went with regular width and they feel fine with no moth toes sliding around.
Asics,4,I just wrote a review of these after I sent back the chili red and tan version because I did not like the color.  So let me start again here.  I love the Mantle green/Piedmont grey version that arrived today. A really good looking shoe.  But I'm going to leave this review at 4 stars because of minimal arch support.  Hard to understand because the Gel-Ventura 5 has a great arch support! (I've never gotten the Gel-Ventura 6 so can't speak to that) I have decided to keep them because I like the comfort of the toe box area and the heel fits perfectly and I can put in my own arch insert.
Asics,4,I like how comfortable it feels
Asics,4,I like it the way fits nicely to my feet with my insoles. I use them to walk
Asics,4,"I like my sneakers .comfortable, light a perfect fit. Crazy as it may sound, I don’t like the color of the shoe laces with the two tone sneaker ."
Asics,4,I like the fact that it was roomy at the top. I use it for walking exercie.
Asics,4,I like the lightness to it. Really comfortable. The sole find it kind of slippery.
Asics,4,I like the shoe but it's not a D width. I had to loosen the laces to the max to accommodate the high arch I have.  Keeping them as I have worn the shoe.
Asics,4,I like the shoe very much makes my feet feel good after along day of work or shopping.
Asics,4,I like the shoes but the shoe strings need to be a little bit longer.
Asics,4,I like the shoes very much.
Asics,4,I like the shoes.  I needed them as I am going to have foot surgery.  I bought in wide width and they are true wide.  Will need to replace with more of a cushion insole as these are quite hard.  Overall happy with purchase.
Asics,4,"I like the style of the shoes and I have a wide foot and they usually seem to work well for me. This time, it seems a tad bit smaller on the width but it works ok. Maybe it's just my foot so I don't want to give it a negative rating. I'll buy this brand again."
Asics,4,I like the support but the toe area is too small and narrow that I developed ingrown toenail!!
Asics,4,I like these shoes. I would love them if they had thicker inner soles and arch support.
Asics,4,"I like these sneakers, but with socks on, I felt it’s a little tight... the laces are short and come undone often when I’m walking. However, the cushioning and foot support are great"
Asics,4,"I like these, but I have an old pair that we're way more comfortable. Maybe they were the same when they were new and I just don't remember, but these are pretty tight height wise. The length and width is good, but the inside height near the base of my toes is cramped."
Asics,4,I like this shoe. It supports my plantar fasciitis. It's stylish and is comfortable.
Asics,4,"I love ASICS and I know I’m a 10, but I had to reorder these in a 10.5. So that was a headache with the COVID business. I got these for my daily walks (4 miles a day) plus using as run around shoes. The insoles are initially comfortable but do not hold up for extended walking. Granted I’m 6 months pregnant so my feet hurt a bit anyways but I’ll wake up in the morning and have excruciating pain in my arches until I get to walking around a few steps. I have slightly flat feet but nothing crazy and I’ve never had this issue with ASICS before. So I’ve swapped out the insoles for something better. I love the colors but I’m disappointed that I spent $60 on a pair of shoes that didn’t feel any better then my nearly 10 year old pair I swapped them out for."
Asics,4,I love ASICS but the shoe laces that came with this pair feel cheap and thin. I’m scared I may break them. Other shoes didn’t have this issue.
Asics,4,"I love asics shoes and that’s what I use for my entire family.  I was really excited to try the venture 7, but so far not loving it as much as my venture 6.  I’ve been using for a week, and I’m not sure if I need more time to break it in.  I’ve been walking around at home and have used on elliptical.  Not as comfortable as my venture 6.  I’ll try for another week, before I request a return.  Glad I have until February 1st to try it  and return it!"
Asics,4,"I love Asics, but these will need inserts. I wore them to work today without them, and I am 2 hours into my shift and already my feet are killing me. The insert will for sure make the shoe fit tighter than it already does, but I need better support for my arch and cushion for my heel. Beautiful shoe otherwise."
Asics,4,"I love ASICS, very comfortable. Made well. I bought these to wear at work, wish they had a solid black pair. But I love these. Helps my plantar fasciitis and lower back pain. Work every cent!!"
Asics,4,"I love my Gel-Venture 5's, but the tread is now smooth in spots. I couldn't find 6's in my size and these are the exact color that I have always wanted {the 5's were blue with pink :( }.  These are slightly lighter-weight than the 5's, but there's a noticeable difference in how much less cushioning there is.  They may be fine for just walking in, but after a couple hours of standing/shopping, my feet were killing me.  I'll keep them because I love the color scheme and they do fit."
Asics,4,"I love the brand, product and shoe. Just one thing. There is this threading inside the shoe that want to irritate my foot. I haven't returned it yet because I am on a wt. loss journey an hope I loose enough wt. before I have to return them to see if they fit better."
Asics,4,I love the cushion feel and support. I ordered Wide and it feels a little tight below my toes. I'm still going to wear them.
Asics,4,"I love the gel-venture series from Asics.  I love everything about them until this version, 7.  The shoes are still great, but the shoelaces are not as good as previous versions.  I bought shoelaces separately and will replace the original ones.  Otherwise, the shoes are just as comfortable.  I have a size 9 foot that is wider than most.  These fit fine in a 9 M.  So far, all Asics fit me well in that size."
Asics,4,I love the looks but disappointed in the fact that there is absolutely no cushion in the heel. I ordered a half size up and they fit great but I'm so sad at how uncomfortable they are.
Asics,4,I love the shoe itself. EXCEPT the picture shows a mauve/black.....and the shoe I recieved was black/gray.
Asics,4,"I love the shoes! Their very comfortable and seem to be well made. But,they were about a haft size to small."
Asics,4,"I love the shoes, but the fit is big"
Asics,4,"I love the snug fit of this shoe.  The memory foam is not a great selling point, flattens easily and there really is no arch support - I remove it to insert arch supports.  The snug fit is what I was hoping for."
Asics,4,I love these it is the second time I have purchased them.
Asics,4,I love these shoes so much I just bought my 2nd pair. I am 70 and have knee and joint pain. No more flip flops for me. My only complaint is the short shoelaces. They constantly come untied. Can’t double knot because they are too short. If not for that I would of given a 5 star. Replacing shoelaces today.
Asics,4,"I loved everything about this shoe. It's very stable while I'm running, extremely comfortable, broke in easily and gives me good arch support as I'm flat footed. Will definitely recommend it to anyone who might want a good quality shoe at a budget!"
Asics,4,"I needed to replace my old Nike Vomeros, but I wanted something more budget friendly. I also have an extra wide EE foot, high arches and a midfoot to forefoot strike while running. So far I'm happy with these shoes. I've ran and walked in them and they are comfortable. The width is good, but the shoe is up against my little toes. I will use a shoe stretcher and these will be just fine."
Asics,4,"I ordered a wide shoe. These I would classify as perhaps a medium+. Definitely not wide.  Out of the box I had to wear a thinner sock. After a few miles they loosened up a bit but still not wide.  Although the heel is quite wide.  Actually these feel more like a men’s medium.  Other than that, they’re fine for walking trails."
Asics,4,"I ordered my size because the comments said true to size but they were to small.  That being said, I love ASCIS shoes so I will by again!!"
Asics,4,I ordered these shoes just for working I was told by my doctor that they were good for plantar fasciitis they're not working like I thought but in all I like the shoe.
Asics,4,"I probably would have kept them if I had ordered the correct size.  That seems to be my problem I keep order the sneakers too big
I went to place that measured my feet I wear a 9 1/2 shoe but at active feet the salesperson said I needed size 11."
Asics,4,"I purchased the gray shoes with rose gold pattern. On the website, the pattern looks more pink but the actual color is copper (think pennies). I was a little bit disappointed but kept the shoes because they were comfortable and despite the color not being as described, they still look nice enough ."
Asics,4,I really like the color and the fit great.
Asics,4,I really like these running shoes.  I just purchased my second pair.
Asics,4,"I really like these shoes so far, the size is what I normally wear, they are a little stiff at first but I am breaking them in, I am pleased with my purchase"
Asics,4,I really like these sneakers. They look and great!
Asics,4,"I really really love the colour of these shoes first and foremost. Something different than the typical colours for women's shoes.
The fabric though, at the top of the toe box is definitely ""fragile"". I can see it easily breaking down sooner rather than later with little to no effort as far as typical wear goes. Here's to hoping though.
The other thing that doesn't affect me per se but might someone else is there is NO arch support. Very flat shoe design.
Very nice shoes regardless! Happy with my purchase."
Asics,4,I returned these because they were to big..but they did have good arch support.
Asics,4,I use them for running and try my best not to use them for anything else as instructed by my trainer.
Asics,4,I use these for walking; I have flat feet and need lots of support.  ASICS always fit my feet the best and leave room for my orthotic.
Asics,4,"I walk a lot for exercise - 3 to 5 miles a day so I need a running type shoe for enough support, especially for the ball of one of my feet. I love the last pair of ASICS I have used for the last 10 months. This new pair just doesn't have as much cushion for support as I had on this last pair.  I am just a bit disappointed but perhaps I didn't pick the right model of the running shoe."
Asics,4,"I wanted a pair of Asics after hearing great reviews about them (for walking or running). I walk 3-4 miles per day, about 5x per week. I did not want to invest too much money on them since I'd never owned a pair. These are great for the cost however, they do fit more snug around the top of my foot and ankle than expected."
Asics,4,"I wanted to like these shoes more... I previously bought a pair of ryka shoes that were literally the most comfy pair of tennis shoes I’ve ever owned... well, i decided to get a new pair but the price had drastically increased. I bought these based on the reviews and I like them- I feel like they give food support. But to me they are too bulky and the pinch my pinky toe. I don’t wear them all day like i did my Rykas. So, I’m giving them a decent review bc I think they are very good quality, but for me not the right shoes."
Asics,4,"I was concerned these would not be wide enough in the toe box, but they are fine.  Don't have quite enough arch support, but I use orthopedic inserts from Dr. Scholl's which take care of that.  They are nice looking and I appreciate being able to get a darker color, instead of the paler ones that women's shoes tend to generally be."
Asics,4,I was glad that I finally got a pair of shoes that fit with some sort of support.  They are comfortable to wear and I have some issues but nothing that would hinder me purchasing again.
Asics,4,"I was motivated to buy this particular sneaker because of the amazing give in the heel due to the gel implant. There was significant ""spring"" to it when touched and when first put on. However, that didn't last more than a few wearings. Unfortunately, the spring caused by the gel flattens out in no time and the heel becomes just like any other heel. I was disappointed with this as I was looking for a lot of give in the heel due to plantar f.  But it is still a great looking sneaker and very comfortable overall and they fit well."
Asics,4,I wear a 9 in most all shoes. Purchased a 9 in these. They are a bit narrow and quite a bit to small. I love ASICS and have several pairs that are 9. With these I would order a  half size bigger. Otherwise j love them.
Asics,4,"I wear an 11 Narrow and put arch orthotics into these shoes. They wear great for daily walks and the gym. It my first pair of Asics. I am pleased.  The brand stripe is cheap plastic looking, but the fit is great."
Asics,4,I wear them for 10+ hours and on my feet most the whole time. Love the shoes. They are very comfortable but I absolutely dislike the laces. They are very skinny and it can be hard to tie because of that. Easy fix though. Just bought a new pair of laces.
Asics,4,I wear these for work and I’m on my feet 8 hours a day. They are very comfortable and durable.
Asics,4,I wear these to work in a medical office. Comfortable all day. Very good support.
Asics,4,I went a half size up from my normal size. It fits good and is very comfortable. Overall good for price!
Asics,4,I would not recommend for working out. But a very comfortable shoe. Size is about 1/2 size small.
Asics,4,"I would not use these for ""running"".  At best, a serviceable sneaker for running errands and walking; for about a year's use with a better foot bed insert applied.  Runs slightly large, and somewhat flimsy workmanship."
Asics,4,"I would purchase them again in a larger size. The shoes was too small.
Thanks."
Asics,4,I’m new to running so I don’t know how these rate against other running sneakers. I wish they had a little more padding.
Asics,4,I’m size 9 shoe and it (9) was way too big. Otherwise extremely comfortable shoe! And cute!
Asics,4,I’ve been wearing Nimbus ASICS for 10 years & the last few years so disappointed because they have gotten uncomfortable from smaller toe boxes & less cushion. I bought these & were very surprised to find they were comfortable & fit well. I did buy 1/2 bigger than normal.
Asics,4,"I’ve been wearing these shoes every day for a few weeks now and they’re so comfortable and are holding up extremely well! My only complaint is that when they were shipped to me, they still had a security dye pack on the side of the shoe, I was able to get it off and they did offer help me send back the shoes to get another pair or to take the tag off."
Asics,4,"If you're wearing this as a daily shoe, your regular size probably a good fit. I bought these as a trail running shoe. I wear a 10.5 in my asics street running shoes so I ordered a10.5 in these.  They are however a 1/2 size too small. If I trail run in these my toes hit the front of the box,  not comfortable. So if you're planning on running in these,  size up a 1/2 size.  I wear my to walk the dog and run errands now abs they're ok for that."
Asics,4,I'm a server and use them for a work shoe.  Good and sturdy
Asics,4,I'm not crazy about the shoelaces in these shoes. However I love the shoes!
Asics,4,"I'm on my feet 12+ hours a day and these are my go-to shoes for work. Being on my feet and walking around on concrete floors, these have been the most comfortable shoe to wear without having to put in an insert.  I've worn Nike, Adidas and Reebok among others and hands down, Asics are the best for comfort on your feet all day and they're decently priced!"
Asics,4,"I'm on my feet all day at work, and these are very comfortable shoes for me."
Asics,4,I'm pleased with this purchase.  The sneaker is comfortable as well as nice looking.  I hope they last a longgggg time.
Asics,4,"In my hand the feel heavier than what I am accustomed to wearing so I was hesitant about wearing them. But I was impressed on how good they feel on my feet, not heavy at all."
Asics,4,"In these sneakers I size up a half size. They were comfortable for my Zumba gold class.  I haven’t tried them for walking yet.
ASICS is my go to sneaker for exercising. Their fit is reliable."
Asics,4,"It fits well and I broke it in really fast, very comfortable for short hikes and trail running. I hiked a moderate To easy 11 mile hike and the bottom top of my left foot was aching. There’s not even sole support, probably need to add a supplement support sole. But for my shorter hikes, 4 miles and 3x a week, it’s great. Otherwise, love the color and fit for my wide feet."
Asics,4,It has great support but the heel goes up and down if you have a narrow heel.
Asics,4,It is a comfortable shoe for me because I have a wide foot and high arch.
Asics,4,It is a little to big I should of take a 10 instead
Asics,4,It took three times to get the right size. These are long enough but plenty of room in the front part of the shoe.
Asics,4,It was okay
Asics,4,It wasn’t as cushiony as I would have liked. I put in a gel pad and it’s good
Asics,4,It’s not as wide as I expected but my friend fits so she owns  it.
Asics,4,"I've been wearing Asics Gel Venture for my last 5 pairs of every day sneakers. Needless to say, I really like them. The fit is perfect for my size 9 feet (I buy 9.5 as they seem to run a half size small) and I generally like the style and color choices.
This model (GV7) has more padding in the tongue. When lacing them up, the big padded tongue sticks through the laces like a roast that's been trussed. It really makes the shoe look like a sneaker that Granny's doctor told her she needed to wear. Not the sleek trail runners that Asics has made for the past 4 models. The blue color helps, but I wish they had kept the design the way it was."
Asics,4,"I've bought Asics for the past 10+ years because they fit my feet the best. I always get size 10. I bought two pairs of Asics, this pair and a light pink colored pair that was on clearance from Asics website. These gray ones run slightly small. If you're a size 10, get a 10.5. (my pink pair I bought directly from Asics fit as expected.)"
Asics,4,"I've played volleyball for many years so I knew going into this purchase what to expect from Asics. I knew asics ran tighter than most sneakers so I ordered a wide.
PROS: great arch support, great looking shoe, lots of grip, lightweight, breathable
CONS: even with a wide its still too tight in the heel/back half of the shoe."
Asics,4,"I've worn this brand in the past and the shoes hold up very well.  Comfortable, no rubbing, just put them on and go."
Asics,4,JUST GOT TRIED ON  FEELS GOOD NOT WORN YET JUST RECEIVED  HOPE FEELS GOOD WEARING THEM THE FIT IS GOOD I NORMALLY WEAR 7 GOT 7 WHILE BACK LITTLE TIGHT SO GOT 7.5 AND WILL PUT GEL INNERSOLES IN
Asics,4,just what I ordered
Asics,4,"Lightweight, nice color, feels a little flimsy, not real arch support"
Asics,4,like the look
Asics,4,"Like the shoe, just runs small. I normally wear a women’s 9, could have stood a 9 1/2."
Asics,4,Little short in toe room for 6.5
Asics,4,Little snug. I only get ASICS but I prefer the gel 6 better
Asics,4,Look
Asics,4,Look great but too small. Ordered bigger size. Hope they fit.
Asics,4,Love color. Size was as expected and comfortable for always being on my feet.
Asics,4,Love the color and fit
Asics,4,Love the color and fit is great!
Asics,4,Love the color and support
Asics,4,"Love the colors! They are non slip and pretty comfortable! Great light weight, breathable shoe... It would be nicer if they had better arch and ball of the food support, but they are a great value for the money! I am happy with them overall!"
Asics,4,Love the fit of the shoes and the color. The pink isn’t too bright which is exactly what I wanted.
Asics,4,Love the fit!!
Asics,4,"Love the look and style of the shoe, but they run very small! I sent one size back and half sized up and they’re still too small! 😢"
Asics,4,Love the shoes.
Asics,4,Love the sneakers. Great support. Listed as black and silver- actually navy and Iight blue
Asics,4,"Love these shoes! I wear a lot of grey around the house due to dog hairs. The colors work well together and I love Rose Gold. I am plus size woman. Need 10 1/2 and so excited these were available. One foot is always slightly bigger than your other and I can tell. The right one is a little tighter or not wide enough than compared to my left show. Didn't know that the show strings now come thinner than in most shoes I have own. Not the thick rounded type. Overall, they fit well. Support my feet as each person is different. I would buy again!"
Asics,4,Love these sneakers very comfortable
Asics,4,"Love these! I have ASICS, but needed a new pair since they were getting old.  Fit as expected, but the colors are slightly off from the picture. The ones I got were on sale— I was expecting blue and orange based on all the pics, but the bottom is not orange- it’s pink.  The threading looks orange on the sneaker, but the bottom part of the rubber is definitely pink.  Other than that they are great!"
Asics,4,Loved the color and comfort. Was ready for the supermarket run straight out the box.
Asics,4,"lovely pair of shoes  - sturdy and supportive and I love the  colors.  Have used ASICS for years and love their shoes for the comfort.  I have medium width feet and while the 'body"" of this particular shoe is comfortable I find the toebox to be a  bit narrow.  Am hoping that after a couple weeks of use it will stretch.  If so will update my rating to 5 stars"
Asics,4,"Mostly comfortable, but something was rubbing on the top side that was uncomfortable the first few wears."
Asics,4,"Muy pequeño, mi número es el 8 pero este me queda pequeño."
Asics,4,My daughter was reluctant to get these shoes. I insisted that she get a nice pair with a wide toe box because she's on her feet all day. After the first day of wearing them I rarely see her in anything else. She loves them and can stand and walk all day without the pain she was so used to.
Asics,4,"My heal lifts a bit, a thicker sock solved the problem."
Asics,4,"My knees are very thankful. Shock absorbing, right fit. A women's half size without having to buy a man's equivalent."
Asics,4,"My only complaint is that the shoes didn't arrive until yesterday, when I was supposed to get them no later than 12/11/20."
Asics,4,"My package arrived and when I unboxed them, the security tag is still on the left shoe."
Asics,4,"My second pair if these. Cute, sturdy, comfortable."
Asics,4,My wife loves it very comfortable
Asics,4,My wife's feet been killing her since she's been wearing the asics her feet feel much better at work she loves her asics compared to new balance or Nike
Asics,4,"Needed a comfortable!, durable shoe for my pack testing.  Worked great without costing a fortune."
Asics,4,"Needed to break in, last version was a fit right out of the box. Comfortable after broken in. I would buy again."
Asics,4,Nice and sturdy shoe would like just a little bit of added cushion
Asics,4,"Nice bright colors, great support, just a tad bulky. The toe box is a little small and it hurts for some time after I’ve taken the shoes off. I’ve been trying to break it in for a while now, hopeful it will get better. Sizing is a snug  good fit so size up if you’re in between.
Overall, it’s really great apart from the slightly tight toe box (which could be relative based on how your feet are shaped)"
Asics,4,"nice color, bright and colorful. Comfortable,"
Asics,4,Nice looking shoes - just too short for me so had to return
Asics,4,Nice looking sneaker. Didnt look so casual like a sneaker.
Asics,4,Nice product. Unfortunately They are not wide enough to accommodate my orthotics .
Asics,4,"Nice shoes,  good for running. Moreover,  if you have plantar fasciitis, this shoe will give you the support and comfort that you need."
Asics,4,Nice style and design. Just run too small.
Asics,4,"Nice, but need more cushioning."
Asics,4,"Not all colors fit equally...quality control issue? I ordered two different colors, (black/silver which actually look purple, and carrier grey/silver with the pink accents) both in an 8 Wide bc that's what worked for me with the gel venture 6. The black/silver ones were too small and I almost ordered up half a size, but upon trying on the carrier grey/silver, realized that it was just a strangely constructed shoe. The other color fit fine."
Asics,4,Not as comfortable as I would have expected
Asics,4,"Not as comfortable as other asics, i have been purchasing for many years."
Asics,4,Not as cushioned in the sole as other sneakers of the same type. Will need inserts
Asics,4,"Not as much arch support as the 6, which is a bummer. Also runs smaller than the 6. I sort of can't wait to wear these out and get a different pair, maybe the 6's again. Good quality otherwise!!!"
Asics,4,"Not that it mattered to me but these shoes are not black and silver, as the box states, they are navy blue.  Fairly comfortable as far as padding, I would still add a Dr. Scholls thin pad for more comfort, seemed a little short so I did have to return them. My first time trying ASICS so perhaps they simply fit a bit shorter than the Sauconys I'm used to."
Asics,4,"Not the best sneakers, if your trying to find something comfortable after foot surgery"
Asics,4,Nothing
Asics,4,Ordered my usual size and they were too small. I ordered a 1/2 size up.
Asics,4,"Originally I gave these 5 stars. But after my run today, I noticed the lining in the fabric by the heel is coming apart after 3 months. I researched a lot before I bought and I had high hopes for these shoes. I run 3 times per week, so 3 months of use before this happened is sad."
Asics,4,"Originally, I had ordered in a 9W and found that they were just a little too small in length and width. I went up half size and are perfect. I'm glad I did. I'm very happy with fit, but I don't use these for working out because my feet swell too much. I use men's sneakers for working out because they run wider than women's sneakers. I use these sneakers for casual use."
Asics,4,"Overall shoes are fine but I’d still go for gel venture 5 over 6 and 7. It’s bit smaller near toes area and not as comfortable as my previous gel venture 5. Although they’re better than venture 6. Also, the real color is a lot different than displayed."
Asics,4,Perfect for my old injuries
Asics,4,Pretty but too narrow for me and im w
Asics,4,"Pretty good shoe.  I have high arches so wish the bottom of the tongue was wider, because as my feet swell this spot starts to hurt on my foot. The insole could be a lil softer too."
Asics,4,Product is as expected.
Asics,4,Product is true to size.  Fits very comfortably. Plenty of toe room.
Asics,4,Quality is great. They are supportive but a bit clunky.
Asics,4,Quality shoe ! happy customer
Asics,4,"REally nice, but after 20 minutes, my toes feel squeezed together.  Otherwise, great shoes."
Asics,4,"Rub a little on little toe, but size is what I wear and the are comfortable. I wear a wide shoe and these are pretty good"
Asics,4,"Rubber used for sole does not have the flexibility of real rubber
I got wide width, it’s narrow for that
I don’t expect them to last as well as I would expect
I could not ethically return them as I’d worn them outdoors"
Asics,4,Sad they were too small even though this is the brand of shoe I have used for years.
Asics,4,Shape s as no material held up well for daily wear for about a year. Then holes appeared in fabric. Withstood washing machine without becoming deformed.
Asics,4,Shoe is cut a little small. No problem we gave to our daughter and they fit her fine.
Asics,4,Shoe laces are made of very poor material and quality.  Otherwise the fit and the confort is what you expect from Asics.  Although I love the prior version more.
Asics,4,shoe offers proper arch support and snug enough in toe box to prevent blistering that I had with other brands.  Good tread and support for normal walking or light hiking.  I got 2 pairs in Spring 2020 that worked out so well that I bought 3 more pair to put on the shelf for next year.
Asics,4,Shoes are comfortable and provide excellent cushion to absorb impact from running.
Asics,4,Shoes felt too small under the tongue. No matter how much I tried to loosen the laces. My only reason I had to return.
Asics,4,Shoes fit as expected
Asics,4,Shoes r comfy and feel great on. Hope they endure my running and walking routines.
Asics,4,Siempre compramos este tipo de tenis para hacer ejercicios
Asics,4,"Size was perfect, very comfortable and lightweight."
Asics,4,"So this was my first pair of ASICS tennis shoes, I usually wear sketchers, new balance, or Nike. I needed a walking/running shoe for outdoor exercise, and I wanted a shoe that had great shock absorption, comfort, and support. These were offered a reasonable price, so I figured that I’d try them as opposed to having to spend so much money on a new pair of Nike shoes. They fit as sized, shipping was super fast, and the shoes were definitely brand new.

I just wore them for the first time yesterday while exercising outside, and at first they felt great but about an hour later the back of my heel began to hurt. Once I got back home and took them off, I had two open and bleeding sores on the back of both of my heels, and I was wearing them with socks so this happened through the sock. Suffice it to say I was not happy about that at all. Maybe I should have went a half size down to stop this from occurring and I bought these in a size 8. My friend said that maybe the shoes just need to be broken in and it would eventually stop, I’m not so sure about that. I will try to add heel cushions to them and see if that helps, if not I don’t think that I will be able to continue wearing them. But, it’s a good looking shoe."
Asics,4,Standing on concrete floors.
Asics,4,Super cute olive green/gray/hot pink! Very comfortable and supportive!
Asics,4,"The Asics sneakers are very comfortable, I work in a kitchen with old tile and concrete under. They give me support and at end of day my legs and back are well. Depending on how you use them they are woth the money. I do find that I need new ones every  9 to 12 months,because of the work I do. These are my 3rd pair. I would recommend them."
Asics,4,"The color certainly does not look black in the sunshine. It has a bluish-purple tint and is noticeable against black pants. Other than that, they are comfortable so far."
Asics,4,The color of the shoe is darker than I expected and the shoe is a bit heavier than expected but it'll do.
Asics,4,The quality of the product less than expected.
Asics,4,"The seller sent a wide instead of a regular as listed in the product description.  Decided to keep them despite this issue, so I have to lace them up a bit tighter.  I cannot find my size in a regular width anywhere."
Asics,4,"The shoe is a great fit but it starts to wear out noticeably in a month, after three months it is pretty much done for the count."
Asics,4,"The shoe is great
I had to return due to having a bunion on my right foot and it rubbed it"
Asics,4,"The shoe itself is fine. I did notice that the color Black/Silver appeared blue before I bought it. I'm colorblind, so I couldn't tell from the picture if it was black or blue. I chose black/Silver thinking maybe it would come black and silver, but it came blue and another color. I'm gonna keep them because I need new shoes and they feel like sturdy shoes. I just thought they would come black/silver. Color doesn't matter. They work fine and feel good quality."
Asics,4,"The shoes are a bit wide for me,but,overall a good shoe so far.comfotsble"
Asics,4,The shoes are very comfortable.
Asics,4,"The shoes look great and appear to be well made, but the ""Wide"" width is still very narrow. We ordered a 10W but  the Venture 7's fit more like a medium width. The box nor the shoe indicated the width, so we returned to Amazon thinking they might have sent the wrong shoe. We ordered another 10W from a different seller, but the results were the same."
Asics,4,The shoes' toe box was a little tighter than expected and the shoes in general were a little stiffer. I've been ordering these shoes for years and I'd keep ordering them. Nice for hiking in Florida.
Asics,4,"The shoes were as expected and great for a standard foot.  However, I had to return as the width was not wide enough.  These fit the same in the toe area as my Asics that are not wide width."
Asics,4,"The shoes were attractive and exactly as pictured but were sized extremely small.  I normally wear size 10 and that is what I ordered but when I put them on, my toes were up against the end of the shoe.  Rather than return them I gave them to my granddaughter, who normally wears size 9, and they fit perfectly.  She says they are very comfortable."
Asics,4,The size is spot on and the fit is good
Asics,4,The sneakers came exactly on time and look and feel great.
Asics,4,There wasn’t as much cushioning as I was hoping for with my bad knees but they seem to still be supporting me well. Slightly larger than my other shoes of the same size.
Asics,4,These always fit as expected. Cheap looking but comfy
Asics,4,These are actually wide enough for my feet. And they're comfortable withouthaving to break them in! The only thing I wish it had was more arch support.
Asics,4,"These are comfortable and give good support for the most part, but I wear them to work, where an 8-hour shift is spent mostly on my feet and occasionally my feet hurt, which is a first in an Asics shoe.  Also, my aggressive right big toe keeps poking out of the fabric part after a few months.  I also use them for walking the dogs, usually about a mile at a time, which works well."
Asics,4,These are great shoes.  Comfortable with lots of support. I had a torn maniscus fixed a few years ago and these shoes give me the support i need.  Love them and would buy them again!
Asics,4,These are NOT black and silver. They are dark purple and blue
Asics,4,These are so comfy and I love the look .
Asics,4,"These do have a bit of a tougher sole. As someone who is on their feet all day for work, these shoes have served me well."
Asics,4,These fit very well. Just not enough arch support for me.  Loved the colors.
Asics,4,These must run a little short. I wear a 7 but in sneakers I wear a 7.5. I would need an 8 in these for my toes to not touch the end of the shoes.
Asics,4,These ran a little smaller than my other Asics.
Asics,4,"These seemed really great.  Unfortunately I have to return them - they were a little too big as a 9 wide. I normally wear a 9.  But I think bc they are in fact a true wide sneaker - I wouldn’t need the full size 9 that I normally go with to accommodate my wide toes.  I would like to try an 8 1/2 wide instead and will update.  They felt really comfortable!  If you are on the fence or used to “sizing up” in a regular sneaker for more space for your wide feet, don’t do that here.  Do the half size down!"
Asics,4,These shoes are a good fit and are nice and light for walking or running. I wear a larger size and it’s hard to find comfortable running shoes. ASICS always work for me and I love the bright colors.
Asics,4,These shoes are exactly what I wanted but they are too big. I've purchased this brand before and not had a problem. Luckily I have someone who can fit these but they feel more like 9.5 instead of a 9.
Asics,4,"These shoes are great because I purchased insolds for them.  They do not come with sufficient arch or cushion.  However, unlike other running shoes, I had plenty of room to add cushion and support without the shoe feeling too loaded down."
Asics,4,"These shoes are so lightweight and comfortable! They are great for running. The only thing I dislike is that the tongue likes to slide sideways a bit, even after tightening the laces a little. Other than that they're great! I would give them 4.5 stars if that was an option."
Asics,4,"These shoes are true to size, the toe-box might be a tiny bit too tight but not enough to send them back, I'll break them in. I'd say if you are on the fence between regular and wide, order a wide. These shoes are alright but they aren't top quality either. I am on my feet all day so I wear them at work and they are good enough. If i was a runner, they wouldn't be my first choice."
Asics,4,"These shoes are very comfortable, however, they do run a little wide, so my feet tend to slide around in them, which means I can't wear them if I'm going to do a lot of walking.  They're great for running errands, etc. Love the colors."
Asics,4,"These shoes are very comfortable, lightweight and have a lovely design. My feet never feel sweaty when I wear these, they have great moisture control. They are great for running on the track or on a trail!"
Asics,4,These shoes are very nice and comfy but I feel as though they are about a half size too small.  I only use them if I am not walking a lot.  I ordered another pair a half size larger that I can use for exercising and walking.
Asics,4,"These shoes fit well and are everything I expect from ASICS trainers. The only disappointment is the colour. The description says black and silver but they are more a faded, dusty navy. The image is close to the real colour. I kept them even though I already have a navy pair."
Asics,4,"These shoes have zero arch support, but it also helps to know what type of arches you have. After wearing them for two runs I started to develop a soreness on the middle right of my foot. I bought some Dr. Scholes for them and they have been way better."
Asics,4,"These shoes were made for walkin' & that's exactly why I purchased this brand. Durable, well made and a nearly no-twist shoe that gives my almost flat feet the support they need for trekking through amusement parks, national parks, zoos and the like. I went in to a shoe retailer to try on several different styles and these, with the GEL, were the most comfy for me. This exact style was $120 in the store, but the color selection was minimal. I was able to choose a color I wanted, instead of what was left. These look to be something that will last me for many miles of happy adventures."
Asics,4,"These sneakers are awesome for cross train and cardio, I’ve always lived ASICS for my wide feet!"
Asics,4,"They are comfortable, just need to get used to the shoes. I do highly recommend these shoes!"
Asics,4,"They are great product and made well. The soles offer right amount of cushion and support. Wife ordered the wide because her feet are a little fat. She can sometimes wear shoes that aren't wide depending on the brand. These shoes felt like regular non wide shoes, but tag does say wide. She still loves them and says they are breaking in great."
Asics,4,They are nice shoes with great color and price.  I am looking for more ankle support for running.
Asics,4,"They are very narrow and I have narrow feet. If you plan to use an orthotic, get wide"
Asics,4,They came quickly--fit great--comfortable to walk in.  The only unknown is their longevity.
Asics,4,They feel comfortable. They said according to size. They make my feet sweat more than I thought they would.
Asics,4,They feel great but run a little big.
Asics,4,They fit and feel comfortable. I wear them 8+ hours a day at work.
Asics,4,"They fit well, still trying to break them in."
Asics,4,"They ran a little small but I sent back a size 8.5 and reordered a size 9 wide. They are a little tight but I think with wear, they will stretch out and be okay. Support is great. I don't have to put in an additional support because I have flat feet."
Asics,4,They were comfortable.
Asics,4,They’re just  titch h  too tight but with some wear & tear they should loosen up.
Asics,4,"They're perfect, yet not ideal for me. Materials are excellent and the shoes are well made. They're just not helping me at all with the arch support I need."
Asics,4,This is a good shoe but for my bunion it was a little snug
Asics,4,"This is a good shoe that I had before.  The only thing that was misleading was your description that the shoe is black and silver, but in fact the shoe is navy.  I wouldn’t have bought it if I knew it was navy."
Asics,4,"This is my third pair. Most shoes I wear size 8, these I get in 8.5"
Asics,4,"This is the 3rd pair of Asics I have owned. The shoe itself fits like the other ones but I don't think it's made as good as my previous pairs. The mesh on top seems thin and the shoelaces are very thin. However, the fit is as usual. I wear an 8 1/2 and I have wide feet. I bought the regular fit though, not the wide and they fit perfect."
Asics,4,This is to replace another pair of Asics.  I like how they fit and wear.
Asics,4,This is very narrow for a wide. If you have wide feet even the W will be narrow.
Asics,4,"This product fits fine, but the color listed on the site and on the box is not the color I received. Honestly, it doesn't much matter to me, as I'm buying for comfort and support, but if buying for a specific color, buyer beware."
Asics,4,"This product was good, I was expecting the in soles to have more cushion.  They're good not great."
Asics,4,This shoe fit as expected and was comfortable to wear from the start.
Asics,4,This sneaker does not have the arch support other Asics have
Asics,4,"This was my first time trying Asics. It's a well made shoe and I really liked the colors. The only thing that kept me from getting them is, unfortunately the sides were too high for my foot and hit just under my ankle bone. I had to return them : ("
Asics,4,"Toe box is a tad narrow. She strings that come with the shoes are almost too short to lace them all the way up. Arch support is pretty good, and does help with my over pronation. These shoes do a great job for a great price. This review was written after wearing the shoes for 9 hours, standing on concrete floors, over a week's time."
Asics,4,"Ugly shoe in person, but comfortable. Sufficient padding around the ankle for support.
The sizing in this shoe seems to be different to other asics models. I normally wear a size 9 ladies, but this shoe seems a little larger."
Asics,4,"Un poco chico, son cómodos, las fintas son pequeñas y la lengua también.
Muy lindo color"
Asics,4,"Using this product for a walking shoe for support and a longer lasting heel and sole
 Material"
Asics,4,"Very comfortable and I love the pink tones. The shoes don’t provide a lot of ankle support so they probably would not be good for sports but they do great for me since I primarily use them while using the elliptical and while running.

Cute for daily wear running errands as well."
Asics,4,Very comfortable and lightweight. A lot of mud can get packed into the bottoms- so check before walking into the house after a run!
Asics,4,Very comfortable and supportive shoe !
Asics,4,Very comfortable I like them
Asics,4,Very comfortable I love them
Asics,4,Very comfortable sneaker from the moment I put them on. Good arch support. My one complaint are the shoelaces. They are thin and flimsy. I’ll just replace them.
Asics,4,"Very comfortable, but a little clunky. Could definitely have ordered a regular width and had plenty of room"
Asics,4,"Very comfortable, true to size"
Asics,4,Very comfortable. My feet are happy.
Asics,4,"Very good looking sneaker just a bit tight at the front end of the shoe, should have ordered wider width."
Asics,4,"Very happy with the shoe. Comfortable, sized well, love the style and color"
Asics,4,"Very nice looking, somewhat comfortable and the reason for saying this is, that my feet tend to slide forward and the inner seam around the big toe has bulky fabric sticking out and is rubbing  on my toe, which starts hurting after wearing it a couple of hours.
Other than  that they are very lightweight and comfortable"
Asics,4,Very pleased with the fit and comfort
Asics,4,Walking-ease of ordering on line.
Asics,4,Wears these all the time and are already wearing down after 3 months
Asics,4,"Well, they definitely aren't wide. Love the look, and they'd be perfect if they were wide."
Asics,4,"What I expect: fits, comfortable and only time will tell if they are durable"
Asics,4,"While I love the shoes (have ordered several over time) I noticed that the construction quality is lacking.  Small tongue, threads coming loose, etc.  Disappointed."
Asics,4,Wide is not quite as wide as I would like
Asics,4,Wide shoe
Asics,4,Women's Gel-Venture 7 fit more narrow then expected. Once we got the right width the wife loves them and wears them daily.
Asics,4,Work shoes
Asics,4,Would like half size measurements in larger shoes.
Asics,4,Would like to have a shoe with more support for my high arch.  Shoe fits according to size and looks good.
Asics,4,Would recommend this shoe
New_Balance,4,"A great looking pair of sneakers,they just run smaller than expected. I'm returning."
New_Balance,4,A little more arch support would be nice
New_Balance,4,A little on the snug side but otherwise a very comfortable sneaker.
New_Balance,4,A little small
New_Balance,4,A little tight on my feet but I like them so far.
New_Balance,4,"A little too big. A regular 8.5 would have been better, but I’ve already returned these shoes twice, so I’m just going to keep them. Thought I would wear them every day, but I don’t now.. not as comfortable as when I tried them on in the store"
New_Balance,4,a mi hija le encanto son cómodos y el modelo es mas lindo físicamente
New_Balance,4,A thin shoe.  Not supportive to foot.  Not what I needed.
New_Balance,4,"A tight fit, I usually wear a 9-9.5 and these seem small. I ordered a 9.5, tight fit"
New_Balance,4,"A very comfortable shoe, a tiny bit narrow in the toe box even in a wide width.  The fit is OK with a very thin sock, even better barefoot.  They do have a rather thick memory foam insole, other than that I would describe them on a sliding scale of 1 to 10 ( A 1 being a minimalist zero drop  running shoe and a 10 being a full cushioned running shoe) as around a 3-4.  Thought about removing the memory foam insole and replacing with a rock plate."
New_Balance,4,Absolutely nothing negative about this shoe. My feet are slightly different sizes from a severe crush injury to one foot long long ago. My feet feel so good in these shoes. Definitely the most comfortable shoe for me. Walk for hours very comfortably.
New_Balance,4,accurate description and fast shipping
New_Balance,4,"After reading reviews, I ordered a half size larger. It was still too small. Had to reorder 1 size larger. Much better but toe room could be larger in my opinion."
New_Balance,4,Beautiful shoes. My only problem was I ordered a 8 and they sent me a 8 wide. I returned them and ordered again a 8 and got a 8 wide again. Ended up keeping them cause they were out of my size.
New_Balance,4,"Because I ordered this shoe in wide, I expected the toe box to be.. well wider.. but instead it fits like a standard shoe. They are cute and comfy enough, but it isn't a shoe I would work out in, and maybe if I ordered a size up I might feel differently."
New_Balance,4,"Bought these for my daughter who has pretty wide feet and is really hard on her shoes.  These have held up really well, especially in the toe.  Her biggest complaint is that the laces never stay tied because they’re too slippery."
New_Balance,4,"Bought these for my girlfriend. She really likes the look of the shoe and says it comfortable with one exception. She didn’t like how the heel support was digging into her heels when she work low cut or “no show” socks. The rubbing on her heel annoyed her. This may not be the case for other people. But it did feel better once when she wore higher cut socks. It was enough for her to decide to keep the shoes. The shoes do run small. She wears a 7.5 sneakers across all of the major brands. And she’s worn 7.5 in New Balances before but for some reason these felt small to her so she had to exchange them for a size 8. And she does have wide fee by any means. Other than that, she said she really likes them. Hope this helps."
New_Balance,4,Bought these for my wife. She loved them and mentioned they were very comfortable. The only thing is that they fitted a bit small other than that no complains.
New_Balance,4,"Bought these for work as a nurse. Super light, comfortable. Have worn them to exercise a couple of times and I prefer a firmer bottom for lifting but they're probably great for other types of exercise."
New_Balance,4,"Bought these to work in ,I’m on my feet for 8 straight, they are light and feet don’t sweat , would go up half a size though, great price got mine for $35"
New_Balance,4,"But the “wide” is very wide, with less than average arch support"
New_Balance,4,By far these are the most comfortable shoes I have purchased. After a while of walking the back part start to scratch my ankle making it painful. I wear ankle socks so idk why it does this
New_Balance,4,"Comes too small, had to send back for a larger size, and it still kind of tight. Didn't feel better until I began 2 wear them for a while. I still feel like I could have gotten a whole size larger instead of a half a size larger."
New_Balance,4,Comfortable
New_Balance,4,Comfortable
New_Balance,4,Comfortable and cushion-able but they do run a bit smaller than expected
New_Balance,4,"Comfortable and easy to slip on an go. I'd theyvare available in other colors, I have to find them."
New_Balance,4,Comfortable and looks really nice just wasn’t nonslip as it was categorized. But very comfortable
New_Balance,4,Comfortable but not a lot of support.
New_Balance,4,Comfortable but the shoe is a little wider than average. I have normal width foot so it rubs a little when walking.
New_Balance,4,Comfortable for my wide feet.
New_Balance,4,Comfortable great fit
New_Balance,4,comfortable right away. had to order up 1/2 size as they run short. the laces don't really do much other than look good.
New_Balance,4,"Comfortable shoe, wish it had more support on upper shoe.  Since the laces section is shorter when it is tightened is creates a small folding across the top.  No support on the sides.  Runs a bit small - I sized up 1/2 a size and glad I did.  Would I buy these again? - no, would look for something with more support but since they were so inexpensive they'll be ok till the next pair."
New_Balance,4,"Comfortable shoe. Wear 7.5, but had to buy 8.5 in this shoe."
New_Balance,4,"Comfortable, lightweight, and cute. The support does not last long when wearing to work daily though."
New_Balance,4,"Comfortable, runs about 1/2 size smaller than usual"
New_Balance,4,Comfortable. But shoe started to squeak with walking after a couple weeks. Sort of annoying walking down a quiet hallway at work. No sneaking up on people
New_Balance,4,Comfortable. Very stylish. Have gotten quite a few compliments.
New_Balance,4,Comfy and airy with good support.
New_Balance,4,"Comfy shoe but runs small.  I ordered a 6 which normally runs a bit big for me, but these shoes are tighter than most.  Not a lot of extra room.  I am not sure I could wear thick socks with them.  They are comfortable.  Tongue is part of shoe so your foot has to slide in (cannot pull it up to allow more room for foot to slide in)."
New_Balance,4,"Comfy shoe, although i did add an insert for plantar fasciitis. Only problem is, the wide isnt really that wide. I wear them for 10+ hours and theyre holding up"
New_Balance,4,"Comfy shoe, love that it slips on and love the look. Very light weight. Sizing is very small. I am a solid size 6 in almost every shoe I own. I had to go to a 7 in this shoe (and really if I planned to run in them I would have to go 7.5)."
New_Balance,4,"Comfy, but the sole feels thin, not quite as much support as I expected. Still a good shoe."
New_Balance,4,Comfy. Feels like you are wearing nothing.
New_Balance,4,Cool.  Lightweight and comfortable.  I did add an additional sole due to using on concrete floor for 8+ hours in warehouse but probably wouldn’t need for casual wear.
New_Balance,4,Cute - comfy. Perfect for the gym!
New_Balance,4,Cute and comfortable for light walking and running errands. I’m a little disappointed that they are snug at the toes. I would recommend going half a size up when ordering.
New_Balance,4,"Cute and comfortable for running errands, but my feet hurt after long walks or exercise in them. They lace but also slip on without being untied which is a plus for me! I’d buy them again for causal wear."
New_Balance,4,Cute shoe but fit very small and tight across top and toes. I wear a 10 and my daughter a 9 and the size 10 didn’t fit either of us.
New_Balance,4,Cute shoes but contrary to popular opinion I felt they ran small. Exchanging for a half size up.
New_Balance,4,"Cute shoes but my feet are skinny. If you tie the laces tight, the elastic band around the top does not adjust so it looks funny. (At least I couldn’t figure out how to adjust it)"
New_Balance,4,"Cute, but runs small & definitely narrow. Size up."
New_Balance,4,"Cute, comfy, lite weight shoes, great for REFIT & Zumba dance classes, but runs a half size too small."
New_Balance,4,Decent pair of shoes for the price. I’ve been wearing them for a few months and they seem to be holding up well. Comfy light weight shoes.
New_Balance,4,"Decent shoe, defly started hurting day 5 on the arch."
New_Balance,4,"Definitely get a half size up from what you would normally wear or they will be snug! Also, if you're looking for no-slip shoes these are not it. Otherwise, very comfortable and seem to be good shoes! I have to return because of the sizing issue. :("
New_Balance,4,"Definitely not a running shoe as there isn't much cushioning for hard surfaces like cement.
I bought a 7.5 which I usually wear but they were too small in the toe box. Order half size up and they are good.
Warning, if you have wide feet these should really only be worn for short periods at the gym or casually. They are pretty narrow across the ball of the foot, but SUPER stylish, so I'm keeping these puppies."
New_Balance,4,Didn't know what a difference a good pair of trainers could make.  Very light and comfortable.
New_Balance,4,Don't care much for the elastic band over top of foot.
New_Balance,4,Exactly what I expected! Great fit
New_Balance,4,Extremely comfortable but run short; maybe due to a smaller tor box
New_Balance,4,"Extremely narrow for small foot women
I’m a 10W and I ordered a 10.5 for width and still these were too small"
New_Balance,4,Feel a little snug with thicker socks so I wear thinner no show type of socks. They are super light weight. When the box arrived my first thought was that there better be sneakers in this box. They slip on and don’t cause me discomfort. I wish the memory foam inserts were a little thicker but my feet don’t hurt so maybe it’s fine. They look great with yoga pants and with jeans.
New_Balance,4,Feels great when you're on your feet during a shift. Very attractive looking shoes. I have 2 pairs: work and personal.
New_Balance,4,"First off, these shoes are reasonably comfy. The arch support is nice, the heel cushion is great and the shoes are light weight. The style is very cute and isn't too loud or flashy. All that being said, be sure to size up! I read the reviews and most said to size up 1/2 a size. I wish I would've gone up a full size instead of half. I usually wear a size 8 (Nike, Adidas & Under Armor). I ordered an 8.5 but wish I would've gotten a 9. My toes feel squished and pressed to the top of the shoe, and that's with thin sock liners on. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."
New_Balance,4,Fit as expected I did not order the correct size.
New_Balance,4,"Fit as expected, runs true to size"
New_Balance,4,"Fit is good, but just a bit narrow on my toes.  I bought them for longer walks, and not worn them long yet."
New_Balance,4,Fit is perfect
New_Balance,4,Fit very good and very comfortable.
New_Balance,4,"Fits comfortable .  Work as a ER clinical staff for up to 13 hours per shift and , this sneaker make it very comfortable for to run around ."
New_Balance,4,For me this shoe ran slightly smaller.  Approx 1/2 size smaller.  I gave them to my daughter and she loves them.
New_Balance,4,FOR ME THIS WIDE SIZE IS JUST NOT TOO WIDE ENOUGH AND NEXT TIME I WILL ORDER ONE SIZE BIGGER SO THE TOE BOX WILL GIVE MY FEET MORE ROOM WHEN I WEAR THICKER SOCKS.  SO I HAVE SIZE 7 1/2 WIDE NOW BUT I WILL ORDER 8 WIDE NEXT TIME.
New_Balance,4,"For my wife, she says:

PROS: Flattering to my legs. Goes with lots of workout outfits. Does the job of taking miles off my expensive running shoes. Used for cross training, they do the job.

CONS: is it really memory foam? Feels so cheap and lacks cushioning. But this may be in comparison to my very supportive running shoes."
New_Balance,4,"Fun, light shoe for running errands.  Great with a sporty dress or yoga outfits."
New_Balance,4,Gift
New_Balance,4,Glad I got these shoes! I was looking for a black sneaker not made entirely of leather and these work great. I stand anywhere from 7-10 hours a day and these have helped a lot.
New_Balance,4,Good  arch support.
New_Balance,4,"Good basic shoe, maybe not the best for running or hiking. I got to wear at work (clinical lab, on my feet all day) and they were great today all day, even walking on my lunch break. So far so good."
New_Balance,4,Good for the money.  New Balance shoes just aren't as good as they used to be
New_Balance,4,Good looking sneakers and lightweight. Would be 5 stars but the back part of the sneaker rubs a little on the Achilles.
New_Balance,4,Good overall I just wish they had a little better traction. I've slipped a couple times when the ground is wet!
New_Balance,4,Good quality
New_Balance,4,Good shoe but they fit small! I am usually a size 7 but this size 7 fit snug. New Balance sneakers may just run small. Otherwise a good shoe.
New_Balance,4,Good shoe for the price but it does run about a half size small.
New_Balance,4,Good shoe. I simply ordered the wrong size.
New_Balance,4,"Great comfy shoes. I would recommend getting a half size bigger. Mine seem to be unraveling, look at pic."
New_Balance,4,"Great fit, super comfy... but NOT BLACK."
New_Balance,4,Great for daughter in gym
New_Balance,4,Great for Zumba/dance fitness!! A little tight in the toes. Love these shoes!! Highly recommend!!
New_Balance,4,"Great light weight  sneaker. I wear these for my walks (daily)  I have a  former broken foot  so I was a bit concerned with the comfort, and fit .  But all is great .  Pleased with this purchase ."
New_Balance,4,Great lightweight comfortable shoe!
New_Balance,4,Great lightweight comfortable shoes! I had to size up 1.5 sizes. I normally wear an 8 but got a 9.5. I also should have gotten a wide because the shoe itself is already very narrow. Overall love them!
New_Balance,4,"Great looking, super light and supportive just runs small order a half size up."
New_Balance,4,Great shoe! Little narrow for extra wide. Still very comfortable
New_Balance,4,"Great shoe, but order a half size up."
New_Balance,4,"Great shoes just not a true black color, they come off a little more on the gray side, but definitely love them!"
New_Balance,4,"Great shoes, bought them for my mom for walking and she loves them."
New_Balance,4,"Great shoes, lightweight. Easy to slide on and go. Not a lot of great support for myself personally."
New_Balance,4,"Great style, was a little tight in the toe box. I’ve gotten a shin splint since wearing them at work, so I’ve been switching shoes back and forth."
New_Balance,4,"Great support and perfect for walking around or exercise, my knees felt better the first step I took in them"
New_Balance,4,Great support and very light.
New_Balance,4,"Great support for walking, would not recommend for running more than 2 miles. Fit is larger than expected especially around top of ankle."
New_Balance,4,Great sure super comfy!! Sized up a half size after reading the reviews and it was good that I did as they run a bit small.
New_Balance,4,"Great, lightweight shoe! Only problem is the sole thins down quickly if you stay on your feet a lot."
New_Balance,4,Had to exchange for an 8 when I usually wear a 7.5. These run small.
New_Balance,4,"Hard to get on, probably because they are new. Fits well."
New_Balance,4,"High comfort level.
Low support level."
New_Balance,4,"I adore these shoes. I bought them for travel, I wanted a shoe that would get me through a long travel day, comfortably. These do just that. Would I run a marathon in them? No. But, they are VERY cozy for casual use. The foam sole is great and cushions my foot nicely. They are super light weight which made them both more comfortable and easily packed up. Plus, they look great. I will for sure be buying more colors."
New_Balance,4,I agree with some of the other comments that these are good shoes but definitely not something you could wear on an eight hour work shift regularly. I will keep these but need some thing with a little more support. These will be my walking shoes when I take the dog out.
New_Balance,4,"I always wear a 9.5 in New Balance. Ordered the same in these and they def run small- feel more like an 8.5-9.
Bummer because I trust New Balance so much and have been wearing them for years in the same size. Would return for a size up but already took the tags off (thinking they would of course fit like all my other New Balances)."
New_Balance,4,I am a 9.5 sometimes 9. I think the 9.5 of these might be a tiny bit small on me but I am keeping them. They are springy and give me energy
New_Balance,4,"I am a fan of New Balance, and this is the second pair of FuelCore shoes I've purchased. I will admit, I don't like the second as good as the first. The toe box is slightly narrower. I do a lot of plyometric work, and this made a big difference in how my foot feels in the shoe. I do like the material better, it's more a sock-like fit and the arch support is great! They feel slightly smaller overall, but the fit is still pretty good. I may go up a half size for the next pair, just for a little more wiggle room."
New_Balance,4,"I am a true to size 7.5 wide width. These were too short. Wanted to get a size larger but they were not available in my size and the color I wanted. Very disappointed!!  New Balance needs to size their shoes according to American sizing not Vietnamese, where they are manufactured!!"
New_Balance,4,"I am an 8.5 to 9 but usually tend to be on the smaller side and the reviews said to order half a size up, so I got a 9. My toes were right up against the front of the shoe. So if you are between sizes order half a size up from the bigger end. Returning to get a 9.5. I like the look though!"
New_Balance,4,I am normally always 5.5 or even a 6. I got these in a 5.5 and the were just a tad too small... I tried them on without socks and they were tight. I would even go a full size up if you want to skip arch inserts. I love the light weight feel and how breathable they are but I will be returning them for a 6 and also getting other colors too!!
New_Balance,4,"I am normally at true 7, but with this shoe the 7 was way to small ( the reason for the 4 stars)  Otherwise I loved the shoe. I will be returning  but only to reorder a size up."
New_Balance,4,"I am pleased with these sneakers as they provide the comfort and movement I need at a reasonable price point.
So glad I did not purchase the $120 pair."
New_Balance,4,"I am returning the first two pairs of shoes that I purchased due to a sizing issue. These run smaller in size than most shoes that I get, so a “word to the wise”, would be to get a whole size larger than you normally would! Overall feel looks great though, and they are light as a feather. 👍"
New_Balance,4,I am using these sneakers for exercising and they will work perfectly. Very light. True to size. I ordered an 8.5 wide.
New_Balance,4,"I bought these after trying on on a store and having my feet measured with a fancy machine. I’m a true 10, high arches with thin narrow feet. These shoes work as lifestyle shoes, walking around casually. I would never recommend these for any type of fitness activity. I weightlift and do HIIT 4 days a week and I would break my ankle in a second if I wore these in the gym. The sole is too squishy for stability when lifting, and the ankle collar is very low and wide so unless you have ankles of steel- save these for the grocery store. Otherwise pretty comfy."
New_Balance,4,"I bought these because they seem fairly popular in the healthcare community. I’m not one for Dansko’s/clogs of any kind due to the nature that they seem to set you up for ankle injuries. Definitely not a concern you should have to deal with. These NB’s don’t give very much in the department of ankle support but I do find them much easier to move around in. They’re very comfortable. However, size up a minimum of a half size. I purchased my normal size and my toes fully filled the toe box. Once you have your appropriate size, nothing but clouds to look forward to."
New_Balance,4,"I bought these exact shoes from
Nordstrom’s rack! I loved them! So when I saw them on amazon I ordered another pair!! Sadly they aren’t the same fit! I ordered a 6.5 just like the pair I got from Nordstrom’s rack. The ones I got from amazon say they are a 6.5 but they are defiantly smaller! I can’t wear them comfortably. I decided to wear them a bit in hopes that they would loosen up but they haven’t."
New_Balance,4,"I bought these shoes, excited because I am very picky when it comes to tennis shoes since I am on my feet all day as  a nurse. I ordered a size up and they fit perfect, they are very comfortable, and I love that they are breathable! Overall a great shoe! However, after owning them for about a week, I noticed a ""clicking"" sound when I walked. One of my shoes clicked and I could feel it in the sole when I took a step. I checked the bottom and there were no rocks, no gum, nothing, so I'm guessing it is something with the shoe. I really like them, but the continuous ""clicking"" has prevented me from wearing them anymore. Super bummed..."
New_Balance,4,I bought this for my mom and she usually wears a 7 1/2 but has to buy a size 8 because not a lot of brands have 1/2 sizes. After reading the reviews I decided to get her an 8 anyways since it supposedly ran small. Even an 8 seems to be a little tight. I'm not going to return since she said she can probably stretch it out with wear but it will be uncomfortable and tight for a least the first couple uses. She did say the sole was comfortable and supportive. Would recommend but this brand should make their shoes more true to size.
New_Balance,4,"I bought this shoe for casual walking. It doesn't really have arch support, and if I do a lot of walking my arches start to hurt. Still, it was priced well and I really like the color and it is cute enough to wear with jeans."
New_Balance,4,"I bought this shoes for Fridays at work. They look nice and are comfortable. Is like walking on socks at work. It would have been perfect if they would have been a little more smaller. But they don’t get out of my feet. I usually are a 8, but I would have bought these 7.5 instead."
New_Balance,4,"I can double knot my laces and they will still come undone. I’m always retying my shoes, and it’s annoying."
New_Balance,4,I didn’t like the gold accents on the back. They fit too small. I wear a 10.5 but ordered an 11. They fit like a 10.
New_Balance,4,"I do like this shoe a lot.  I can wear it most of the day before my ""bunion"" foot starts to ache.  My bunion is a little worse than average and I can still wear it so that's a big plus.  I usually wear a sz 9.5 in my walking shoes and that's what I got and it works.  It's a very comfortable shoe.  I highly recommend it."
New_Balance,4,"I don’t like the band inside, makes it difficult to put on. If you have a narrower foot it wouldn’t be an issue."
New_Balance,4,"I eear an 8, these fit smaller than all of my other shoes, including ones in this brand.  That was the only draw back.  I returned them and that was fast and easy."
New_Balance,4,I enjoy the overall fit of the shoe. It is a little tighter than i was expecting but my walls do not hurt my feet like my old shoes.
New_Balance,4,"I first purchased my normal size which is a 6 in medium width. I had to return for a 7 wide. Shoe are small and narrow, but one i got the bigger size they are really comfortable."
New_Balance,4,I generally wear an 8 but ordered a 9. I have wider feet at the top and they aren't to tight. They do run small the 9 fits right. The memory insoles they came with are not comfortable at all. I ordered memory insoles with the shoes and replacing them with different ones was way better. Overall they are good shoes didn't make my feet hurt after a 12 hour shift fit nicely and don't slide off feet. Only complaint is the insoles and small sizing. For sure order up and get some inserts!
New_Balance,4,"I give it a four star because they jacked the price up over twenty dollars from a week ago. I also gave it a four star because they do fit at the toe on the tighter side. Overall, they’re super comfy and WAS affordable. I won’t purchase another pair at $70 you can get nicer name brand for that price."
New_Balance,4,"I got an 8.5, which is my size, but it was really too small should have gotten a 9. Besides that, the shoe is beautiful, very light and I am happy with them. Hopefully, they will stretch out."
New_Balance,4,"I got these after getting the fresh foam New Balance sneakers and really liking them. The insole of these shoes is made of foam and is incredibly squishy. They're super comfortable but I'm getting the sense that the insole is starting to bunch some, so not sure how long they're going to last. These shoes are super low profile, so you'll need to wear no show socks with them."
New_Balance,4,"I got these for Disneyland and was a bit worried, everyone says to wear shoes in first before walking extensively in them. But, they were great. Comfiest shoes I've ever had. My feet would have hurt a lot more had I work basic walking shoes. I like that I don't have to tie and untie them everytime, as they slip on pretty easily. They only small gripe is that they let water in a bit easily."
New_Balance,4,"I had high hope for this shoe because it was so cute. I was looking for a stylish and casual shoe (just for fun not for working out). I wear a women's 12B however this shoe ran about a size too small. My toes came all the way up to the top of the shoe and the fit seemed a bit narrow.  Sadly, I sent them back; they don't come in a larger size. Cute shoe just size up one size if you can."
New_Balance,4,"I had to exchange and get half size larger then expected as my usual size was snug, love the pair that fits!"
New_Balance,4,"I have a older pair of NB shoes that I love and wear daily.  I wanted to upgrade and thought these were perfect.  Super cute and comfy, but they run a 1/2 size small.  I normally wear a 7.5 in NB, but these fit like a 7.  Gave them to my daughter who is in college and cheerleading and she loves them. Size up and you'll love them!"
New_Balance,4,"I have always worn a 7 1/2 in New Balance shoes but it was too small and my toes felt crowded.  Returned and ordered a size 8, and they are fine.  So, if you are considering these, order a half-size up.  Very lightweight and comfortable once I got the size 8."
New_Balance,4,"I have another pair of NB shoes that I really like, so ordered these thinking they'd be similar.  I'm an 8 in the other pair so ordered an 8 in these.  I could've sized up to an 8.5 for a better fit, but for what I'm using these for, I think they'll be okay.  The sole is somewhat hard and not as squishy/bouncy as my other NB shoes.  They look very nice on.  They somewhat dip low, so no-show socks are a must with these - definitely more a spring/summer shoe than a fall/winter."
New_Balance,4,"I have been on the search for the perfect shoe for years.  New shoes never work very long for me. There is always some sort of problem that occurs and I have to move on to a new shoe.  Unfortunately, these were no different for me.  The fit is very good and they're comfortable when I first got them. Now I've had them for a few weeks and I'm already having issues. (But keep in mind that just because I have issues with them doesn't mean you will.)

Altogether, these are good shoes. New balance is a good brand and maybe a different type of their shoe will work for me.  These, however, are already giving me a blister under my ankle bone.  I've had to apply a band-aid under my sock because I've bled while at work.  I was not expecting that from these but I ended up with a nice little scab that I didn't even realize was forming.

I haven't worn these in rainy weather so I don't know how they work there.

My biggest issue with these that I think may affect others.... they don't stay tied. This is as easy as getting different shoelaces, which I would do if I were going to continue using these, but I don't plan to use these longer than another week.  I double-knot them and they still come undone in a matter of minutes. I've never had shoes do this before and am not sure why these laces do it, but they do."
New_Balance,4,I have big feet and I LOVE these shoes because they make my feet look shorter. I highly recommend for looks. Not support.
New_Balance,4,I have bought two pairs of these and love them. I wear them to the gym. They’re light and breathable. I’ll be purchasing probably a third pair soon again.
New_Balance,4,"I have low arches and tend to pronate, these shoes exasperated this problem, I could tell as soon as I put them on. I had to send them back. Sad though, price was decent and they were comfortable and cute."
New_Balance,4,I have narrow feet but the insoles feel so strange sometimes as if they’re cutting into my soles. The shoe width is fine but the insoles I believe are too narrow for the shoe.
New_Balance,4,"I have not worn a lot, but so far I like these for doing indoor walking and HIIT, I was looking for support for doing a variety of movements and I think these will work. I love how light weight they are and the support in the soles are great. They are a little tight so I do have to wear my thin socks. Might want a half size up. But not sure if that would be right. If I order more will do that. I suggest I you can get true size and half up then return one."
New_Balance,4,"I have only worn these a couple of times.  I got them to start doing some walking for exercise.  I am not an athlete, and do not work out, so not sure how they would be for that.  They are lightweight and very comfortable.  However, because of that, they do not provide much support.  After wearing them out yesterday for several hours, while they did not hurt my feet, because I have a very low arch, I feel I need some arch support in them.  A great walking around shoe, from what I can tell so far."
New_Balance,4,I have some issues with my feet due to arthritis and these shoes don't sit on top of my toes. It's very difficult to find shoes that doesn't cause me pain.
New_Balance,4,I have the gray & black pair. Comfortable & fit well.
New_Balance,4,I have these same shoes in a different style and love them (I’m a surgical nurse and do lots of walking) so I decided to get another pair. These came in but were significantly smaller compared to my other pair for some reason. Size 1/2 size up!
New_Balance,4,"I have this shoe in 3 colors. First pair I bought at an “off-price” department store and the next two pair from here. I love them so much!  Super lightweight and comfortable all day long. I wore them at Disney. I will say that I have a narrow foot and bought the regular width and it seems like I would have bought the narrow option, but it’s not tight at all. It's just more of a narrow shoe to begin with, in my opinion. I cannot wear regular socks with them, therefore the sole tends to hunch up in the middle when I take them off my feet. I think if I wore the no-show socks it would most likely not come loose. I plan on buying more in the future, though."
New_Balance,4,I have to return these for a larger size but that was easy.  Very good quality and easy exchange
New_Balance,4,I have wide feet and when I first tried on I could not tell they were wide width. Not so tight that they are worth returning though. Maybe my toes will hate me later
New_Balance,4,"I haven’t worn these for an extended period of time yet. The only negative at this point is getting them on. Because it is not a true lace up shoe, and I have rather a high arch, any kind of sock is too thick so it pulls and makes your toes curl. Once I figured out that you have to leave a little bit of sock at the toe, it doesn’t feel so bad, but it is really annoying."
New_Balance,4,I haven't had these for long but so far I love them. They are very comfortable and I've have no problems with them. I will say they do run small. I read the reviews so I knew to buy a size up and I'm glad I did. Planning to wear them in Disney next week!
New_Balance,4,I initially bought these based off the way they looked and because I had a credit. They are actually really comfortable and true to size. Great value for the price.
New_Balance,4,I just bought these for walking around casually but if I bought them for running I would size up a half size.
New_Balance,4,"I just got these shoes today and they or super comfortable, but WAY too small. I ordered my usual size of 7, but they fit like a 6. I just ordered another pair in an 8. I’ll update once I get them."
New_Balance,4,"I like everything about these sneakers. Light weight, color and very comfortable. The only little thing about them is that the laces untie so easy, just need to do double knot :)"
New_Balance,4,I like that I got home from working and my feet didn't feel exhausted. Definitely don't but these if you work in a kitchen. I kept sliding all over the place lol. Definitely a slip hazard.
New_Balance,4,"I like that these shoes are very light, and breathable! Only downside I would say is they dont seem to have a lot of support, but if you’re looking for a comfy casual shoe these are nice. I would definitely say to size up at least a half size, maybe even a full size as they do run small. But overall I’m impressed for the low price!"
New_Balance,4,I like that they are super comfortable but I feel like they didn't last long. I'm on my feet all night at work and the comfort in them seemed to have wore out a few months after wearing them.
New_Balance,4,"I like the feel and comfort of this shoe.  They are easy to get on and off.  With bad knees it can be difficult to  wedge your foot into a stiff shoe.  I recieved 2 pair as gifts over the past 8 months or so.  As a result I purchased 2 additional pair when they were discounted a few days.  Although they are comfortable I foresee needing to use gel heel insoles if I plan on walking ALL day.  I think my knees would do better.  One thing I noticed in sizing.  I found the 2 pair with the mesh like material on the forefoot were great in a 8.5 Wide.  However, the grey had to be returned for a size 9.  They felt ok smaller, but the right shoe inside seams felt problematic.  The size 9 overal looked & felt better.  I plan on one more pair maybe two if the white ones come down in price."
New_Balance,4,"I like the look of the shoe and the all day comfort. I dislike the difficulty in putting the shoe on. With a high arch, it can be a struggle to pull the shoe on ."
New_Balance,4,"I like the look with skinny jeans or yoga pants. They also look good with jogger scrub pants, but not really with wide legged ones. They are great for a lot of easy walking but they do hurt my toes."
New_Balance,4,I like the most that it has a cussion on the bottom.
New_Balance,4,"I like the overall sneaker, but the size is a little off. I wear a size 11 and ordered a 11 and my toes are slightly crunched up. I can bare it as long as I’m not wearing them for a long period of time. I say 5 hours maximum and it’s a wrap."
New_Balance,4,"I like the shoe but it is a struggle to get it on. Use a shoehorn. The tongue is not free so it is a slip on with laces. Once the shoe is on, it's pretty comfortable. The wide width was perfect.  Not difficult to remove.  Looks good on."
New_Balance,4,I like the shoe but order up a 1/2 size for sure
New_Balance,4,"I like the shoe, but while other NB products have fit perfectly if roomy in the past these are sadly on the small side especially in the toe and are uncomfortable for long periods of them.  I love the fabric and the way the shoes lace - makes them easy to slip on an lid off."
New_Balance,4,"I like the sneakers. I read the reviews and decided to size up a half size. I normally use 8 1/2 , but the 9 that I ordered fit very well (I only wear them while wearing socks). I'm not wild about the color, a little to ""pink"" for me, but I'm keeping them."
New_Balance,4,I like the style and color. The shoe was too tight around the big toe area. I was concerned that my toes would push a hole through the shoe.....this has happened before with other shoes.
New_Balance,4,"I like the style, fits good."
New_Balance,4,I like the way these shoes look. I don’t feel like they have quite enough support on the inside edge of my foot. I do like the overall though.
New_Balance,4,"I like them for leg days. They can just skip on and are loose around the ankle, which I like having for the extra range of motion."
New_Balance,4,"I like them, I will continue to wear them as I only purchased them for when I am on my elliptical.  I love the color and they do the job as my running shoes were not adequate for the job when on the elliptical.  Just wish I had possibly gone up a half size.  They fit but if I were running in them my toes could possibly rub."
New_Balance,4,"I like these shoes, however after reading reviews for 30 mins I decided to go up half a size. Normally 8, but I got an 8.5. They fit me great. Not a ton of support. I walk 1.5 miles a day on my lunch break. They work for me."
New_Balance,4,I like your style and they're comfortable but not for long walks. Walking around the house was okay but the moment I stepped onto cement on the street and walked about 3 miles I could feel every Nuance of the ground that was walking on
New_Balance,4,I liked that this shoe was light weight and  fairly comfortable but I could not properly evaluate it since I ordered my regular size and it was too small. I would have to order a whole size larger for this to fit.
New_Balance,4,"I liked the color and the style.  No tongues and no laces to tie.  They were a bit big in the toe box but I'm not complaining.  That is rare in shoes for my wide feet.  They are also very comfy.  Not as much support as I would have liked, but they are a great addition to my NB collection.  I would not walk long distance in them due to the support."
New_Balance,4,"I liked the shoe very much, but it runs small."
New_Balance,4,I liked the shoes but I wish I had gone a half size up. Please go a half size up. The shoe is super cute and very comfortable. I wore them for my 8 hour shift as a nurse.
New_Balance,4,"I love all black sneakers.  My usual all black sneakers were super comfy but the tread had worn down substantially so I was looking for a replacement.  I saw these, read the reviews and decided to give them a shot.  Put them on as soon as they arrived and kept them on all day.  They felt magnificent!  The reviews are correct in that they are a little snug.  I usually wear an 8 in sneakers and I ordered an 8 in this case as well.  I actually like the snug feel as it fits like a literal glove!  If you prefer more room or if you plan to wear thicker socks I would suggest ordering a half size up!  I thought about ordering a half size up, trying it on and returning which ever pair doesn’t fit the best, but the price increased (mine was $30 and now it’s $70).  I am happy with these, I wear them with thin no-show socks.  They literally fit like a glove and they have moderate arch support.  The insoles feel very comfy.  If possible I would suggest trying these on in-store somewhere.  Great shoe overall!"
New_Balance,4,"I love everything about these sneakers from the look to the feel. However I did take a star off as the pull tab on the heel ripped off after the second use. For the price, I'd expect these to be stronger."
New_Balance,4,I love how light weight these are and especially the Minnie Mouse. I ordered a half size larger than usual which I'm glad I did. Great little shoe
New_Balance,4,I love how lightweight these are but I bought my usual size 10 and they were a bit small and they hurt the top of my foot where the tongue of the shoe is. I would buy again just a bigger size.
New_Balance,4,"I love how these look— they grip and stick to the floor, but I think that might wear off. I ordered my normal size (7) and they were way too small. I’m returning them to try a 7.5 and am hoping for better results!"
New_Balance,4,"I love New Balace shoes, but these definately ran small.

As expected, these shoes are very well made."
New_Balance,4,I love that I can easily slip on these shoes and they still fit perfectly.
New_Balance,4,I love the feel of the shoe and how light they are but they run small. I normally wear a 7 and ordered an 8.5 like I normally do for running/workout shoes and they fit like a 7. Barely any room above my toe. I’m going to reorder again in a bigger size because I do really like the shoe.
New_Balance,4,"I love the look and feel, but they run quite small compared to other athletic shoes. I reordered in a bigger size."
New_Balance,4,"I love the shoe, it was too small for my toes though. So I exchanged them for a wide."
New_Balance,4,"I love the way these shoes look. But they really don't have much support. I work in the medical field and I can not wear them all day walking around the hospital. They are really just one of those shoes you wear for a cute shoe, not for support! I get lots of compliments every time I wear them. But I will def say order a half size up!! Thank goodness for free Prime returns because I had to return the first pair. I usually wear a sz 9 in tennis shoes (8.5 in sandals). I had to get a 9.5 in these."
New_Balance,4,I love the way they fit. Really comfortable..
New_Balance,4,I love them! They’re so comfortable just make sure you order half a size up
New_Balance,4,"I love these shoes as a cute assessory to a casual outfit - with jeans and a sweatshirt.  The gold stripe jazzes up any outfit and I’ve received a lot of compliments on them.

But if you are looking for a running/exercise sneaker, these are by NO MEANS A FUNCTIONAL SHOE. They have little to no support and in fact supinate (rolling to the outside) your foot.

So if you are looking for fun sneakers to add to your fashion collection absolutely consider these but if you are looking for a good running shoe, look elsewhere."
New_Balance,4,"I love these shoes as a walking shoe and maybe a light lifting workout. I bought these 1/2 a size bigger as suggested and they were initially ok, but are feeling a bit small. Buy one size bigger to your true size and should workout great."
New_Balance,4,"I love these shoes! My feet are very odd, and I'm on them for long shifts at work, and normal shoes do not stay comfortable for me for very long. These have been amazing! I give 4 stars because my biggest complaint is that the shoelaces do not stay tied! Double knot, triple knot, they eventually come undone and I'm walking around with a foot of shoelace whipping."
New_Balance,4,"I love these shoes! They are very true to size, extremely comfortable, and BREATHABLE.

The only slightly negative thing I have to say is that if you are looking for arch support this is not the shoe for you. I use these for casual wear and have a designated pair of workout shoes when the support is necessary."
New_Balance,4,"I love these shoes, they are comfy and lightweight. Only downside is I ordered the all black and got the grey and white. Still use them because it wasn't that big of an issue."
New_Balance,4,"I love these shoes. However, I wish I had sized up. They definitely run small. I usually wear a 9 but they were very tight. I had to return but ordered a 10. Can’t wait to get them in!"
New_Balance,4,I love these shoes....But I’m glad I ordered a half size up. I normally where a 6.5 but got a 7 and they fit like my other size 6.5 sneakers do.
New_Balance,4,I love these to just wear daily out and about. I would not consider then a walking or running shoe. The arch support is adequate but I could use a little more. I own other New Balance walking shoes that are  more support and better suited for walking/jogging.
New_Balance,4,I love these. I’m a big fan of NB shoes in general and wanted some slip-ons for a vacation I’m getting ready to take. I wish there were a tad more support like their other shoes but I still really like these and have enjoyed wearing them.
New_Balance,4,I love this shoe. The only downfall is the sole of the shoe slips out sometime. I also don’t wear socks with them so that probably doesn’t help with the sole of the shoe staying in place. Overall I love it and have already purchased another pair!
New_Balance,4,"I love to use these shoes as ""slip ons"" even though they are not really. They are so comfortable and I can walk quickly and comfortably. The only thing is that this is my second pair (and yes I plan I getting a third pair I love them so much) is that the top of the toe is not protected in anyway and so it wears through really quicky with the thin mesh. I wear white sox so they need to be replaced as soon as this happens or it looks bad."
New_Balance,4,"I loved everything about this shoe except the size. They definitely run small! I ordered my usual size (a 10)  and had to return it. I have the next size up coming and hope it fits better. Otherwise, I found it to be very comfortable and loved the style."
New_Balance,4,I loved the look and feel of these sneakers. But they didn’t have wider width so I had to return. I liked them so much I’m going to try 1/2 size larger.
New_Balance,4,I loved the support but the fit was very snug. I actually had to send them back because there’s no way they would last being that tight. I normally wear a 7 so that’s what I ordered but there was just no give to them at all.
New_Balance,4,I marked that the shoes were too large but that really wasn't the case.  For some reason the shoes made me feel like I was walking on the inside of my feet.  I wished they had worked.  They were lightweight and very comfortable (besides the slant of my feet).  I could slip them on and off without tying them.  I don't know if they would have made a good running shoe but they would work well as a workout shoe.  I did order a half size larger which was a good choice.  I also ordered a wide but I don't think I would have needed it.  The toebox was flexible enough that my toes never felt  squished.  There was decent arch support.
New_Balance,4,I must they're comfortable and fit true to size
New_Balance,4,I needed a pair of black sports she’s that I could wear to work and still look professional. These are perfect and they are really comfortable.
New_Balance,4,"I never thought I would need to size up to a 9 because I am always an 8, but had to exchange for a 9 as the 8 was FAR too small. They are lightweight and soft, but not a ton of arch or ankle support if you need it. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase for a reliable summer walking shoe."
New_Balance,4,I normally order size 8 in running shoes. These run bigger than my other running shoes...in length and width. They are comfy and cute though
New_Balance,4,"I normally wear a 7 1/2 to 8 tennis shoe. I ordered and had to send back two pairs before I found one that fit - in a size 9! I’ve never worn a size 9… Ever. That being said, these are comfortable and I will enjoy using them while working out. Colors are pretty. Runs really small!"
New_Balance,4,"I normally wear an 8 and the 9 fit perfectly, so I suggest getting a size bigger than what you usually wear. The sole wore out after wearing them about 10 times, and it has no ankle support, but the shoe is cute. I would definitely buy it again."
New_Balance,4,"I normally wear between a 6 and a 6.5 in shoes. The 6.5 is just a bit short, so I returned and ordered a 7. I'm hoping those will fit perfectly."
New_Balance,4,I often have to dress up at work but have plantar fascitis.  These shoes allow me to keep a professional look with comfort.  They are light weight and comfy.
New_Balance,4,I only buy New Balance sneakers. Always the same size. These run a little small. Otherwise the shoes are great.
New_Balance,4,I ordered a size 7 w and they were way to tight.  I returned them and ordered a size 8 w. The 8 fits perfectly. Buy a size up.
New_Balance,4,I ordered a wide and they are tight
New_Balance,4,"I ordered a wide shoe, and my feet feel a bit wider than the sole, but overall a great buy. Super comfortable."
New_Balance,4,"I ordered a women's 7 wide which normally fits very well and while the shoes do fit, it's just a bit snug. I should have ordered a 7.5, but I guess that's the problem with ordering shoes online, you never know quite how they will fit. I'm hoping they'll fit better after some breaking in (and paired with some thinner socks). Overall I'm quite happy."
New_Balance,4,"I ordered an 8 in the sea salt color.  I have worn various versions of this type of NB shoe.  I generally wear an 8 in most tennis/running shoes and these were no different for me.  They are incredibly comfortable for walking around all day.  I have worn them during mixed work-outs as well and they hold up - I wouldn't do any long distance running in them as they lack arch support for that.  I gave this version/color 4 stars because I thought the sea salt color would be closer to white and I really wanted a white shoe and liked the design on the heel.  However, when they arrived they are very yellow in most lights - light butter color.  Since the color seems so off from the description and picture I am returning."
New_Balance,4,"I ordered an 8.5, I’m between an 8 and 8.5, glad I sized up. Overall it’s a good shoe for light walking and going out. Not super supportive, wouldn’t recommend if you’re on your feet all day."
New_Balance,4,"I ordered my usual size in an athletic shoe but found the toe box short/low profile, so re-ordered the next larger size.  They are extremely lightweight.  I use an OTC orthotic in them for extra arch support."
New_Balance,4,I ordered the gray ones but received the navy blue ones. I didn't return them because I ended up loving the navy blue. I might end up ordering the gray ones again.
New_Balance,4,I ordered the wrong size and sent them back
New_Balance,4,"I ordered these based on another pair shoes I had just like them only in a different color it’s good to know that these are cotton on top they are not mesh, like my other ones, but I still plan to keep them for a good pair of summer running shoes. The best thing about these shoes as if you’ve ever had a heel injury or a heel cord injury, these shoes are very soft in that area and do not apply pressure to the back of the heel cord."
New_Balance,4,"I ordered these in wide to accommodate my high arch, but they are still tight over the top of my foot.  (They are not a “true” laced shoe—you can only loosen up to a point; there is still an elastic strap, which I had to cut!😅)
I like everything else about  them though, so if you don’t have a high arch, I’d recommend.  Good price, cute, comfy, and versatile."
New_Balance,4,"I ordered wide but they werent wide enough, easy return"
New_Balance,4,i prefer new balance over any other brand as they last longer and my feet dont hurt after being on them all day at work.
New_Balance,4,I purchased for working out and they do not have enough stability for the workouts I do...really nothing wrong with shoe...will be returning!  Thank you
New_Balance,4,"I purchased these a size big so my custom inserts would fit inside and they were signifficantly too big to use in these shoes.  I am a solid size 6 in tennis shoes, ordered a 7 and they barely fit barefoot muchless with socks or the inserts.  Otherwise, very nice quality but I would definitely size up."
New_Balance,4,I purchased these on a whim and I’m so glad I read the reviews beforehand. Definitely size 1/2 size up. I wear an 8 and purchased 8.5. They fit perfectly! They’re super cute and light weight. I’ll be purchasing another pair and color. I bought the gray/mint ones and they’re even better in person!
New_Balance,4,I read some reviews saying to go up half a size but I didn't listen because I've seen that on other pairs of shoes I've bought off Amazon before but never actually needed to. But on these I should have listened. Still going to keep them for trips to the grocery store or for other menial tasks. They're on sale for a good price and comfortable so I plan on ordering another pair in a larger size.
New_Balance,4,"I really like the look of these. I ordered the all black ones. I’m usually a size 6, but if I would’ve gone up half a size they would’ve fit perfectly. They were just a little too snug for me. I’m usually not a person that sizes up or needs a lot of extra space or wears thick socks. I needed to wear them right away so I couldn’t exchange them.  I might still order the 6 1/2. Other than that I really liked then. For me these were great for walking around."
New_Balance,4,"I really like the memory foam insole to these shoes. It's very comfortable. I will say that after a couple of weeks it has compressed quite a bit, however. I ordered 12 Wide sized shoes, and they fit a bit loosely, but then I did add my own orthopedic support to the shoes below the memory foam insole, which was easily removable, in order to support my metatarsalgia. This created a tighter fit and has resulted in a supremely comfortable, lightweight shoe. I walk about 3-4 miles a day, and they've held up pretty well. I love that they're basically slip-on shoes, but have laces to tighten the front as needed. I can't wear no-show socks with these shoes as the heel comes up and rubs on my achilles tendon, but a low-cut sock still works. I even got caught in a downpour and my shoes were soaked to the point of squelching. They dried out within hours, after I took out the insoles. My only real complaint is that they're not super breathable. When I come back from my walks, my feet are VERY hot. Still, I'm considering getting another pair. I definitely recommend this shoe."
New_Balance,4,I really like these shoes and with some breaking in they will be perfect.  I just wish I had ordered 1/2 size larger.
New_Balance,4,I really like these shoes. I bought a size 9 and my foot looks very small. They are so light and it’s exactly what I was looking for. I use them for both walking and indoor workouts. I haven’t tried them for running though.
New_Balance,4,I really like these shoes. They are very comfortable and I can walk in them for hours.
New_Balance,4,I really like this shoe; my only complaint is that the lower half is white and the first time I wore them my mom's golden stepped on my foot with muddy paws....that left stains :-(
New_Balance,4,"I really liked the look of these shoes, however I had to return them due to the fact that my orthotics pushed my arch too high up and therefore made the shoes too tight across the arch. Too bad for me. Super cute, low profile shoe, but no arch support in them at all."
New_Balance,4,"I really love the look of this shoe and it’s very comfortable. After reading reviews I decided to get an 8, but I think I would have been better with my usual 7.5, but the 8 is fine so I’m not going to bother with a return.
I wouldn’t recommend this show for walking and running, but it’s great for typical indoor workouts or weightlifting."
New_Balance,4,"I really love these shoes even though yes it's true there's no support and you can feel the ground too much. Easily remedied with a Dr. Scholls insert which will add an extra $15-20 to the cost of the shoe. That said, they are so cute and and are one of the few shoes that make my huge feet look small. I wear an 11 as a female. Once you get the right insert for your arch type, these are awesome. You can take the original insert out so it's not so tight with the new insert however I just put mine on top and west without socks and it's perfect."
New_Balance,4,"I really normally like new balance. I have 2 other pairs in size 8.5, so I ordered 8.5 in these, they were too small so had to get 9. They are very lightweight but not as much arch support. I guess for the price you can only expect so much"
New_Balance,4,"I really REALLY like these shoes. Over the past 6 months I have started walking and hiking 6-12 miles every day and these shoes are perfect for me. Now, I’ll be honest... there was a bit of a love/hate thing at first. It’s not so much that you need to break them in as it’s more like your feet need to get used to the shoes. Once that happened I was so happy with the comfort. I have zero arch pain which is a major selling point for me because that’s typically a big issue. I honestly want to order these in a few more colors."
New_Balance,4,I really think these are a reasonably priced shoes for a good quality. My only concern is that I ordered wide width and they fit a little snug.
New_Balance,4,"I received my pair of Black and Grey this afternoon. Upon first impression I really like the look of these. However, since I am an avid New Balance fan, I’m used to ordering up a half size. After first reading reviews to double check, I went ahead and ordered up. This is my first pair of casual New Balance, all my other shoes from them are for serious running. So maybe the sizing is different? Because, Even with socks, I have more room in these than with any of my other New Balance shoes, but they are comfortable. The socks I’m wearing in the photo are a bit on the thick side though. I cant imagine wearing them these with thin socks, which is what I’d wanted to do, they would be too big. Without socks, they feel totally unwearable. My foot slides back and forth and I have way too much room. I could easily have ordered my standard size. I also have annoying dents in the toes of both shoes. I had such high hopes for these. I will be returning these for a different pair."
New_Balance,4,"I returned because it was to small, didn’t have the arch support I was looking for, and I felt the back was to low. They were cute shoes and had the potential to be very comfortable if they had been the right size"
New_Balance,4,I should had exchanged I just didn’t want to mess with it
New_Balance,4,"I sized up a half size because of the other reviews. I’m usually a 7 but I got a 7.5. The toe box is roomier than I’d like, but the width is really snug so if I think if I would have gotten a 7 it would have been overall too snug to be comfortable with socks on. The soles are very comfy and I’d say these shoes are overall definitely worth the price. They’re cute and look nice with scrubs."
New_Balance,4,I think it's a Good shoe!! I was recommended New Balance due to my recent diagnosis of plantar fasciitis.  I think the arch support helps reduce the pain in my heel.
New_Balance,4,I thought it would be a little more comfy but it’s great to run my errands in/walk my doggos. They’ve lasted awhile now
New_Balance,4,"I traditionally purchase sneakers one size bigger than my normal to allow for sock room, etc.
These run small for sure! I wear a 10 normal so ordered an 11, fit like a 10.5 at best. I returned because a 12 would be way to big.
I also have slightly narrow feet. In order to tighten these to where i didn't feel like my toes were pressing forward and my heel wasn't coming out- it looked really silly and too wide.
I love the look just not the right shoe for me."
New_Balance,4,I use them as casual walking shoes. They are perfect  for that.
New_Balance,4,"I use these only in the gym. I would not walk long distances in them. But they are nice and light, give great support and are very comfortable."
New_Balance,4,I used these for a dance aerobics class and they fit perfectly with thin socks. I ordered half a size up and still with regular socks they would be small. They are very lightweight and look good. Not a lot of support but good for this purpose.
New_Balance,4,"I used to work at a shoe store so poo on me for forgetting New Balance is notorious for running small. I typically wear a 7.5. my first pair was too small so I gave them to my daughter. My replacement pair came yesterday, a size 8. They still barely  fit but they also need worn in. an 8.5 would have fit perfectly. If you order, make sure you order a size or two up."
New_Balance,4,"I usually am the same size in all new balance shoes. But this fit a little snuggly. Not so snug that I wanted to try going up from an 11 to a 12, but I just hope the hold up well. They are comfortable though and very light weight."
New_Balance,4,"I usually wear a 11 in this brand, I got a 12 for good measure and it fits like an 11 would. I would suggest to go a size bigger on these.
Comfort is ok. I haven't worn them long enough, yet, to break them in but they aren't the worst things I've had on my feet so I can't complain, yet.
There's little arch support, so if you're looking for that, you won't find it in these but the heels and ball are supported.
I use these for every day so I don't know how they are for working out. They are easy to slide on and off, though and that's what I was looking for.
All in all, I give them a 6 out of 10"
New_Balance,4,"I usually wear a 9.5 wide in Sketchers, these were too short. My toes were all the way at the end. I gave them to my daughter and ordered a 10 wide. Still tighter than my Sketchers, but ok. Not super padded insole, but comfy enough. Nice and grippy soles."
New_Balance,4,"I usually wear a 9.5-10. Beard of reviewers, I ordered a 10 which was still to small. I would have exchanged if my size/color was available however it was not."
New_Balance,4,"I usually wear a size 10 and after reading that reviews, was a little nervous that a 10 wouldn't fit. I went with a 10 wide and they fit perfect! I got the all black pair mostly for day to day wear - I am not sure they will be great to work out in but, I am pleased with them for what I bought them for!"
New_Balance,4,I usually wear a size 12 when I got this I tried it on and noticed my toe kind of reaches the top but it's not tight around my foot so that's good overall I love it fits perfect. Although I would recommend to go 1 size up from your original size if it's too loose from going up a size you can always grow into it
New_Balance,4,I usually wear an 11 in tennis shoes and that's what I ordered but they were too tight on my toes and too small overall
New_Balance,4,I walk a lot and these are really comfortable. They provide good support and great cushioning. Lightweight and excellent as an every day walking shoe
New_Balance,4,I wanted to love these shoes. The right one fit better than the left. They are nice and light weight but there could be better arch support. My left foot would roll inwards with every step. Had to return.
New_Balance,4,"I was looking for a cute and comfortable pair of sneakers to wear at work since we’ve been dressing more comfortably once we’ve re-opened after quarantine. New balance is usually a good brand for me. I have flat feet, so my ankles overpronate, and my feet are just slightly wider than average because of bunionettes. These shoes in the pink Heather are so cute—great casual look. They are mostly comfortable and super light weight. They have little to no arch support though and I can see and feel my ankles kind of rolling inward as I walk in them. This hasn’t led to any pain or discomfort, but I may consider arch supporting inserts one day."
New_Balance,4,"I was shopping for an all black pair of shoes. These ones caught my eye, they looks nice and sleek not bulky. All black. Breathable. Cute. So I went for them, although I wanted lace free slip-ons. These are still slip-ons but with laces. But what I do is tie the laces very well to a perfect fit and use them as slip-ons. So it’s fine. My only nit picky issue is that they are not as comfortable as I wished. They fine like I can spend a day in them no issue while wearing them. But my feet then feel the impact later on after a long day of running around doing errands and what not. My older adidas never did that. They were super comfortable and my feet felt fine after a long day. But this is not big of an issue for me to return them. I got used to it."
New_Balance,4,I was told to size up and I’m glad I did. I purchased these for work and it’s only been 2 weeks but so far so good. I’m an RN Inma busy ER.
New_Balance,4,I was very impressed with these. I actually ordered another pair.
New_Balance,4,"I wear a 6.5 in women’s and that’s usually just a tad big. Based on reviews and trying a different color on at the store, I went with a 7 and my toes are to the top, but not too tight and not painful. Other than that the shoes are super comfy and I love that they are low cut and slip on."
New_Balance,4,I wear a 7 and because of the reviews I purchased 7.5.  Could have even gone up a full size.
New_Balance,4,"I wear a 7 and it was ever so slightly too small. It fits snug in the toe and I kept them because I am still able to work out but if I order these again (and I probably will), I'll get a 7.5. Overall a great shoe at a great price for running on treadmill and moderate weights / workout routines."
New_Balance,4,I wear a 8.5 in everything and they were a half size too small...Consider ordering a half size larger.
New_Balance,4,I wear a 9 medium and ordered that exact size in mid January. I found that it runs small so I choose to exchange them for a 9.5 but there was a delay in shipping time and they wouldn't arrive until March. So I had to cancel the order..
New_Balance,4,"I wear an 8.5 in every shoe brand, even NB, but in this particular style, the 8.5 was too small and I needed a 9."
New_Balance,4,"I wear size 8.5 narrow in shoes (Nike).  These shoes  run small and are little snug for me, as I work 12 hours shift in a clinic. I would recommend to go 1/2 size bigger. Otherwise these are great budget shoes, comfortable and light weight."
New_Balance,4,I wear these when i go out walking with my dog. I've been wearing them to walk in everyday for about 6 months and they're still in decent condition. Some small holes have started at the top. They feel comfortable walking in for long periods of time/long distances.
New_Balance,4,"I went up half a size and they fit great, my normal size might have fit as well but it would have probably been snug. the part where the shoes laces kind of being just for looks kind of threw me off initially but I have gotten used to it and I love them. Great shoes and I have hiked in them, gone running, done a lot of walking/standing and so far they are great for me, I have high arches too. I am not sure how long they will last but I have had them a few months now and they are good enough. Might try to look for some different ones for running but so far these are working for me as well."
New_Balance,4,I will love these shoes. I would 1/2 size up. My last Nb were 8 so I got an 8 again and they are a bit snug. I’m still going to keep them and hope they stretch out a little. So nice fro the price though! Very light weight
New_Balance,4,"I wore these two days in a row power walking on some semi rough torrain, 2 miles. my arches which never hurt before were hurting.  These are for casual walkers. Wearing to the airport now, getting them on and off through security was extremely difficult"
New_Balance,4,"I work in health care so I'm on my feet non-stop. These shoes are a lifesaver!! Fit great, super light weight, and breathable so my feet stay cool. Much better than a pair of pumas i bought at twice the price."
New_Balance,4,"I work in retail so I bought these shoes. I'm normally a 7.5 in size, my toes are right at the front, a half size up would be good if you don't want your toes hitting the top when you walk. Apart from that they are super comfy and they have helped eliminate a lot of aching in my feet, legs and back."
New_Balance,4,I would get these in a half size up. Returned the ones I received because they were too small even though they were my usual size.
New_Balance,4,I would have given this shoe a five star rating if I took the advice of the amazon reviewers to order a half size up. I was worried to order a size 9 because I didn't want my feet to look huge but the style of the shoe makes my feet look smaller than the actual real size!  So I am please with the style and the look of the shoe but they are a little snug at the toes. I would order these shoes again and order a size up.
New_Balance,4,"I would’ve given these shoes 5 stars,but they run small. Because I ordered a bigger size (going accordingly to reviews)..the 9 1/2 wide fit like the standard size 9. Which is perfect for me,but again remember I am a size 9. With that being said they are comfortable and I can stand/walk for a good 8-10 hours daily without any pain. One other small thing is.. I feel like these shoes definitely focus on arch support. Whereas I would’ve preferred an even distribution of support from toe to heel. Definitely worth the purchase"
New_Balance,4,I’d order a half size larger than your actual size. They run small.
New_Balance,4,"I’m a 26 y.o. female who has worn the same size shoe for 14 years. While these shoes are very comfortable, supportive, and sleek looking they run small in the toe box. I had to exchange from a 6 to a 6.5; for reference, I wear size 6 in ever shoe I own."
New_Balance,4,"i’m a little frustrated with the seller of these shoes. i’m normally a size 7 so at first I got the 7 for $64, and they were too small so I sent back immediately. So I went ahead and ordered the 7 1/2 because I needed them right away for my new job and they were $86 ?!? very confused as to why I had to pay $24 extra dollars for the half size up. I got them anyway because of the good reviews but after wearing them for a while they aren’t as comfy as i’d hoped. very disappointed for the price I paid."
New_Balance,4,I’m a nurse and they were very comfortable and lasted a 12 shift on my feet without my feet swelling or hurting.
New_Balance,4,I’m a size 7.5-8. The first time I purchase the sneakers I got a size 8.5 and it was too tight at the top. So I decided to go up to a size 9.5 and it fits perfectly.
New_Balance,4,I’m a true size 10 and had to order up a half size. I have a narrow/regular foot and this shoe is close to being tight on me. With that being said order a half size up solved those problems and these shoes are super cute and at a great price point!
New_Balance,4,I’m normally an 8. I should’ve gotten an 8.5 in these 😑
New_Balance,4,"I’m not a fan of memory foam, but these are very comfortable shoes.  If you buy your size, you will need to wear thin socks.  If you are a thick sock person, get a half size up.  I walk/run 3.1 miles at least 3+ times a week outside.  These shoes are not made for that!  I will use these shoes for days I dress casual at work only. Other than that, they are extremely lightweight and I love the look of them.  I wish I would of bought a half size up since I know now that they will not be my running shoes."
New_Balance,4,I’ve always worn 8.5 w.  These run a tad short. My toe is about 1/2” from the end.  Next pair will order a 9.
New_Balance,4,"I’ve bought this shoe in different colors in actual stores and this specific collection runs very small. It doesn’t matter what color, they are just built very weird and tight. I have normal feet, not wide and not narrow. I’m originally an 8.5 but it is WAY too small. A 9 was even squeezing my toes! 9.5 is perfect. My friend wears a size 7.5 and the 9 fits her PERFECTLY in this shoe. Do not order your regular size or you’ll be sending them back! Order 1 to 1.5 size up. Otherwise very light and comfortable. I work in a warehouse and walk over 10 miles a day in a work shift—I don’t go home with my feet aching!"
New_Balance,4,"I’ve had my eye on these shoes for a few months now. I normally wear an 11 in most athletic shoes, with the exception of Nike. I have to order a half size up in that brand. I found these to be the same cause my big toe was smooshed in the top of the shoe when attempting to do a HIIT workout, and it was sore afterwards. The shoe is very cushion-y so I’ll give a thumbs up to that. Had there been a half size up available, I would have ordered that but Amazon reported true to size so I ordered the normal 11. Not a bad shoe for the price.. if only they fit correctly!"
New_Balance,4,"If I had gotten the next size up, they would be perfect."
New_Balance,4,"if you are used to buying NIKE running shoes, I would suggest ordering half a size up in these."
New_Balance,4,"I'm finding I'm not a big fan of these shoes for the following reasons :

- I normally wear a 9. 5 wide but these seem very wide. I feel like my feet are swimming in them.
- I bought the black but it almost looks blue, especially if I put it next to my black clothes.
- if you are looking for very lightweight shoes these will be good for you, extreamly light weight but unfortunately that's not something I love about them.
- Design wise I like these except the tounge part sticks up instead of laying against the foot. It looks a bit weird like I've got a flag on my shoes.

They're not all bad:
- They are comfortable and I don't have any issues with the sole thickness that other reviewers mentioned. No rocks poking me through the bottoms.
- I am able to slip them on and off without loosening the laces which is a big plus for me."
New_Balance,4,In one shoe the material seam is rough so socks do need to be worn also arch support is minimal so you do need to swap the liner out
New_Balance,4,"Incredibly comfortable and stylish as well; they go with jeans, sweatpants and even some dress pants. I recommend these sneakers (* excellent price too)"
New_Balance,4,Insanely comfortable. Magnet is a dark charcoal gray. Consider sizing half a size up. I got a 12 and it’s too small even though I wear a 12 in other NB shoes.  Will have to return.
New_Balance,4,It is comfortable around my bunion so it does what I expected. It does not have a lot of support around the ankle but I am very happy with the comfort.
New_Balance,4,It's a great shoe. I wish it had more arch support but that is about it. Everything else is great.
New_Balance,4,"It's a nice shoe, but does provide much support for walking long distances. A plus is that it did not need a break in period at all and is very comfortable. Because of this, I decided to keep it for shopping and walking short distances. By the way, if you are wanting a dark black shoe, this is not the one. I was surprised when I got outside to see that it is a blackish blue color."
New_Balance,4,It's comfortable but runs small.
New_Balance,4,Its fine
New_Balance,4,It's lighter than competitors product. The truth will come after performance and durability.
New_Balance,4,It's not a bad pair of shoes but they untie themselves a lot. Also I the toe area isn't wide enough
New_Balance,4,"I've been searching for the perfect shoes for HIIT classes. Running shoes don't offer the stability for lateral movements and the other cross-fit/HIIT shoes I've tried are similar to this one... just one thing off. The fit on this one is the best yet, as it stays on your foot well, but not so snug it feels uncomfortable. Where this shoe is not great is the sole- the padding is so thin, it's almost like being barefoot. (Maybe I'll try an insole...) As HIIT classes can offer a lot of variety, I've taken to wearing this shoe only when it's a weight heavy day and unlikely to do running or too much jumping."
New_Balance,4,"I've had to get use to the stretch insert instead of a shoe tongue which makes it a little more difficult to put on your foot. Once on however, they are very comfortable. I walk 2 - 4 miles daily and can't complain about the feel of them, but still don't know if I'd order another pair."
New_Balance,4,"I've never had to size up with any other shoe, but I definitely should have with these. They're cute and light weight, very affordable, but they run small. Listen to the reviews when they say to SIZE UP!"
New_Balance,4,Just needs better for cushions
New_Balance,4,Just received this product and I love the look but the fit was a little small. I usually wear a 9 1/2 and they ran out so I ordered the wide. Had I not I would probably have to return. Hopefully they’ll stretch out a bit. Otherwise I love the shoes!
New_Balance,4,"Lasted about six months, the sole was what failed. I do walk at work and at home, so I would attribute the lifespan to my activity level.
I love the material, it's a little bit softer than a lot of tennis shoes and allows for more comfortable movement while walking
The shoe tongue is also shaped in a way so that it doesn't rub while wearing. The pair I replaced these with I've noticed has been a bit uncomfortable to break in since they're a little different"
New_Balance,4,"Let me start by saying I LOVE these shoes. They're very comfortable and cute. Their only downfall is the very inconsistent sizing. I've purchased these in black, green, and white in the exact same size (10). The green ones- perfect fit. The black ones- about a size too big. The white ones- about a size too small! Not a big deal since Amazon makes returns easy, but don't give up on this shoe if it doesn't come the perfect size the first time. Once you get it right you won't be disappointed!"
New_Balance,4,Light weight and comfortable for a long day on my feet.
New_Balance,4,Light weight but good support.
New_Balance,4,Light weight very comfortable but not much of an arch support I have to use insert for support .
New_Balance,4,"Light,, comfy. Perfect for gadding about. I don’t feel they are a great workout Shoe however. My only complaint is that the insole keeps popping up when I take them off."
New_Balance,4,lighter in color than they looked. plus the top is thin so you can see the bumps from your toes. other than that I like them they are comfortable
New_Balance,4,Lightweight and comfortable.  Wish it had a little more arch support .wore it 1st day for a whole day with no issue.  Haven’t had a chance to try in a fitness setting yet
New_Balance,4,"Lightweight, cheap and comfy but started to stink after only a couple wears even though I wear socks with them. Look more expensive than they are. Will be fine for work."
New_Balance,4,"Lightweight, fits well. Feels good on my feet, fits true to size. Shoelaces untie a lot, even when double knotted."
New_Balance,4,"Lightweight, flexible, comfortable, cute. However, after having had these a handful of months and not beating them up or anything, they're not holding up well. The fabric on one of the insoles is peeling up and I have to smooth it down and hold it in place with a finger when putting it on, and it sometimes bunches up under my heel. They're showing more wear and tear than expected."
New_Balance,4,"Lightweight, wide, comfortable! Great for walking or daily wear."
New_Balance,4,like
New_Balance,4,"Like the design, easy slip on, light weight. One negative, the shoe strings will not stay tied unless you double knot."
New_Balance,4,like the shoe
New_Balance,4,"Like the shoe, not biggest fan of shoelaces as I feel they untie more easily than I like. Also, the first time I wore them there didn’t feel as good as I’d like but then started tying them tighter and now I love them! Besides the shoelaces."
New_Balance,4,"like the slip on sneakers , just wish they had memory foam on the bottom. no complaints otherwise"
New_Balance,4,Love that new blance has wide comfortable shoes that fix perfectly.  I hate having to buy bigger sizes because they are not wide.
New_Balance,4,Love that these feel like wearing slippers to work. You might still need some cushion support insoles if you're standing all day bc the memory foam isn't thick . Over all the most comfy shoes
New_Balance,4,Love the easy on and off these shoes allow while still being laced up tight enough!
New_Balance,4,Love the fit and style of shoe. Soft fabric. Laces need to be double because they don't hold position. comfortable
New_Balance,4,Love the lightweight shoe. Wearing to physical therapy.
New_Balance,4,"Love the look and feel of the shoe however they do run small. I wear a 7.5 in tennis shoes (Nike, Skechers, Reebok, etc) but these are too small. Will need an 8 in these. They're also slip on shoes with laces. I think I would prefer a full lace up but didn't realize it until I tried them on."
New_Balance,4,"Love the look easy to put on, however it runs slightly small."
New_Balance,4,"Love the look of these shoes, but ORDER UP a half size. The memory foam is very comfy. They are very lightweight and sleek (low profile, not chunky). They go with everything. My toe was cramped at the very end of the shoe...just to tight to keep so I had to return and order up a half size."
New_Balance,4,Love the look of this shoe. Fits perfectly WITHOUT socks but even the thinnest pair causes too snug at toes
New_Balance,4,Love the quality of this shoe.  Great for running and weight lifting
New_Balance,4,Love the shoes but gets dirty easily because of the color.
New_Balance,4,Love the shoes! They run very small though. I ordered a size 8. I usually am in a size 8 and these are VERY tight. I am still going to wear them. I’m unsure about how comfortable they are but I have a feeling they are going to hurt my feet because of how tight they are.
New_Balance,4,"Love the slip on and comfort.  There is no plastic in the heel which could bend and warp if you’re someone who slips your shoes on a lot.  The cushioning is good, could be better but fits inserts,so that’s good.  Only thing I didn’t like was that I got a “wide” size and even though there were wide....the arch area was still narrower.  So I have lower arches and I can feel how that Part of my foot overlaps the sole in that area and it’s a potential for blisters"
New_Balance,4,Love the way my foot feels when I first put them in.  But after a while of walking they start to feel a little tight. I’d go up a half size !
New_Balance,4,love them but had to stretch them now were good
New_Balance,4,"Love them! Super cute - sleek aesthetic. Very comfortable with lots of support. The only thing to keep in mind is that they RUN SMALL by one full shoe size. I’m usually an 8, and purchased an 8.5 based on other reviews. They fit fine with very thin socks (like just cotton shoe liner kind of thin) but could have definitely gone with a size 9 to wear with my usual athletic socks. It works fine for what I need them for - just to wear them in clinic - but if I was planning on being more active in this pair, I would have exchanged for a larger size.... I’ll be ordering some size 9 in another color for other uses because I really like them."
New_Balance,4,Love these shoes for my weight lifting - I would size down half a size though if I could redo it. Excellent shoes though!
New_Balance,4,Love these shoes!  I would recommend to order a half size up though...they do run a little smaller than my previous Adidas shoes.
New_Balance,4,Love these shoes! So comfortable!!
New_Balance,4,"Love these shoes, if I could go back I’d order a half size larger though. I have to wear socks, I have some of the no shows, that basically cover toes and heel, the shoes start feeling really tight after a few hours. I’m hoping they will stretch out eventually."
New_Balance,4,Love these sneakers!! So comfy!!! And I need comfort!! My lower back has gone out on me twice. So I need good fitting shoes that support my back. These do that surprisingly and I have been wearing these sneakers over a year.  GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS ON THEM TO.
New_Balance,4,"Love these so far! This is my first pair of new balence shoes. I work 10 hour shifts in a warehouse and was looking for another cheaper pair to add to the rotation. I walk an average 7 miles or so a day.. These are so comfy! I love a lightweight shoe. These also do not have very much arch support but i find this to be more comfortable for me. Flatter shoes always feel better for me. I love the memory foam too! Not to mention how cute and breathable  they are.. We will see how long it lasts. Im expecting these to last 3-6 months for work. I will update as time goes on. I do say they run a tab bit smaller, so .5 size up if you like your toes to be extra roomy."
New_Balance,4,"Love these walking shoes! Very light weight, comfortable and flattering. I wear a size 10 M and they don't make my feet look bulky and clunky!"
New_Balance,4,Love these!  They look great and feel great! Will buy again!.
New_Balance,4,Love these! I have plantar fasciitis and I wore these all day yesterday without my feet hurting!
New_Balance,4,Love these! So comfortable planning on buying another pair.
New_Balance,4,"Love these, very comfortable for casual use, walking. Lose a star for their attraction to dog hair and because the shoe laces do not stay tied!"
New_Balance,4,"Love to wear these shoes all day, in the house for support and stability , when at 60, I’ve NEVER worn shoes inside, (or much outside for that matter)! 😉. Will report back in a few months with updated review with longevity of the shoe."
New_Balance,4,Loved the look but fit snug on my toes. I normally wear a 8 but a 8.5 would have been better on these
New_Balance,4,"Loved the shoe just wished I'd tried it on first I usually wear an 8.5 in other sneakers, but wound up buying a 9 from the shoe store. I returned these at Kohl's and it was the most convient, and stress free return ever."
New_Balance,4,"Loved the style of these but should have ordered larger.  I ordered a 7.5 wide which is generally fine but in this case they run a bit small - especially if you want to wear socks with them.  I have a high arch and there is ZERO arch support in these shoes.  Like other slip on sneakers like this, they take a bit of effort to put on since they don't unlace.  Again, especially if you intend wearing socks."
New_Balance,4,"Loved them but had to return thrm,they run small. They were out of the next size."
New_Balance,4,Make sure you order up a half size. These were not as comfortable as I thought they would be based on the reviews I read.
New_Balance,4,"Many reviews said to size up, that these shoes ran small. I normally wear and 8.5 so went with a nine. I've got some minimal heel slippage and extra room in the toe box. Might work well when traveling and being on my feet all day. I'll keep them. I've got bunions on both feet, so shoes are tricky, but these felt great with no irritation. I think cushy socks will fill the slight gaps. I will order another pair in the 8.5 just to see how they fit. Very comfortable without socks, so a smaller size could be good for no sock days. Love the style. Doesn't look frumpy like some athletic shoes can."
New_Balance,4,May need to get a size bigger than normal
New_Balance,4,Maybe a little too lite for someone looking to do distance
New_Balance,4,"Memory foam is cushy, no seams to irritate toes, feels like slippers. Good “shopping” or running errands shoe. The cedar is “army green” which looked more grayish green in picture. Not ugly just not really what I expected. Support is minimal. Just depends what you’re looking for. If support is important, this shoe is not what you want."
New_Balance,4,"Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn and most breathable. However, after one 12 hour shift at the hospital the fabric on the insole came unglued. By my 2nd 12 hour shift, the black foam under the fabric has begun to wear away and the loose fabric just gets bunched up under my foot. Also, when putting these shoes on for only the second time, one of the loops in the back broke while pulling the shoe onto my foot. Amazingly, the shoes are still comfortable, they just clearly weren't made well or only meant to be worn by people who spend most of their time with their feet OFF the floor."
New_Balance,4,"Most comfortable slip on’s, sleek and stylish. I’ve bought them 3 times!

-Queen"
New_Balance,4,My child has long skinny feet. She usually wears size 6 but with this sneaker we had to buy a size 7. We returned the size 6 which looked like a small 5. The seven fits just right. She loves that it is light weight and cushioned on the inside sole. The light pink color is pretty and the mesh is soft and breathable.
New_Balance,4,My feet are not hurting when I walk and the shoe are comfortable.
New_Balance,4,"My left shoe fit great, but the right shoe fits narrow. I can deal with it, but it just feels weird. They are really cute and a great price. Definitely size up 1/2 to 1 full size! I went up a 1/2 size and glad I did!"
New_Balance,4,"My old nikes I was replacing when I purchased these were 8.5, I sized up to 9 based on reviews. I'm glad I did. The 8.5 would've been too small. I wish I had ordered the wide.  I don't have wide feet, have never worn wide shoes, but I do find these to be more narrow then a typical sneaker. I think these should be categorized as a walking shoe. They don't have a true tongue, they're shaped more like a slip on sneaker. The bottom seems to have decent cushion, I've worn them 4 days in a row on my morning walk and they're comfortable. I like the all grey, that's what initially drew me to these shoes. I didnt want the normal white soul that gets dirty quick."
New_Balance,4,My wife likes the color and comfort but the side support is only fair.
New_Balance,4,"My wife loves the look of the shoe, and easy to put on although not much arch support provided. Extremely light shoe."
New_Balance,4,"Need a little more support  in them, other then they are comfortable"
New_Balance,4,Nice fit. Very pretty
New_Balance,4,Nice light-fitting sneaker for walking but not hardcore fitness.
New_Balance,4,Nice lightweight shoe. Slightly short but works. I wear orhitics inside sole.
New_Balance,4,Nice looking shoe
New_Balance,4,Nice looking shoe but they need insoles. The ones that come with the shoe are paper thin and wear very quickly. Overall I'd recommend.
New_Balance,4,"Nice shoe, my wife likes them. Only one problem, New balance shoes must run small because it’s about an inch shorter than all her other shoes of the same size."
New_Balance,4,"Nice shoes, burgundy is my favorite color so I was excited to try these. They are comfortable for light walking, but I wouldn't wear them for heavy walking as they do not have as much support as some shoes. But I have problem feet, for most people the support is probably adequate."
New_Balance,4,"Nice shoes, not as I expected but nicely put together. Heads up, go a size up or more. I wear a size 9 but ordered a size 9 1/2 and still to small a 10 maybe 10 1/2 would have been better. I just gave them to my child☺
They did come on time, & pack securely❗❗"
New_Balance,4,Nice sneakers. Pretty color. Not much arch support. Not for walking purposes as in distance walking. I’m a size 11 & they were small. Returned.
New_Balance,4,Nice style; order a size larger if you plan to use as running shoes.
New_Balance,4,"No arch support, although I do have high arches. Not made for impact workouts but great to walk in."
New_Balance,4,"no arch support, just comfy.  I like pink and grey combination, so I bought them."
New_Balance,4,No comment
New_Balance,4,None
New_Balance,4,Not a non slip shoe!! Comfortable. But not for use in kitchen environment
New_Balance,4,Not a ton of support for walking or working out. But definitely great shoes to wear while doing errands. My only complaint about them really is that they come untied SO EASILY. I’m bending down to tie them multiple times a day. But they are super comfy!!
New_Balance,4,Not as comfortable as they say they are. They also came with a tear. I kept them because I really hate returning items it's too much of a hassle. But I will not be buying any New Balance sneakers
New_Balance,4,Not enough support for my higher arch; will need to add an aftermarket one. But cute and comfy!
New_Balance,4,"not much padding, good for a solid dark look in shoes"
New_Balance,4,"Not my favorite style, but a great fit and functionality.  Ordered these throughPrime Wardrobe with two other pairs of New Balance and these fit my needs the best so I'm keeping them!"
New_Balance,4,Not quite as much support for pronation as i'd hoped. Cushioned forefoot was comfortable.
New_Balance,4,Not really a running shoe but comfortable for every day wear. Great quality shoe.
New_Balance,4,"not sure why but they feel like tight socks and rub against the tops of my toes. Definitely should've ordered a 10.5 in these particular shoes. Normally I'm a 10, but the way these trainers fit, I definitely could use the extra half inch."
New_Balance,4,Not the color it looks in the picture. Very gold in real life but cute with navy scrubs and comfortable for work.
New_Balance,4,"Not true to size.  Have always worn size 8.  Toe touched end of shoe.  So, had to order 8.5.  Nice shoes, thought.  Very attractive."
New_Balance,4,"Nothing was wrong with the shoe, however, I received a “wide” shoe and I did not order a wide."
New_Balance,4,"Ok, too narrow, wish there was more support on the sides, sole is too narrow. Won’t last too long."
New_Balance,4,"One of the most comfortable shoes I own. I love these and have worn them all summer. They sometimes get a little tight on the top of my foot but nothing a little shoe lacing can't adjust. Also, with them being white, I was worried about cleaning them. Nope! They are SUPER EASY to clean!"
New_Balance,4,One of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.
New_Balance,4,"Only complaint is seem to run on small side. Had to return and go up; other than that I am happy.
Very comfortable and of course the style = HAPPY"
New_Balance,4,"Order a half size larger, you cannot feel it initially but after a days wear, your toe will feel it. Besides that they are very comfortable, easy to style, and overall a great shoe."
New_Balance,4,Order a half size up! Good shoe otherwise
New_Balance,4,Order half a size to a size bigger. This shoe runs small. I’m usually an 8.5 had to return previous shoe and upgrade to a size 9.
New_Balance,4,"Ordered 7.5 wide after reading these shoes fit snug, should’ve ordered 8 wide. My feet aren’t even wide I just wanted the extra space and even the wide fits snug. Got the all black and Love the shoes and how they look, just wish I would’ve listened to the other reviews and ordered a half size up."
New_Balance,4,"Ordered this once in my normal 7.5 wide and it was too small for my toes. Ordered again as an 8.5 wide and it's perfect. I often have to have my toes worked on medically and this shoe fits with bandages and toe separators with room to spare. The bottom is a bit hard though, the soul has no bounce. But I'm sure some Dr Scholl's will fix that."
New_Balance,4,Originally ordered 9. But had to return for 9.5 wide for more room at toe and to have room for sock
New_Balance,4,"Other than needing a half size up this shoe is perfect,  well made, fits well in width this company understands comfort just as i mentioned get a half size up"
New_Balance,4,Over all quality good !! Price fair and they are super cute !! But beware ordered a size larger than you wear.. I wear a 7.5 and should have purchased a size 8. Other than that they are super comfortable ..
New_Balance,4,"Overall I like these shoes.  I often work long hours on my feet on concrete at trade shows.  Although I feel as if my feet aren’t super supported in the arches, my feet never hurt after wearing these shoes.  I would not use them to run in at all but for walking on concrete, they are very comfortable and light."
New_Balance,4,"Overall these are adorable! They are super lightweight, the color is accurate, the comfort is good. There is no arch or real support but that doesn’t bother me. They’re like a good every day shoe. I probably wouldn’t recommend running a marathon in them though. My ONLY complaint is they are a tad small. My normal size is an 8.5. In adidas I’m an 8 and in these I should have ordered a 9. I have worn them multiple times and I do feel like they stretched out a little so they aren’t as tight but a 9 still would have been better. Either way, they are worth the money"
New_Balance,4,People were saying to order a half size up so I did. Too big. Also not a fan of the built in tongue because the shoe is wide and my feet are narrow so when I tie them tight enough the tongue gets messed up. The shoes look great and they’re super comfortable though and I appreciate the wide toe box.
New_Balance,4,Perfect I was needing something with good traction for my high intensity aerobic classes
New_Balance,4,Pretty comfy shoes and love how lightweight they are. Only thing I find is that it doesn’t provide very good arch support but that might just be due to the shape of my feet?
New_Balance,4,"Pretty darn good. I bought these shoes primarily for exercising. They are great for all kinds of workouts, from HIIT to Pilates to weight lifting exercises they are more than sufficient. They fit like a glove (or a sock, I suppose ha-ha) on the foot; I ordered my true size 7.5, as I wanted no wiggle room. Hard to get on with socks, but I prefer to wear them without, so no issue there. Comfortable, stylish, they seem to help with my balance as well. The only thing that disappoimts me is:
1. The color. I thought the shoe was grey and black, but it's actually grey and navy blue. That actually worked out though, because my scrubs are those colors, so I don't have to worry about my shoes matching with my uniforms when I choose to wear these to work.
2. The toe area is creasing. I chalk this up to the vigorous exercise, but considering these shoes were made for that, it's a little upsetting.
However, I will say these issues do not speak to the overall quality and comfort of the shoe. Perfect workout shoes for sure."
New_Balance,4,"Pretty shoe and I bet it’d be great for folks with narrow feet and an arch....which I do not have. Not a bad shoe for the gym. Not super comfortable for walking around with my wide, flat feet."
New_Balance,4,Price was right-? Shoe fit just thin and seemed like small style
New_Balance,4,Put them on and it was like heaven! They were comfortable until the first day I had to stand in them and the memory foam flattened out and my feet started to hurt.  I put a pair of heel cushion inserts in them and now I love them.
New_Balance,4,Quality
New_Balance,4,Quedan pequeños!!
New_Balance,4,"Really comfortable! The memory foam is great.  It’s a good everyday sneaker, but may not offer enough support if you are on your feet all day every day."
New_Balance,4,"Really cute, works with athletic wear and jeans. Love the ease of a slip on. My only complaint is that something in the arch area rubs on my foot. I've not worn them long enough to get a blister but I wouldn't wear these to walk distance in because of that concern. Hoping it's just that they haven't been broken in yet."
New_Balance,4,Really like the look but toe box seems short and flat on toe. Sending back. Will order more.
New_Balance,4,Really like the shoes. They are very comfortable.
New_Balance,4,Really small! Looks and feels 1 1/2 sizes smaller
New_Balance,4,Return it
New_Balance,4,Rubs on the back of ankle
New_Balance,4,Runs 1/2 size too small
New_Balance,4,Runs at least a half size small. I got these and sized up for my pregnancy and am exchanging for a full size up. Hopefully the bigger ones fit better.
New_Balance,4,Runs slightly smaller to size.
New_Balance,4,"Runs small - size up
 Return /exchange was super fast ! But it would have been nice to have a return label emailed to save me a 40 mile trip to UPS"
New_Balance,4,Runs small. I would recommend getting the sneaker a half size bigger than your true size.
New_Balance,4,"Sad that these run so small. I wore them, assuming they’d fit since I haven’t had trouble with my other new balance, and now I can’t return them."
New_Balance,4,"Seemed like a comfortable shoe, but runs small."
New_Balance,4,"Seems like it would be comfy for a narrower foot. My feet are average width, and I just didn't get the support I wanted from them because my feet are wider than the bottom of the shoe."
New_Balance,4,"Shoe looks and feels great.  I wear a 7 most times and in a few shoes I take a 7 1/2.  I ordered the 7 and the shoe length is a little short, my big toes touch the front.  This is the first time trying NB and now I know in the future to order a 7 1/2.  5 star positive review for the fabric, look, feel and minus a star for the shortness.  I would recommend these shoes."
New_Balance,4,"Shoe seemed to be good quality and pretty they were just a little too small for me so I returned them right away.  I usually wear a 9.5, and ordered a 9.5, actually needed a 10"
New_Balance,4,"Shoe was cute, sole had a good grip on the slippery floor. Once tightened, my foot wasn’t over-pronating. Was just a bit too short, will see if half size up is available."
New_Balance,4,shoes are comfortable and look like the picture.
New_Balance,4,Shoes feel great and comfortable. But had to exchange because they were too small. Are usually wear a nine but had to go up to a 9 1/2. Will update review once I use them at work
New_Balance,4,Shoes fit like a glove but no arch support. Soft great fit but have my bottom feet hurting
New_Balance,4,"Shoes run a little small. I have another pair of New Balance sneakers size 6 and these did not fit the same. Definitely go up half a size. Otherwise, awesome shoes and great price!"
New_Balance,4,"Showed up on time, fit great and look fantastic."
New_Balance,4,"Since other purchasers had often reported that the shoe ""Runs small"" I purchased not only a 1/2 size larger than usual, but also a ""Wide.""  On first try-on it fit quite snug, but I assumed it would loosen with a short break-in period. Well, that has happened but if I have an swelling: forget it. Like tight-jeans when you have PMS. Notta !"
New_Balance,4,Size too small thought she'd only have to break them in but they are too small they were a christmas gift.
New_Balance,4,Size up 1/2 size. I wish I had
New_Balance,4,Size up a half size! They’re cute and good for a light workout. The only think i don’t like is the opening where your foot goes in is a set width- you can’t loosen it. So my socks get bunched in the back as i slide my foot in. I just wear very thin socks with them. Overall happy.
New_Balance,4,Size up. I wear a 9 normally and usually size up athletic shoes to 9.5 because feet expand during exercise and my toes were at the end at 9.5 in these. Size up. Had to return.
New_Balance,4,"Sizes run a bit smaller, I should've taken a half size up."
New_Balance,4,"Sizing of the shoes does run small so it would be best to size up. It is a tight fit but not too uncomfortable and bothersome for usage. The shoes are extremely lightweight, almost like your not even wearing shoes. They are stylish and can go with any outfit whether you use them for exercise or causal wear. Overall, I would recommend these sneakers."
New_Balance,4,Slightly small can only wear thin sock. Althought they laceup these are actually slip on. Comfortable for a casual shoe. I wouldn't recommend for sports activities. Not bad for the price.
New_Balance,4,Slip on that looks like a tie up shoe. Fits really snug. Thinking about getting another pair in a different color.
New_Balance,4,smaller than normal size
New_Balance,4,"Sneaker true to fit, though, there's not good arch support at all! Feels like I'm walking flat footed."
New_Balance,4,Sneakers are a good fit and very comfortable.  I'm happy with the quality of these sneakers.  :-)
New_Balance,4,SO COMFY
New_Balance,4,"so cute, and relatively comfy. these are wide, but they’re still a little tight. i would recommend going up like half a size."
New_Balance,4,"So far I love this product it is a little bit smaller than anticipated, wish I would've gotten half size bigger."
New_Balance,4,"So far so good on these shoes! They are cute and comfy for the gym and for being on your feet for a couple hours. I probably wouldn't wear them for an entire day of walking or trekking around, but they are great for what they are.  ORDER 1 FULL SIZE UP. I am a consistent 9.5 in shoes and boots. I ordered a half size up to 10 based on other reviews, but when I tried them on they were tight with my regular gym socks. So I returned them and ordered a 10.5 and they fit perfectly!"
New_Balance,4,"So far the shoe is very comfortable. It's a light weight shoe but seems relatively supportive.
My feet are on the very largest side of medium, and I'm flat-footed,  so most of the time I have to wear new shoes a couple of times before they're comfortable. Not the case with this shoe-- I was out all day the first time I wore them and my feet were fine. And it's a nice looking shoe with clean lines. I may purchase another pair."
New_Balance,4,"So I'm typically between a 8 and 8.5 in most sneakers, Adidas I'm an 8. I read a lot of the reviews and ended up ordering the 8.5. They do fit but definitely almost could have sized up to a 9.  Walking for long periods where your toes slide forward will be uncomfortable if these are to tight. I would not do cardio of any sort in these. Definitely just for running errands and such."
New_Balance,4,So light and comfortable... laces are a bit slippery and come undone easily. The sole is comfortable but not a lot of arch support
New_Balance,4,"So light. When I picked up the box, I wasnt sure if anything was in it. Comfortable!"
New_Balance,4,"So these shoes are so comfy, they fit right, not too high to cut me open and the laces are good too, don't come undone all the time. But my one caveat is there is zero arch support. Which makes me sad. But oh well. Still good"
New_Balance,4,So they came a day early surprised me loved that i wear a size 12 w in women's shoes so i neverr NEVERR order shoes offline it took me a week or two to go with this decision and im glad i did the shoes are very comfortable with or without socks i walk a lot so it seems like the shoes just formed with my feet freakin love these shoes and i plan to buy more
New_Balance,4,Soy talla 6.5 y creo q un 7 me hubiese quedado mejor
New_Balance,4,Still trying to wear But to tight
New_Balance,4,Stylish and comfortable. I love mine. My only issue is the laces need to be double notted tightly or they will come undone. Otherwise excellent purchase. Runs smaller bought a 7 gave them to my daughter. Ordered a 7.5 and was good to go.
New_Balance,4,Suaves
New_Balance,4,"Super comfortable but runs around 1/2-1 size small. I normally wear a size 9 so that’s what I ordered, but had to exchange for a 9.5 which fits better but I honestly probably could have gone to a 10.  I’m a dance fitness instructor so I bought these shoes to wear for my class. I haven’t tried them out for that part yet but I’ve been wearing them around for a few days to make sure they’re broken in and they feel great!"
New_Balance,4,"Super comfortable day shoe. If you’re on your feet for long periods of time, I wouldn’t wear these. Good trainer shoe or day shoe though! Love how cute and trendy they look!"
New_Balance,4,"Super comfortable shoes! I'm usually a 7.5 or an 8 and I ordered a 7.5 and with socks they are just a tad bit snug. I would recommend going the half size up. Other than that, they're great! I will be ordering more in various colors."
New_Balance,4,Super comfy but the cloth part got so dirty so fast :( appears to stain/pick up dust/dirt VERY easily
New_Balance,4,Super comfy with good arch support. I'd highly recommend.
New_Balance,4,"Super comfy! The style is great and they can definitely be worn all day no problem. My only gripe is that they fit a little small length wise. They were too small with thin socks on, without socks they are fine but still slightly tight. Nothing too terrible though. I bought a 10 as I usually do, maybe a 10.5 would have been better.

UPDATE: I don't wear socks with these, and I'm on my feet for 8+ hours at work. These are the best! My ankles don't hurt at the end of the day, and they are super lightweight, I forget I'm wearing them! I can't recommend these enough!!!! Will be buying again!"
New_Balance,4,Super cute . I shoulda sized up. I usually wear a 7.5 but an 8 woulda have fit better
New_Balance,4,Super cute and comfortable. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the insole comes out whenever I take them off. The insole has a sticky bottom so when it comes out it folds and sticks to itself. Now I have a permanent ridge in one of the insoles which makes it slightly uncomfortable but still wearable.
New_Balance,4,Super cute and light feeling. My only complaint is I wish I would have ordered a 10.5 instead of a 10
New_Balance,4,Super cute shoe but they killed my feet! I bought them for a recent Disney trip and my feet would hurt so bad after wearing them for the day. They are light weight but have zero support. My Converse were easier on my feet than these shoes. They are adorable and I would still buy them all over again but I would also make sure I had better ensoles for all the walking.
New_Balance,4,Super cute shoes for running around town. I love the color as it matches everything. I ordered them for work out shoes which they are not but for the price I’m keeping them just to wear out in casual attire. I ordered a half size up since other reviews said they run small & that was perfect.
New_Balance,4,"Super cute, lightweight, and look exactly like the picture. I love them! Not really meant as active/exercise shoes, but that's not why I bought them, so that's fine with me. The other reviews are absolutely right about sizing. I'm typically a size 9 and I ordered a 9.5, and they fit perfectly!"
New_Balance,4,Super cute. Lightweight  sneakers i usually by a 9 to give me some extra room .. well good thing cause they are tight fit . I would recommend  1 size up . I usually do a 8.5 in most 9 for comfy room i should of did a 9.5 for sure . Over all memory  foam love . I dont think they will  last long if they are every day shoes  but weekend to the mall shoes for sure !
New_Balance,4,Super lightweight and comfortable especially for summer. However they do stain SO easily even after spraying with scotch guard.
New_Balance,4,"The arch is a little short.  Runs a tad small in length. Otherwise, comfortable.  Would order half size bigger."
New_Balance,4,The arch support wasn't what I was expecting but they work good for working on my feet all day.
New_Balance,4,The fit is a little snug but I can still wear them! They are so cute and for the most part comfortable.
New_Balance,4,"The fit was perfect, however the arch support really ain’t that great.
A very comfortable and simple style shoe, but not great to wear for a long period of time."
New_Balance,4,The fit. It was like wearing glove on my feet.
New_Balance,4,The left foot is a little small but i love how soft it is.
New_Balance,4,The material is a little scratchy if I wear them with no socks.
New_Balance,4,"The only thing my wife dislikes about it is how her shoelaces come undone every other workout session as she's jumping a lot in the HIIT exercises. Other than that, she really enjoys the overall comfort, support, and lightness of the shoe. Also a stellar price to begin doing HIIT in."
New_Balance,4,The overall shoe is great but it’s strange how on the right sole the rubber has an area that is flapping off so that’s a little annoying.
New_Balance,4,The shoe had very little cushion and they run small.  I had to return them.
New_Balance,4,The shoe is cute light weight and comfortable.  Wide Width is great. There is no arch support and the sole is a lil thin.
New_Balance,4,The shoe is great but it is quite narrow.
New_Balance,4,The shoe is light and cushioned.  Their easy to slide on and off.
New_Balance,4,The shoe is nice and lightweight.  The fit is small.  I normally wear an 8.5 shoe and it was way too small.  I ordered a size 9 and probably could go up another 1/2 size. I would not buy these again
New_Balance,4,The shoe is really cute and light in weight. I like the color and the fabric. The opening of the shoe does not work well for me. It is more like a slip on shoe that ties. I have bunions so the fact that I cannot unlace and open the shoe more makes it a challenge for me to get it on my foot. Sorry to say I will be returning.
New_Balance,4,The shoe is very nice looking. I would buy them again!
New_Balance,4,The shoes are a little bit snugger and the toe area then I would like.
New_Balance,4,The shoes are cute and overall comfortable but run a little tighter than expected. Next time I'll order 1/2 size bigger so the fit is more comfortable.
New_Balance,4,The shoes are great. Just order one size up.
New_Balance,4,"The shoes are really comfortable for me when I wear them without socks.  However, due to the shoes being a tad snug, I have to avoid wearing socks with these shoes."
New_Balance,4,"The shoes are sporty looking and fit my usual 7B feet. I was disappointed that these shoes don’t have adequate foot and arch support. I’ve worn these shoes 3 times and it feels like I’m  walking on pavement. New Balance, I was really looking forward to wearing these shoes for walking 🚶🏻‍♀️."
New_Balance,4,"The shoes are stylish and I like them overall. They just run small. I buy sneakers in a size 9 for extra toe room, and I wear 8.5 in my heels. My toes are at the very top of these size 9 sneakers."
New_Balance,4,The shoes are very comfortable and supportive with memory foam and soft knit. I'm so glad I read  the reviews or would not have known to go up a size. I typically wear a 9 1/2 but went up to a 10. If I had not they would have been too small. I have a terrible time finding a shoe that will fit and also have several foot issues and they seem to help with this. I have not worked out in the shoes and could not rate that function. Overall I'm pleased at this point.
New_Balance,4,"The shoes are very pretty! Great material, stretchy but they were a bit snug! I ordered a size 6.5 (my usual size) should have ordered a 7 but overall great shoes!"
New_Balance,4,The shoes are wonder and comfortable. They fit great but the only complaint I would give is that I wish the heel had some support. The shoes are like slippers and I would buy them again. They are very light weight and comfortable.
New_Balance,4,"The shoes fit great, very comfortable. Do not use with thick socks or you will need half a size larger."
New_Balance,4,"The shoes run small. I wear a 6.5, so originally ordered a 6.5. When I got them they were way too small. so I got a whole size up and they fit perfect"
New_Balance,4,"The shoes were listed as back, but the fabric is woven and appears darkgrey.  Next to the strap - which is ""black"",  the difference is obvious. liked the shoes, but needed something truly black."
New_Balance,4,The shoes were really cute but they run small. They seemed very comfortable just didn’t fit my feet.
New_Balance,4,"The tennis is ver comfortable but in no shape or form can be used for walking or exercise, except lift weights at the gym. While the shape is better than Ryka (remember? however Ryka was sold and falls apart within two months), and it is soft and comfortable, you feel the ground in every step and a 15 minutes walk will tire you, just as if it was a 2 hour walk. The top of the toes, where your nails are, hit the soft cotton of the tennis and it becomes sore if you walk on those shoes, say for one hour. Still, I do recommend those shoes, it is a delight, just not meant for walking, it is definitely not an exercise shoes and if you insist, like a did, the results are listed above."
New_Balance,4,The toe box should have been rounder.
New_Balance,4,The wear is not terrible but the fitment is a bit snug.
New_Balance,4,The width is good for wide but they seem kinda shorter. It fit like thank God my foot isnt still growing. That's why I gave 4 stars
New_Balance,4,The wrong image is shown on Amazon's website for these.  They are different. (I got the magnet color). They're all gray and the sides look different. Shoe is decently comfortable. Will probably keep even though it's not what I expected. Customer service said they would forward my feedback to get correct images.
New_Balance,4,their nice comfortble little hard to put on because top is all one piece
New_Balance,4,"Thes run much smaller than normal. I wear a solid size 9 and these were terribly tight , I had to return AT MY OWN cost and order a 1/2 size up .  Not too happy about paying shipping then shipping to return."
New_Balance,4,"These are a nice, basic shoe that I bought to work out in. They are definitely a little on the small side. I am always a size 8w, very rarely have to make any size adjustments for my shoes but this shoe was small, my toes were touching the front. I would order a half size up. Otherwise, nice design, lightweight, easy to slip on/off. Moderate support. I am a nurse and on my feet a lot, probably would not wear them to work but they are perfect for light workouts."
New_Balance,4,"These are comfy and feel like you’re barefoot.  I wear them with skinny jeans and I don’t feel like they look too clunky. Not really sturdy enough for actually exercising. My only complaint is that the insole is falling apart and folds up, making it feel like my sock is coming off."
New_Balance,4,"These are comfy, easy to clean, and cute. They're very light and easy to get on and off. However, there's very little support. I had to buy additional inserts"
New_Balance,4,"These are definitely fashion sneakers, rather than active sneakers. Top is more of a knit feel fabric than I expected. I love the look of these, little concerned with how durable they will be. But pleased so far."
New_Balance,4,"These are great and super comfy sneakers, but SIZE UP! I am usually a size 7, very rarely a 7.5, and even a 7.5 was too small. I had to exchange for an 8 and they fit perfectly! So I would recommend ordering a full size up from your typical size.

Very light and comfy. Not a ton of arch support due to the memory foam inside. They also wipe clean easily, which is a plus!"
New_Balance,4,"These are great and very comfortable, but make sure you order a 1/2 size up!!!"
New_Balance,4,These are great casual shoes... super comfy and they go with everything!
New_Balance,4,"These are incredibly comfy sneakers.
I wear a size 5, I have never bought another size sneaker. They are a bit snug. I won't return them  but will buy the 5.5 next time."
New_Balance,4,These are lightweight and very comfortable. Great little sneaker.
New_Balance,4,"These are my new favorite everyday support shoes, they're light and super comfy too! The one thing I will say is make sure you look at the shoes on your feet when you receive them before using them too much since mine wrinkle in the front on the left (just a tad). No biggie for me since I'm the only one that notices it."
New_Balance,4,"These are not good for all day walking, felt like my feet were on the ground after a day off outlet shopping. But there are great for regular walks, non labor intensive workdays, etc."
New_Balance,4,"These are okay, they're very lightweight and the sole doesn't even have as much traction as my 5-year-old sneakers (which I got rid of because they were starting to wear on the bottom and lose traction!)
These might be an okay gym shoe but I don't recommend them for outdoor use or for use as a work shoe."
New_Balance,4,"These are pretty good, not the best but light weight and comfortable. I just want a little more support."
New_Balance,4,"These are slim looking on the foot and very flattering.  They are also like wearing marshmallows--super squishy with almost zero real support, sort of like a cute, athletic slipper.  I am a runner and I would NEVER run in these or even work out in them, there just isn't enough substance to the construction.  They are definitely fashion shoes, but I did wear them on a trip to Europe and walking around Amsterdam, they were reasonably good for cobblestone streets, hard floors in museums, etc.  I found that they run small, I am typically a 6 1/2 in Asics, Nike, etc. and needed a 7 in these as they were plenty wide, just short in length.  For what they are, I do like these, but took off one star for flimsy construction.  For the price, they will not hold up as long as they should."
New_Balance,4,"These are slip-on shoes that are somewhat difficult for me, a 70 year old woman, to slip on. The toe is slightly narrow (top to bottom) compared to other New Balance shoes I've worn. They are comfortable once I get them on."
New_Balance,4,"These are super comfy. I saw all the wide sizes, so I figured I should purchase a wide and am glad I did because the wide fits like a normal shoe size. The only problem is the super sharp heel top. Hopefully it gets worn in soon and stops cutting my heel at the top when my socks are thin or slide down."
New_Balance,4,These are very comfortable for me to.
New_Balance,4,These are very comfortable shoes. I was looking for a sturdier walking sole. These are great for around the house and casual wear.
New_Balance,4,These are very comfortable! My only complaint is that it pulls away from your foot on the inside. Almost like the top is too loose. Overall a great shoe though.
New_Balance,4,"These are very cute and fit well, I would go up a half size for the toe box."
New_Balance,4,These are very cute shoes
New_Balance,4,"These are very light and comfortable so far. Have not worn  them for long periods of time but seem to be comfy.
Hopping to  wear them at WDW soon and be comfy all day. Seems like the arch is not too supportive,, we will see.."
New_Balance,4,"These are very light shoes that do not have a great deal of support. They're great for walking. I recommend ordering a half size larger than you normally would and I wouldn't recommend if you need support for probation, etc."
New_Balance,4,These are very light weight! I wear them for my cycling class I go to. There isn’t a lot of support and the shoes are quite flexible but they are comfy! I haven’t worn them for a long period of time yet but I love them!
New_Balance,4,"These do run a little small, I’m a true size 10 and my toes hit the end so I recommend going up a half size. They’re also kind of loose around the ankle part, so it’s an odd fit in my opinion"
New_Balance,4,These just did not fit as well as my other NB of the same size so I returned them.
New_Balance,4,These new balance are cut small once you get the right fit they are comfortable very light on the feet.
New_Balance,4,These really almost feel like slippers. Very comfortable and light. Ran small though.. had to return for the next size up.
New_Balance,4,These run really small! Size up a whole size. Seems like a really comfy shoe though!
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are a bit different from the New Balance I remember, but the appear to be well done.  They are lightweight and very comfortable."
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are adorable. I love the look of them. They do run small, but I knew that before I bought them. Order a half size up and you'll be fine. As others have stated there isn't a lot of arch support built into these shoes, which is the reason for the one-star deducton. I've solved the problem for me by buying a pair of well-known insoles that are purposefully not full length and have great arch support. Then put them under the memory foam insoles the shoe comes with. It is perfect! I can walk all day in them!  Cute shoes, no pain. Win win."
New_Balance,4,These shoes are comfortable for me to work 8 hours on my feet.
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are comfy as far as support go, but they are very narrow. I don’t usually wear wide shoes so it had never occurred to me to order “wide”. I would have either bought these a half size up, or in a wide option."
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are extremely comfortable, ideal for knock-around footwear.  They are not ideal for physical activity because they do not offer a great deal of support."
New_Balance,4,These shoes are great! I do recommend maybe a half size up because they are a little tight around the toe area (I have a bit wider feet). So comfy and can’t wait to wear to work
New_Balance,4,These shoes are just as cute in person. I'm in my feet 12 hrs a day and they are comfortable. The laces have a bead at the end that is weighted and causes them to become untied quickly.
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are light weight and great for casual walking. I bought these because I searched ""shoes with arch support and these showed up as a result. There is NO arch support, you will need inserts if that's  a concern for you."
New_Balance,4,These shoes are lightweight and super comfortable.
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are made for hiit or weight lifting. Definitely don’t recommend for running or walking, but are great for gym workouts, etc. They offer a small amount of support with cushion which i love. I used to buy the new balance 711, but felt they changed over the past two years and not as comfortable so tried these. I’m happy with them and love the memory foam.  Recommend for anyone looking for a shoe for interval training, weights or CrossFit. If you are a runner you know that you shouldn’t wear these shoes. Same goes for anyone walking a lot. You need more support. So for those complaining it is because they are wearing these shoes for the wrong type of workouts."
New_Balance,4,These shoes are so beautiful and well made. The leopard part is a little furry but not over the top the laces have cute gold tabs on the end and the fit is what you need to pay attention to. I normally wear a size 9 in all shoes. I’m glad I listened to the other reviews. I ordered a size 9.5W and so happy I did. They fit perfectly
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are stylish and super comfortable but if you are a person who walks long distances, the amount of cushion in the ball of your foot is lacking a bit when compared to other walking/running shoes."
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are SUPER comfortable and stylish. They look great with jeans. I got them for travelling around Europe and they looked cute and in place with my black jacket. They didn't completely protect my feet from soreness, but I suppose that's unrealistic when walking over twelve miles a day. From being so lightweight, they showed signs of wear fairly quickly. They creased on the toe box and if you step on the backs one time (I mean, you really shouldn't do that anyway) they'll stay creased. I'm going to try to wash them and see if any of that helps. Overall, for the price, a great purchase!"
New_Balance,4,These shoes are super comfy and cute and I love wearing them but they show every speck of dirt or dust. I’ve tried washing them and scrubbing them by hand but the never look clean. I may buy them in a darker color and see if that makes it easier.
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are surprisingly comfy. They're also cute to wear non workout clothes. Only reasons why I didnt give them 5 stars is because due to the way their cut, your ankle socks show(see pic). I dont really care, but someone might. Also, they can kind of bunch up if you tie them tight, as I do. Not sure if it's because I ordered mine wide or not, but they bunch a little right under the tongue(as shown in the pic). Other than that, I'm really happy with this purchase. Would definitely recommend and buy again"
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are very comfortable and lightweight but I haven’t found the right socks to wear yet.  Normal ankle socks show, and my no shows are so low cut that parts of the shoe rub on my skin. I think I’ll love these with the right sock."
New_Balance,4,These shoes are very comfortable to wear for shorter periods of time (5-6 hours on my feet) but if I wear them all day I feel like they don’t provide the support I need. They look very nice and clean up easily with a damp cloth.
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are very comfortable. I normally go up 1/2 a size in tennis shoes, but these seem to run a little big, so my normal size would’ve been fine for the roomier fit I like. Arch support is not great, but I walked around New Orleans all day in them with no issues."
New_Balance,4,These shoes are very lightweight and comfy. A little less supportive than I was looking for but more supportive than say a white Ked or Chuck Taylor type shoe.  The fit was true to size. They are on the narrow side so might be uncomfortable for a wide foot. All in all very happy.
New_Balance,4,"These shoes are wonderful, but I would order 1/2 size up. They work for me, but I would not want to wear too long."
New_Balance,4,"These shoes were comfortable right out of the box, but the insole isn’t durable at all. I’ve only had the shoes for a month and a half and the insoles are permanently compressed and falling apart. The shoes still look new, so I’m trying to find a replacement, but the insole that came with the shoes is narrow and thin and a thicker one makes the shoes too tight. Bummer!"
New_Balance,4,These sneakers are super comfy and stylish but I live in the PNW and have found that slight rain or even walking through damp grass these shoes do not repel water whatsoever and leave my feet soaking wet.
New_Balance,4,"These tennis shoes are the lightest and most breathable shoe I have ever worn. I wear them to work every single day and have recently purchased a 2nd pair to wear at home in my home. They are very comfortable and supportive. Obviously these shoes were not made for stomping through snow and puddles - unless you want wet feet, but they are great shoes for exercise, indoor work and the home. They are also sleek and look stylish."
New_Balance,4,These were a gift.  I had to resend and order 1/2 size up.  She really loved them as far as comfort.  Plans on using them for yoga and on her feet for simple things.
New_Balance,4,"These were going to be shoes for running errands. As soon as I tried them on, my tried and true 8.5 foot, they hurt my toe. They just run small. I’m not going to risk comfort to BREAK IN a shoe that is supposed to be comfy right off the bat. Hope they’ll exchange with no upcharge"
New_Balance,4,These were really comfortable and fit true to size. I just wasn't crazy about the style on my feet so I returned them.
New_Balance,4,"These work well for me.  The sole supplies the support I need for my arthritic feet.  The upper is just stretchy fabric, so not much structure there.  They are a good casual shoe, but they have also walked the dog on occasion."
New_Balance,4,They are a bit tight so I don't think I could exercise in them but they are great for walking around. I ordered half a size but they don't seem like they are even though the tags say they are 10.5
New_Balance,4,"They are a nice pair of sneakers...well fitting but just wish a little more foam insole. I wanted them to,start walking but dont know if they will be comfortable enough as a walking shoe. But they are comfortable for an every day sneaker."
New_Balance,4,They are comfortable and sporty. I was hoping that they would be more sturdy.
New_Balance,4,"They are comfortable. However, I can only use with very thin socks or they would be slightly small. Shoes need to be fitted. But they work!"
New_Balance,4,They are comfy and perfect for everyday or strength training at the gym.  I am concerned at how long the memory foam will last for comfort.
New_Balance,4,"They are cute and comfy but DO NOT SIZE UP. I’m a 9 1/2 so I got a ten, they are massive!! I think that they are wide, it gives you a little extra room. Don’t size up"
New_Balance,4,They are cute shoes but don’t fit me properly so I can’t say if they are comfortable.  I’m sending them back.
New_Balance,4,They are great to walk in all day
New_Balance,4,They are pretty.  Soft in the inside.  And fit well.  But no arch support
New_Balance,4,"They are very comfortable and I’m happy I followed the reviews about going a half size bigger. However, they do not have enough support if you’re on your feet for 8 hrs a day as a waitress"
New_Balance,4,They are very light and comfortable. Wore them walking all day and my feet didn’t hurt until the end of 8+ hours.
New_Balance,4,They aren't as supportive as I would like. They also run a bit small.
New_Balance,4,"They definitely run a little tight. I normally wear a 7.5 and sized up to an 8. I probably could have even gone up to an 8.5. They are cute though and work well enough. I wish they had a bit more support, but they're fine. I do orange theory, which is HIIT workouts. If you need more support I would look for a different shoe though as they are a little flat with just the memory foam sole. The sole doesn't seem to come out, at least not easily, so you can't replace it with a different support insert."
New_Balance,4,They don't have as much support as I like but are cute
New_Balance,4,They fit fabulously - they feel great on the feet - they make walking a joy!  The only thing they are missing are arch supports - that's why no 5 stars.  BUT - they're almost the best!
New_Balance,4,They have a cute look to the shoe but the insert that comes with it is completely flat. No support at all. Once I put a insert of my choice inside I loved these shoes.
New_Balance,4,They run a half size small
New_Balance,4,"They run small. Had to go up a full size. Once I found the size to fit, they fit well . Feel good, look good."
New_Balance,4,They run small. I’m usually a 5 but they were very tight. I exchanged it for 5.5 but even then they were tight.. should have gotten a 6..  other then that amazing shows! Super light weight. I received a lot of compliments on them!!!
New_Balance,4,They're super nice shoes. Really comfy and cute but they were way too small. I bought an 8 and it fit like a 7 so I had to return and purchase a new size. If you're buying a pair please save yourself the hassle and just get a half size up. I'm hoping the new pair I ordered will fit better. Other than the size they're great!
New_Balance,4,"This a very lightweight cross trainer.  I wore it on a long travel day that included lots of walking through airports and a museum.  They were great, no hot spots or blisters.  My feet were very comfortable. Definitely recommend these shoes."
New_Balance,4,"This appears to be a nice shoe, but it runs a size smaller.  Order a size up!"
New_Balance,4,This brand definitely runs small. I have a half size bugger than I usually wear and should have gone up a full size bigger. Just an fyi
New_Balance,4,This is a cute shoe. Feels good on except it’s a bit too short for my size 10 feet.
New_Balance,4,This is a cute shoe. Feels good on except it’s a bit too short for my size 10 feet.
New_Balance,4,This is a cute shoe. Feels good on except it’s a bit too short for my size 10 feet.
New_Balance,4,"This is a cute/classy shoe for casual wear or weightlifting. The material is thin and can appear ""cheap"" but it is lightweight and comfy."
New_Balance,4,"This is a good shoe but don’t try to buy a 7M here. I tried twice and just kept getting sent 7w!

It’s not a bad shoe but they do run large. They’re very flexible and soft sided so folks who want support will be disappointed."
New_Balance,4,This is a nice all around shoe for work or strolling or anything casual. Lots of good cushioning for comfort. This is not a training shoe. Too much cushion and not stable enough for training.
New_Balance,4,"This is a really comfortable slim shoe for walking or light activity, or if you work on your feet. They wouldn’t be good for heavy exercise where you need a supportive shoe. They run quite small- I ordered my normal size 8 and my toes hit the end uncomfortably. Next time I’d order up a half size."
New_Balance,4,This is a very comfortable sneaker the only draw back so far is because of the mesh material the cold winter air goes right through it. But I love the comfort it gives. Also my insoles fit quite nicely in it.
New_Balance,4,"this is a very light, low profile shoe. it does not have a lot of support, it is similar to a barefoot-type shoe. it's very comfy though. at first it felt like it might be too small, but really it just fits kind of like a sock."
New_Balance,4,"This is an absolutely adorable shoe!  Unfortunately, I had to return it because they ran so small. I typically wear a 10.5 and I ordered an 11 so I could wear them with thicker socks. I could barely get them on my feet. So bummed!!"
New_Balance,4,This is the second time I have purchased these great shoes however this time the same size shoe was considerably smaller than the originals. I would say they run 1/2 size small.
New_Balance,4,"This item is comfortable with socks are. But with socks on,not so much. I wore them they gutted at first, but I wore socks. That might be stretched them. I took the shoe strings out its. Has hot beautiful colors. I like them the second time I wore them the price good."
New_Balance,4,"This shoe is adorable but the sole is fairly thin. I can't wear without a sock because the area where you tie the shoe has seams that rub the top of my foot. I have thin, narrow feet and it's snug, esp at the top. If you loosen the shoe laces, it's too loose on the ankle. Wearing socks helps a lot. I thought I could put in my orthotic but the pad is glued in a bit."
New_Balance,4,"This shoe is very comfortable on the soles of my feet, but they feel tight at the top of my feet and the laces won't stay tied. I had to remove the laces to keep from having to stop and re-tie them when I'm out walking."
New_Balance,4,"This shoe slips on easily, and wears comfortably!  Reminds me a lot of birdies, without the water proofing.  It is light, with some, but not a lot of arch support (I do suggest inserts). I tend to walk the line of regular & wide fit, and size 8, 8 1/2. I prefer athletic shoes to be more fitted to avoid blisters, and ordered the 8 wide, however wish that I had gone with the original fit.  The wide would be perfect for someone with a VERY broad foot/ankle.  When I tie the shoe, there is a lot of cinching at the tongue/front, and a bit too much toe/heal room, causing unwanted movement.  Love the design, fits on the large side! Hope this is helpful!"
New_Balance,4,This shoes are so comfortable! The memory foam insole is great. My only complaint is I like to wear these without socks and the insole will move on you when you take them off so be careful to put it back correctly because they are memory foam it will stay in that position.
New_Balance,4,This style runs about 1/2 size smaller then previous NB shoes that I have worn.
New_Balance,4,"This was a nice, sneaker!  Unfortunately it just didn't fit my foot.  Tried sizing up but it was still hitting the toes.  I will try a different style."
New_Balance,4,thy were a little slipery 4 a runing shoe
New_Balance,4,"Tight across the top where the elastic band is and can be too tight as the day goes on. However the rest of the shoe feels large and my foot slides around inside. They are fine for day to day, but not for exercise or a lot of walking."
New_Balance,4,To wear. Looks good.
New_Balance,4,Too narrow and a bit to small
New_Balance,4,Too narrow and short
New_Balance,4,Too small even when i ordered a bigger size. Too narrow. Maybe i just have big feet. Who knows. Great looking shoe though. Was really flexible and sharp
New_Balance,4,Usually wear a size 8 but had to send back for a 8.5. Very comfortable and light-weight shoe.
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable and good-looking shoe. Returning because they are too small. I normally wear an 8-8.5. I ordered an 8.5 and they were too small. I like them enough to order a size up.
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable and light weight. I got wide width and one size larger in order to fit my custom orthotics.  They’re not a heavy duty running shoe with extra support but adequate for walking.
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable and light weight. My wife loves them for knocking around.
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable and stylish!
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable just what I expected
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable shoe.
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable shoe.  Were giving to my daughter for Christmas and she loves them.  She normally wears a 7 and after reading the reviews they run on the smaller size so I ordered an 8 and fit perfectly.
New_Balance,4,"Very comfortable shoes & true to size! Affordable price & fast shipping. The only Con I have is that I ordered color Black, but these look like a Metallic Navy Blue with a Black bottom. So it's not depicted as described. I'm still satisfied overall with my purchase."
New_Balance,4,"Very comfortable shoes. I wear them for literally everything and have for the past few months. However, I took away a star because they don’t fit as expected. I usually wear an 8.5 to 9 and had to send these back originally and get a 9.5 for them to fit."
New_Balance,4,"Very comfortable, and a good look.  The all-black sneaker looks pretty cool!"
New_Balance,4,"Very comfortable, but doesn’t have enough support to be a long distance walking shoe.  I plan on wearing them for everyday type activities.  Quite stylish as well"
New_Balance,4,"Very comfortable. Feels more like I'm wearing socks than sneakers. Great for casual wear, but not so great for wearing all day at work."
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable. I originally bought them for cross training but have chosen to use them as casual wear instead. The reason? These shoes have almost mesh tops and sides. Super comfy but I wouldn't call them cross trainers.
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable. Love I can slip them on and off with them tied. Stretchy material. Fits my wide feet comfortable. Will get a 2nd pair in case they discontinue
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable. My wife is very happy with the fit.
New_Balance,4,Very comfortable. Ordered a size up.
New_Balance,4,"Very comfy - great for walking, running errands. Love that they are slip off and on without having to lace and unlace every time you put them on and take them off. Great buy!"
New_Balance,4,"Very comfy, I wear them at work almost every day and they help keep my feet from getting sore."
New_Balance,4,Very comfy.  I wear them around the house while I telework.  Very light weight.  Would love if they came in a wide width they are just a little snug but not painful.  The soft grey color I got is really nice goes with lots of things.
New_Balance,4,Very comfy. Wish was a little thicker.  Feet get wet I just dewy grass!
New_Balance,4,Very cute! No real support for walking but great for short distances or jumping in/out of a car.
New_Balance,4,"Very cute, cozy insole but sometimes it bunches up when you slip them off which is annoying. They're very comfortable."
New_Balance,4,"Very cute, lightweight, but runs about half a size too small."
New_Balance,4,Very light and comfortable. The stitching on the under side of the entry near the bottom is a little rough on the top of my foot.
New_Balance,4,"Very light comfortable sneaker, wearing them is like wearing slippers. I love them and I fell I could walk for miles in them"
New_Balance,4,"Very light shoes, super comfy. Sole complain is that they're way too wide."
New_Balance,4,"Very light weight and pretty comfy.  Only down side is , they do let the smallest amount of water in if you happen to be outside after some rain. I also found they run a bit big."
New_Balance,4,Very light weight shoe. But comfortable.
New_Balance,4,Very light. Almost like being barefoot. Very comfortable and breathable. Sprayed with scotch guard to avoid staining at work and I’m in heaven!
New_Balance,4,"Very lightweight - cool & comfortable to wear - love the color (""oyster pink"").  I wouldn't use them for more than casual wear, as they don't have enough structure for most athletic pursuits - but they're cute & perfect as a knockabout sneaker type shoe ..."
New_Balance,4,"Very lightweight shoe, it does run small.  I usually wear a size 9 in a tennis shoe but it was too small so sent them back and got a 9 1/2.  They are very comfortable."
New_Balance,4,Very nice shoes!!! Comfortable lightweith great lovet
New_Balance,4,Was taken back a little when I first put them on but after a few minutes it was like I didn’t have shoes on. So comfy. Wore them all day shopping . So don’t know about working out in them.
New_Balance,4,"Wasn’t sure what a “trainer” was but have had luck with NB in the past so ordered this one. This shoe is comfortable & lite weight. But it isn’t a “cross trainer,” which usually has more support for aerobics.  I use it for my jazzercise classes, but added an insert for more support."
New_Balance,4,We travel and visit lots of national parks so I needed shoes that would stay comfortable while taking in all the sights.
New_Balance,4,Wear these to the gym and for crossfit. 5 stars for comfort. A little more roomy in the tongue area than I would like. Definitely a cost effective option for crosstrainers.
New_Balance,4,Wearing without socks is a little annoying because of how the inside is made.
New_Balance,4,"What can I say, These are nice shoes. They look great with shorts, leggings, and jeans. It took a while to break them in. The tops of the shoes dig into the tops of my feet and hurt. The only thing I don’t like is the soles of the shoes have absolutely no traction. If there is even a little bit of water on whatever surface you are walking on you WILL slip so be careful. Other than that they are great and look great on. I will definitely be getting another pair in a different color"
New_Balance,4,When I first tried them on the toe box was too tight but once I broke them in after a couple wears they fit perfectly and slip on 123! Good walking shoes
New_Balance,4,"When these sneakers first arrived, I thought I would have to return them. They seemed to be very narrow and I use an orthotic. Somehow, the orthotic fit and they are very comfortable. I put on some lock laces to make it be a one hand operation. I specifically bought these to wear after having rotator cuff surgery. Putting on socks and shoes can be very difficult with one hand but these are easy. I also believe they’re very comfortable. I just felt it was strange how narrow they are for the size."
New_Balance,4,"Wish I could have keep this shoe as it was comfortable but ran small. Reading some mixed reviews on whether the shoe ran true to size, I decided to order my regular size of 7.5 but in a wide width rather than a 7.5B. I should have ordered an 8B. The toe box was a great width."
New_Balance,4,"Wish I would have gone up a half size bigger, I got wide and figured that would be good but they run small."
New_Balance,4,With new balance always order a size larger I should have ordered two sizes up as I wanted to add inserts
New_Balance,4,"With the issues I have with my feet, I usually have to wear running shoes with custom orthotics. So I was pleased to find shoes that were a bit more stylish and look good with many things I wear.  My orthotics did not fit in these shoes but I was able to make do with other orthotics.  These shoes will not work for me for long walks but I'm okay with that.  I'm happy that I purchased them and will consider other colors."
New_Balance,4,Work in a busy office on my feet . These shoes are amazing . Lightweight and comfy . I wouldn’t exercise  in them but they are great for every day use .
New_Balance,4,Would have given 5 stars but it has an attached tongue & photo looked like it was. Not good for people with AFO's.
New_Balance,4,"Would have rated a 5, but the fit was a little off. I'd buy it again only a half size bigger.
Very comfy"
New_Balance,4,"Would’ve loved these shoes, but they were a half a size too small. I got my normal size, but they were snug"
New_Balance,4,Yes
Nike,4,A bit small but was able to exchange
Nike,4,a couple stains on the left shoe but overall great fit! super comfortable and affordable!!
Nike,4,A little big but good fit
Nike,4,a little small but I kept
Nike,4,Absolutely love this show!
Nike,4,Adorable but run small
Nike,4,Awesome shoe!!
Nike,4,"Beautiful shoe...comfortable, but a little snug in the toe area."
Nike,4,bought a 7EE and a 6.5 reg width for comparison and because the EE only comes in black. SAME FOOTBED AND SOLE! but the extra wide had more mesh upper material and was significantly roomier. keeping both cuz they are cute but the EE more tolerable and accomodated a bunion. had to break them in for a day or so but good shoe for nike which does not cater to special orthopedic needs.  these are the only nike shoes i can wear comfortably.
Nike,4,Box was kind of bashed up but the contents were fine.  Love the color.  It was hard finding the size on Amazon.  Limited options this time.
Nike,4,comfortable for walking all day
Nike,4,Cute just like picture.
Nike,4,Excellent
Nike,4,Fine.  Expensive
Nike,4,Fit as expected
Nike,4,Fit as expected.
Nike,4,Fit great and just what my daughter needed!
Nike,4,Fits as expected
Nike,4,"Fits as expected. The toe of one shoe was curled up from being in the box, makes it slightly uncomfortable. However we're hoping that relaxes. Otherwise very happy with shoe and transaction."
Nike,4,Fits daughter legnth wise but gets narror around ball of foot and she complains they're too tight.
Nike,4,Fits perfectly
Nike,4,Fits well. Light shoe. I think it may ware out sooner than a high priced shoe but is very comfortable to wear.
Nike,4,Gift
Nike,4,Good
Nike,4,Good
Nike,4,Good
Nike,4,good for the price
Nike,4,Good quality product
Nike,4,Good shoe nice for work
Nike,4,Got them for my daughter and she loves them.
Nike,4,"Great fit and feel, but ""solar red"" apparently means ""the brightest florescent pink""."
Nike,4,Great fit good support decent delivery time thank you
Nike,4,Great product
Nike,4,Great quality except for one thing. We put these in the washer like all other Nikes. And when they came out they were ruined. The back hard part was bent and crumbled and the shoes are now too small.
Nike,4,Great shoe
Nike,4,"Great shoes but not made for long usage. They actually start hurting the back of your foot if you have to be walking around for, say, more than 6 hours."
Nike,4,Great shoes I love them!! The only complaint is the left shoe the tip is crooked. Very weird but still fits very comfortable and I run every day
Nike,4,great shoes. but the price is double than the stores
Nike,4,I am a nurse and on my feet all day and the shoes are very comfortable. I also love the style.
Nike,4,"I bought it in my normal size, but was wrong... but I think it was my mistake. Still, it’s my favorite design so far"
Nike,4,"I bought this for my great-grandmother and she loved them,even though she doesn’t wear them a lot because she thinks they’re to pretty to mess up.But they fit perfectly and they look exactly like in the pictures."
Nike,4,"I don't like to wear my running sneakers around or to low impact classes at the gym because it wears them out too quickly.  I found these and the price was perfect for an extra pair when I don't need a lot of support.  They're very lightweight, but offer very little support, so I do still wear Superfeet inserts with them for some arch support."
Nike,4,"I got the men's Tanjun's for my little brother and they looked so good on him that I decided to get myself a pair. This shoe looks great on, but I am dropping a star just because it fits a teeny bit small. I am a size 8.5W, and the 9 of these shoes fit me a bit snug. I usually wear a regular 8.5 for sneakers so this is definitely odd. I think the 9.5 will be too long, however, so I'm sticking with this pair. Hopefully they will fit more loosely once broken in. Otherwise, these sneakers are cute and comfy for casual wear! Black looks super sleek too!"
Nike,4,I hate the color. I will be returning.
Nike,4,I like the color & how comfortable they are! My son loves them!
Nike,4,I like this shoe because Nike is a great brand and they last a very long time. I wear this shoe EVERYDAY and I still have the old pair. I have had them over just 10 months and the only place they are worn is the bottom. Pretty durable if you ask me.
Nike,4,I liked the color of the shoe but the size is little small I should have ordered a 9 and half.
Nike,4,"I LIVE in these sneakers. Never have I owned sneakers with zero break-in time. NONE at all.
I walk 6-8 miles a day and they are terrific. No foot pain anywhere, no tiredness, great level of comfort and support.

My 2 issues are
1. (A petty whine here) Laces are soooooo long.
2. (bigger issue) They wear out in about a month for me. I have bought 4 pairs since May (just started on pair 4). I noticed the circular rubber grips on the sole begin to wear in 3 days and are totally gone/flat in week 3-4. Gone. Completely. Smooth as a baby’s bottom. That’s about 150 miles so I’m thinking it’s my regiment and not the shoes, per se. Still, $65 a month on walking/running sneakers is steep.
The immediate comfort is worth it to me because I have a huge issue with blisters. As a woman with a wider foot from a severe break years ago, I order a men’s size 8. They fit tightly from the padding for the first 10 miles and then get relaxed inside but don’t order up - you’ll be sliding around in them.

My son has very thin feet and wears a woman’s 12."
Nike,4,"I love everything g about them except for the shoe laces. They seem to come undone easily but other than that, they're great. Highly recommend them."
Nike,4,I love the basic colors and how they’re Used in the shoe style. They’re so simple but cute?
Nike,4,I love the style and look of these shoes! They’re very lightweight and comfortable for a wide foot. I have plantar fascitis and feel like they also offer good support for that. The one complaint I have is that the mesh material lets water in the shoe and therefore I can’t wear these when it’s damp or raining.
Nike,4,I love these for the gym. As expected. Great price -Sierra
Nike,4,"I loved it. It's so comfortable. However, I found this product in the Nike website even cheaper and I returned it to amazon and bought from Nike."
Nike,4,I luv the shoe it is a amazing comfy shoe.Only complaint is I wear a 7 and it's a little snug.
Nike,4,"I put these on the sole of my regular tanjuns  of the same size but B width, and there was no difference.  I bought them to wear while recovering from surgery on the big toe joint hoping they would be larger to accommodate the swelling.  My old regular tanjuns are more comfortable."
Nike,4,I really like the shoe overall but the support is soft.
Nike,4,"I really like these sneakers.  I have  trouble finding sneakers that fit, but these are probably the closest to being the most comfortable.  Would definitely recommend."
Nike,4,I saved it for my yougest
Nike,4,I thought I was ordering all black. Ended up with black and white.
Nike,4,"I typically take a 9.5M in a sneaker, however, these seem to run smaller so I ordered a 10 and that was what I needed.  I like these."
Nike,4,"I use this product for walking. I walk 10K steps or more daily. These sneakers fit very comfortably. When on, it feels like I'm walking bare foot. I wish there were more color choices in my size."
Nike,4,"I'm on my feet a lot at work, so I wanted a comfortable shoe. I followed the reviews that said the shoe was true to size, but I definitely should have gotten the next size. My toes feel slightly smooshed."
Nike,4,It was a present
Nike,4,Just what I wanted
Nike,4,"La zapatilla me que un poco más grande porque ,no es la medida exacta ya que soy 38 y me llegó 38.5 en talla de europeo."
Nike,4,Light but very flat.
Nike,4,"Like the shoes and how they keep my feet from getting too hot. They are quite comfortable and fit well.

Don’t like that the soles are so slippery I am limited in when I can walk and run. I slipped and almost fell when the roads were wet a few times."
Nike,4,"Liked most -style
Liked least-nothing"
Nike,4,"Likes: light weight, sizing is accurate, breathable material, fit is good
Dislikes: arch a little too low for me, heel cushion could be a little more soft as well.

Overall: good shoe though!"
Nike,4,Looks good. Could use more cushioning
Nike,4,Love bike these run a lil small but love them just gotta break them in and wear thin socks!
Nike,4,Love how light weight these are on my feet! So cute and slim. Not bulky looking like most tennis shoes. Only thing is change is more support in my arch. Great buy.
Nike,4,"Love it. Super cute super light, it was a little tight for some reason maybe bc they are new? But still, love them."
Nike,4,"Love the look of these, but they are not great for working out.  I wear them for style.  I took a walk in them and had shin splints for days after."
Nike,4,Love these shoes! They do fit a little tightly in the toe area but not so much that it's bothersome. They look exactly like photos. Arrived in a timely manner.
Nike,4,"Love these shoes, they help reduce feet pain but are not as slip resistant as my last shoes."
Nike,4,"Love these sneakers, but a week later I found the exact same sneakers at Macy's for half the price."
Nike,4,more narrow than i'd like but overall functional and will use for sure!
Nike,4,My sister got a size 9 and they fit me perfect so when I bought mine I got a size 9 but they are a little small
Nike,4,"My son has normal feet (not wide) and yet these are somewhat tight on him. He has to wear thin socks or else he complains they are too tight. I do like the style/structure of the shoe though, so would still recommend. If your child has wide feet, then I would not recommend this shoe."
Nike,4,My wife likes them
Nike,4,Nice and comfortable
Nike,4,"Nice everyday sneaker. Super lightweight, which is what I was looking for. I normally wear a size 7, and the 7 fit perfect."
Nike,4,"Nice looking, comfortable and good price."
Nike,4,Nice shoe just a little too small and not quite what I was looking for.
Nike,4,"Nice shoes, comfortable."
Nike,4,Nice shoes. Fit tight
Nike,4,Nike runs a tad small but great shoe
Nike,4,Not as advertised. Photo was black on black with white sole. I received black with white Nike and white sole. Which sucks since I already own that pair. Wanted black on black with white sole.  These are very comfortable great shoes just didn’t receive color scheme as pictured in photo. PITA
Nike,4,"Not as much cushion as expected, but still comfy. Bought a size larger as many said it ran small and they fit well."
Nike,4,Okay not great
Nike,4,Overall good but noticed wear/tear in less than a month and I’ve only used it for walking...
Nike,4,"Overall I like the shoes great fit and all, and came on time... my only issue is the price say one thing and I paid a whole different amount.. is says like $50 and I paid $85 and they are not worth that not even in Nike website"
Nike,4,Perfect comfortable shoes!!
Nike,4,Perfect for my grandson
Nike,4,Pretty average shoes. Not near as comfortable as my other nikes. Very cheap padding in the arch with not much support. Seller is great.
Nike,4,product was as described and fit well. However the package came soaked with some gue all over it that smelled like soap and the box looked like it had been ran over and dented. it was the worse condition of packaging ive ever seen.
Nike,4,"Pros- Beautiful shoes, great quality, comfortable and stylish

Cons - brought a 6.5 they are a little tight but most new shoes need to be broken into. Should have brought a 7."
Nike,4,Really confy
Nike,4,Runs small
Nike,4,Runs small go up half size
Nike,4,"Seems to have flattened out a little, a month or 2 in."
Nike,4,Shoe is cute but too small. I would at least size up.
Nike,4,Shoe is great but the size is somewhat small.
Nike,4,Shoe runs 1/2 size smaller.
Nike,4,Shoes are great!
Nike,4,So comfy!
Nike,4,"So I’ve been wearing these shoes since I got them mostly for work, they are comfortable and lightweight. No problems whatsoever besides the logo on the Tongue of the shoe peeling off within the first week on one shoe and then the same happening a few days after to the other shoe. It doesn’t look bad. You wouldn’t be able to tell unless you really were looking for it."
Nike,4,"Strong, firm and durable, and breathable material."
Nike,4,Style is good
Nike,4,Super cute shoes and seem to be supportive enough! I have had an ankle fusion so I HAVE to have supportive shoes so I’ve only wore them for 1 day but I will update!
Nike,4,The piece on the back of the ankle digs into your ankle and makes them really uncomfortable with low rise socks.
Nike,4,"The shoe laces stick out after they are tied, but are manageable."
Nike,4,"The shoes are true to their size. They are light and supportive, plus they’re stylish and sporty. The price was fair and the shipping was fast."
Nike,4,The wide with is more like a half size larger. Takes some getting used to.
Nike,4,there's a permanent bump in the fabric where my big toe curls when I walk...
Nike,4,These fit great they are very light and they are very comfortable.
Nike,4,"These look great.  If I didn't have a toe problem, they would fit great too."
Nike,4,"These shoes are so comfortable, but be sure to buy a half size up as they run small."
Nike,4,"These shoes are very nice. I bought them for work in a restaurant. Though not non-slip, they are comfortable and my feet don't hurt like they used to coming off a shift. They did give me bad blisters on my heels as I broke them in, but inserts and bandaids helped with that. Overall, recommend!"
Nike,4,These shoes were expensive but definitely worth purchasing.
Nike,4,They are very comfortable. The perfect work shoe. Only problem is they are NOT water resistant! The slightest puddle will soak your feet.
Nike,4,"They were a good fit, buy I ordered them in gray and recieved white..don't like the white."
Nike,4,"This shoe fit my daughter's narrow foot perfectly. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because the shoe is practically foam and mesh which is fine for most days, however, we made the mistake of wearing them in the rain and her socks got soaked. Seems there should be some level of water resistant protection for $50+."
Nike,4,Use them for work since I stand all day. Very comfortable!!
Nike,4,Very comfortable for walking. Not the most attractive shoes I have ever had though.
Nike,4,Very comfortable shoes. Impressed . Very pleased with purchase.
Nike,4,"Very cute shoes and just as described and pictured on the site. They do run slightly small. I usually wear a size 9 and that’s what I ordered, but they’re a little too snug.  I’m hoping they will stretch out a little as I wear them"
Nike,4,Very ddtusfied
Nike,4,Very lightweight!
Nike,4,"Very lightweight, comfortable shoes"
Nike,4,Very soft and comfy
Nike,4,VIen
Nike,4,��🏻
UA,4,“The shoe is comfortable and supports my ankle and step without any issues.” My fiancée shared her experience with the shoes.
UA,4,"A tad smaller than expected, but I have not worn Under Armor shoes before. I ended up switching them for a half-size larger.
Quality is better than I was expecting.
What I wasn't expecting was the live brown recluse spider. (No fault on the seller, blame Amazon fulfillment.)"
UA,4,After reading the reviews of the size running small I still ordered my true size (size 8) and sure enough they were too small. I exchanged them for a size 8.5 and although I’ve only worn them around the house the size and comfort seem good so far. Still have yet to workout in them.
UA,4,Bueno
UA,4,Comfortable and true to size.
UA,4,"Comfortable shoes except they rubbed a blister on both heels when I walked 4 miles in them as part of the break-in processs.  I primarily bought them as gym shoes for weight lifting, not running as they have more of a heel to toe drop (12 mm) than I like in a running shoe.  They are lightweight and except for the heels, comfortable.  They will work fine for gym/weightlifting shoes but I wouldn't run in them because of the heel rubbing issue.  I bought a wide width (7.5) and usually wear an 8 regular width (hard to find the wide widths) and found these longer than my 8s and very comfortably wide across the toe box."
UA,4,"Comfortable walking shoe, cute love the color, but go up a 1/2 size I wear a 7 1/2 . Lots of compliments received"
UA,4,Comfy
UA,4,Comfy & love the style
UA,4,"Corren pequeños, medio size maa pequeños"
UA,4,Cute and comfy. Material was doesn't than I thought but still Like a allot.
UA,4,Cute shoes and would comfortable but they run big and wide. I wear a 7 and really needed a 6.
UA,4,"Cute shoes,  well made but unfortunately they  seem to run small. I had bought these for the gym and within minutes after starting my run I had blisters on my heels and noticed my toes getting uncomfortable. Back to Asics for me!!"
UA,4,Delivered diffrent product and diffrent size
UA,4,Excelente
UA,4,fine for my usage
UA,4,Fit fine.
UA,4,Fits as expected and love them
UA,4,"Fits perfect,  love them"
UA,4,"fits perfect, my wife loves the shoe, but didnt get what was on the picture, it was solid black, with  no green in it, like the pic, but my wife needed it, so she kept it"
UA,4,Good comfort and support but a bit of a tight fit.
UA,4,Good fit.. a bit stiff feeling when on but offers good support.
UA,4,"Good for walking, cute but I personally need more support and cushion for running."
UA,4,Got what I expected!
UA,4,Great shoe
UA,4,Great shoe value
UA,4,Great shoes for my daily walks and cute too!
UA,4,"Have to return them. Normally wear a size 8 1/2. Received them today, but they are too small. Was going to order a 9, but they are out of that size. Will watch to see if they come back in stock."
UA,4,I actually bought these for my daughter. Shes a size 11 wide. They fit me a 10 wide. And omg they are amazing. So I ordered a size 12... thought they would fit her.... NO! They did not fit her either. They were still too small. Her foot went from a a lot cramped to a little less cramped and I don’t think they have bigger than a 12. I’m really impressed with the comfort as I kept the size 11. But I’m really disappointed that they can’t get thier sizing right.
UA,4,I am not unhappy with the shoes at all. The shoes are very comfortable I did read the reviews to size up so normally I wear and 8.5 and I went with a 9 and I am glad I did.  I am unhappy that the very next day Amazon dropped the price $10 and when I called they wouldn't honor it.  I would have had to return them and order again.  I don't live in an area that it is easy to do that.
UA,4,"I bought a pair but they were very uncomfortable. I returned them and got a size larger than i normally wear, they felt a lot better. I stand and walk for 16 hours per day and these shoes are very comfortable. This is my first pair of UA shoes and it probably won’t be my last."
UA,4,"I bought a size 8 Reebok Float-ride sneakers but it turned out to be small on me.  So, I got a size 8.5 but it’s still small. I never had size 9 sneakers before. I wonder if my feet really grow or their sizes are getting smaller. 🤔"
UA,4,I bought these for everyday wear. These run small. I typically am a 7 but I like ordering a 7.5 in tennis shoes for comfort. These definitely fit like a smaller 7. I’m probably going to return them.
UA,4,I bought these shoes for my girlfriend and she loves walking and running them. They feel very supportive but a little tight near the toes.
UA,4,"I don't go to the gym as much as I would like, but I'm still impressed with how long these sneakers held up.  I feel like they're super comfortable, they're a great quality, and unlike other underarmor sneakers I've ordered, they're actually true to size.

Personally, I prefer pumas.  I feel that they just have better support and last longer.  That being said, even as a puma enthusiast, I would probably buy these sneakers again because I know they're dependable and get the job done."
UA,4,"I dropped the stars on these because the trim color appeared to be a teal color but came into white. I’m okay with white, but the photo is off. My fault for not reading the description better. Regardless, they’re awesome shoes"
UA,4,I gave this shoe a 4 star because I had to buy a 1/2 size larger. I had ordered a 9 previously (from a different seller who was cheaper but also sent the wrong color). I wear 8 1/2 -9. A 9 1/2 fits well... I think other than that it seems to be a great shoe! . I live in Hawaii and rarely wear tennis shoes so I have not given it a lot of time yet... but I will when I go hiking next!
UA,4,I had to exchange for a half size bigger than I normally wear.
UA,4,"I have been having trouble with bunions and needed a wider fit and this shoe came in wide. I had tried it on in a normal size in store and it was so comfortable. So, I went on line and found out it came in wide so there was no question I was ordering it.  I had to wait about three weeks before I saw my size available but it was worth it. 8 Wide and I didn't even have to buy the men's like I was considering. For me I have feet issues and need a bit more support so I will put my needed support insoles eventually in these shoes. But that is me, I like the price, style, color and I wear them almost daily playing pickleball. So, they get a workout. Buy them. You won't be sorry. The insole is good for a normal person. I am abnormal. Only footwise I think 🙄😏"
UA,4,I have feet issues and Under Armour shoes give me the support I need. This most recent pair seems to be losing its support quicker than previous pairs of AR’s.
UA,4,I have had my kids in Under Armor for 10 years figured I’d try a pair. I usually wear 9 in all other type shoes and 9.5 in sneakers. These fit perfect. Super supportive and beautiful. I was a bit shocked they were light gray. I thought they were white. Still super cute though.
UA,4,"I haven't worn them a ton, but so far, I like them. They're comfortable and have made running, jumping rope and even burpees easier for me because of how comfortable they are and the support the sole provides. The only thing they need is a bit more arch support."
UA,4,I like the looks of the shoe. It's a bit heavy and rigid. Has great support. Looks cool. But not a shoe I will work out in. Looks cute w jeans.
UA,4,I like the shoes but they are not comfortable for walking extended periods. I am a nurse and won't  be wearing them for work.
UA,4,I like the way they fit. But it wasn’t the color I ordered.
UA,4,I love it
UA,4,I love the color - bright & energetic looking.  They are comfy to walk in for a long period of time. I have not tried to exercise in them yet but for walking they are good
UA,4,"I love the shoe,  but as soon as I took them out of the box, there were 2 grease like Stains on the side on the L one. Totally bummed because the shoes are sharp."
UA,4,"I love the shoes but there not a true 9 us inless your not supposed to wear socks with them and even barefoot there too tight. Im hoping theyll strech over time. Or not sure if i should return them. I bought another pair of tennis shoes at the same time size 9 us and they fit perfectly. There a diffrent brand.
I had planned to use the for walking and fitness. I 2as a little concerned when i seen the box it was shredded as you can see but the shoes were ok."
UA,4,I love the support and the look of this show. This is my fourth pair of under armour shoes. I'm on my feet most of the day and walk a large dog before and after work. I'm super happy with these shoes.
UA,4,"I love these shoes. They look great and feel great, other than my left foot is a little tight. My left foot is slightly bigger than my right, so the big toe on my left foot touches the tip of the shoe. Other than that I love them."
UA,4,I loved my Under Armour Dash2s  so I ordered another pair of Under Armours.  These are not as comfortable as my Dash2s. They are a lot harder on the soles.  Otherwise they are ok.
UA,4,"I ordered a half size up per other reviews. I think I could have ordered my regular size and been fine. Fit would have been snug, where as the half size up is a little looser around my toes. I use them for running and have had no issues, it could use a little more cushion on the sole but overall it’s comfortable."
UA,4,I ordered an 8.5 (I normally wear an 8) and it was still too small.
UA,4,I ordered the black with white logo and I got black on black but it’s fine .  Great shoe for those who walk a lot
UA,4,I should have listened to the other reviews. These sneakers do run small. I’m an 8.5W and it isn’t long enough. Plus the back of the shoe keeps rubbing into my ankles. I’ve bought 8.5W from Under Armor before and they fit perfectly.
UA,4,"I swear by Under Armor sneakers because I have flat feet and they seem to fit better and their sizes are always consistent, unlike most other brands of sneakers. I run, cycle, walk, hike, etc and these seem to be perfect for this. I love the vivid white color and will probably wear them mostly inside for spinning to chow them off, these shoes are too pretty to get dirty!
Good support. The sides are a little stiff but to be expected for new out of the box shoes and will become more flexible with wear. Just got them today and wearing around the house now. I will provide an updated review if this is off after more wear. So far very happy with the purchase!"
UA,4,"I use them for walking the dog, playing shuffleboard which I like for the support of foot and ankles.. They are light weight. I did, as always with tennis shoes, order a 1/2 size larger. They fit very well."
UA,4,I was concerned after reading the reviews about the quality and sizing for this sneaker! But the feel great and supportive!! And for sizing I’m a women’s size 9 in shoes but I usually run a size 8- 8 1/2 on heels or sneakers!! I saw that they run a bit snug so I was conflicted on sizing down of not as I usually do with sneakers!!! I’m gald I didn’t!! I ordered a 9 and it was very much true to size! If you have wide feet i would definitely recommend half a size up
UA,4,I was looking for a firmer sole with more suppprt to help with foot pain and that's what I found in these. For the first time in weeks my feet didn't hurt after work. I would've loved a little more cushion or gel insoles and a bit more design though.
UA,4,"I wear an 8.5 in women’s running shoes which normally gives me still some room for my toes but in these UA running sneaker my toes rubs on the edge.
IMO they run small but they seem like they’ll be a comfortable running shoe if I can figure out what size to wear. Will be returning them for a slightly larger pair. Had to send back the 8.5 and ordered a 9 in women’s, the 9 fits much better as now my toes don’t hit the edge inside."
UA,4,I’m only giving this 4 starts because the picture from what I ordered shows a black shoe with white sole. But the description when I go back says black/black. That was misleading. I received an all black shoe. Not what I wanted but I guess it’ll do.
UA,4,"I'm usually a size 10, bought a 10.5 and it feels good. It is a little longer than a shoe normally fits me but I think a size 10 would have been too narrow at the end to fit my big toe. I have narrow feet but my big toe and second toe make my feet a 10 and these shoes become more narrow at the toe bed. They hurt my feet at first but now that I have worn them in, they feel great"
UA,4,"It is softer feel – but not necessarily plush. It is much smoother ride, and because of those two things. It is more responsive. It was more than needed, and because of that, I actually enjoyed running in it on pavement, track, and gravel. It is my first choice for workouts or racing. If you’re looking for one well-rounded stability shoe, this is a good one"
UA,4,It ok and comfortable
UA,4,It runs small. Re order a bigger size. Fit nice. I'm glad the price dropped. I needed it badly. Glad to find this one. I love the colors. I hope to continue those colors.
UA,4,"It's difficult to find a US Size 10.5. They fit comfortably with no issues right out of the box.  The only thing that's a little disappointing is that they don't clean up easily. I got the light gray and orange for the summer and my daughter stepped on one of them with her cleats.  The mesh over the top of the toe keeps you from cleaning the underlying fabric. Other than that, they are great."
UA,4,"I've always worn a 6.5 but these are a little short. They are not narrow, which helps. I walk over 3 miles every day, and they are a comfortable shoe."
UA,4,Just a heads up: pay attention when ordering the black and white because picture is of black with white soles but it’s easy to miss the label saying black with black soles. I had to return and order the ones I really wanted. Even though returns are simple it’s still a bit of a hassle.
UA,4,Like the color combination.... nothing to dislike
UA,4,"Like the shoe, but the inserts are flat and glued to the shoe. I'm flat footed and wear custom inserts to alleviate foot pain, so am dissapointed with these shoes. Guess I won't be running with these and only wearing them for short amount of time."
UA,4,"Likes:
Shoe is a good quality at a fair price.
 Dislike: It feels a little snug on the top of your foot.
And footbed is a little harder than I expected."
UA,4,Love almost everything about this shoe. I personally like more support but I'd buy it again.
UA,4,Love the comfort and look
UA,4,Love the fit but the back of one shoe is evenly stiff on my ankle.  This may soften up over time.
UA,4,"Love the shoes, but fit a bit small and now i have rub scabs on the back of my heels. Ordered the size i normally wear in all other shoes, including UA bought from kohls, which names me wonder if these are knock offs. Idk."
UA,4,Love the shoes. But the delivery driver ran my sons powerwheels over and broke it.
UA,4,"Love the way felt on my feet.  I wore them all day for the first time ever wearing them, and they did not bother me at all.  Would definitely buy more colors!"
UA,4,Love the way they fit!
UA,4,Love them
UA,4,Love these super comfy and don’t make my feet hurt after hours of wearing
UA,4,"Lovely shoes overall... fit is tight... I'm usually a 7.5 so got the 8 but it was almost too small, so suggest buying a size higher than your usual size..."
UA,4,Mis zapatos aún no tienen cinco meses y tal como se ve en la foto ya se rompió de un lado
UA,4,Nice and comfortable. Gives support during my workouts
UA,4,Nice looking shoe. Very comfortable and true to size.
UA,4,Not my favorite shoe. They are ok but I prefer Adidas.
UA,4,"Photo shows teal,  description reads black and white... be careful"
UA,4,"Pros:
-Decently wide toe box! I tend to find a lot of sneakers uncomfortable on my pinky toes, but these do well.
-Really nice looking
-Comfortable insole
-Lightweight

Cons:
I wore these today with some low-cut no-show socks, and the upper of one shoe in particular, near the tongue, was scratching me. I’ll need to wear them with fuller-coverage socks. (I also tried them with no-shows that go all the way to my ankles, rendering them not-quite-no-shows, and that worked well.)"
UA,4,Quality shoe. Great company
UA,4,Que la foto se ve negro con blanco pero cuando lo hordenas sale todo negro pero todo bien
UA,4,Run a bit small
UA,4,Running
UA,4,Runs a full size small
UA,4,Runs a little small
UA,4,Runs small.
UA,4,Shoe fit well and is comfortable. A good shoe for the cost.
UA,4,Shoe seemed to run small compared to other UA shoes I have. Waiting to hear when 7.5 is in stock
UA,4,"Shoe seems to be a bit small, but can still be used."
UA,4,Shoes were a little too small but other than that they were light weight.
UA,4,Shoes were fine and other things I have ordered. Very disappointed that your company waited until inauguration to offer help with vaccine. Will think twice before ordering from your company again.
UA,4,"Sleek and stylish tennis shoes. I loved the jet black and white Under Armour logo that is signature to the brand. The shoes seemed to be well constructed and lightweight. My main complaint is that the shoes run very narrow. I could not comfortably wear them and therefore could not test them out to run in. For anyone with slightly wider feet, these are not for you. But if you do not have wide feet, these are super lightweight and stylish and decently priced as of the date of this review at $55.91 and would make a great running shoe."
UA,4,So happy with this purchase. I was looking for all black sneakers and found these and right away wanted it. Fit nice and feels comfortable
UA,4,"Soft and nice sneakers
They feel just a bit small, hope that when I’m using them they’ll give in"
UA,4,Son cómodos
UA,4,Super comfy. However- the color is truly neon orange...not even close to pink./peach. Got them for a great price.
UA,4,The box seems faded and old. Was torn on the sides but shoes weren't damaged. I'm pretty picky about my shoes. These are really good looking shoes. Thought the white rubber part might look too funky but all blends together nicely. I'm happy.
UA,4,The fit is perfect and very comfortable
UA,4,"The product look nice when it arrived new to my home, and Amazon deliver was fast! I brought it in Nov 2019 and wear it for walking and sometimes running. I would say I did not use it really intense but I wear it most of the days even just walk to school and sit in the library for a whole day. The size fit as normal for me but it definitely became bigger after a while of wearing it (just normal as what other shoes will do). Over all, it is a nice shoes and water will get into it if it rains hard. However, 10month later, both of the shoes has wear and and tear located in where my back heel is, and it is not really comfortable as the hard supported stuff on the back heel comes up with no fabric to cover it. It is overall nice one, but with the price and brand I would expect something more durable for running and wear it on a daily basis. NOT SURE how other running shoes will do but if you plan to wear it for sports activities for more than a year, maybe this is not a good choice here. At least the one I got!"
UA,4,"The shoe fits well and is very comfortable. My only complaint is that there is little to no arch support so when worn for long period of time, it begins to hurt my feet."
UA,4,"The shoe is comfortable. It looks nice, but the  picture when ordered showed a black shoe with white edging on the bottom. This shoe is a black shoe with a black bottom edge. Pay close attention to the wording and not the picture when ordering."
UA,4,The shoes are ok I have plantars fasciitis and they do not have Orthopedic insoles so a little disappointed and the product not supporting
UA,4,"The size of the 👞shoes are slightly small, Under Amour"
UA,4,These are a great find.  They fit well and I work on my feet all day and they have enough cushion that my feet don't hurt.  They seem to have a lot of good support too
UA,4,These are so cute but I believe the size it just off a bit. If I wear these on a hike. My toes cramp up for days later. I would go up in a half size if they have it.
UA,4,"These are so cute! They’re my first pair of UA’s. I’m typically a huge fan of New Balance (regular width). The sole has great cushioning & is quite comfortable. The blue UA insignia and the stripe along the bottom of the shoe are different shades of blue (I took off a star for it). This bugged me at first, but I got over it. Unfortunately, these were too narrow & tight. I returned these & bought them in wide width & they fit great!"
UA,4,"These are the second pair of Under Armor sneakers I’ve owned. The first pair were PERFECT, but these are not. I like the color but they feel and look a bit too large on my feet.  I wore them twice and although I love the style, I am not fond of how they feel on my feet or how they look on my feet (they make my feet look huge)."
UA,4,These are very comfortable. Love under armour shoes
UA,4,"These look great but they’re slightly more narrow than what I usually wear. I’m a size 9, and my toes are hitting the front of the shoe."
UA,4,"These run a little small, but yet they are comfortable.  Nice and breathable material, even in a Texas summer."
UA,4,"These shoes are very comfortable! I have one gripe though. The heel cup goes out very far, it’s much larger then my heel. Makes it a little awkward."
UA,4,"These shoes fit excellent! And are super stylish and comfy. I've had under armor before so I expected them to fit.

The only issue I have with this is the color. When I made the order originally, the default picture for the item is the blue, black & white shoe. I thought I was getting that color scheme (which is what caught my eye in the first place), but when I got the shoes today I noticed they were just the standard black & white. Looking at the shoe options and descriptions, the shoe I picked (with the blue) has a black & white description. So I don't know if the seller needs to update the pictures or descriptions, but you'll probably want to make sure that the photos are accurate. I was slightly disappointed that they weren't the color I wanted but I'm overall satisfied."
UA,4,"These sneakers are great! I buy a lot of sneakers for work, all under armor and as these were the cheapest UA sneakers I ever bought, they work and fell great!"
UA,4,These sneakers are Great! They felt good right out of the box. Walked 3 miles with no issues. Good support and nice looking too!
UA,4,They are great
UA,4,They are really cute but size 1/2 size up. I’m a 7 usually in Nike but the top part of the shoe caught on my left toe (must be the bigger foot) good support and quality is mediocre
UA,4,"They are very comfortable and fit true to size. However, they do not look like female shoes to me."
UA,4,They fit great. I found UA shoes run smaller so I always get a 1/2 size bigger.
UA,4,"They hurt my heels the first time I wore them, but they have been great ever since!"
UA,4,"They were great looking, but they were to small. I sent them back to get a size 7. Can't wait to get the right size."
UA,4,This shoe meets my expectations
UA,4,Under Armor  is my favorite. I like the way they fit and they hive good support.
UA,4,Very comfortable shoes
UA,4,"Very comfortable shoes!  Can wear all day and not have sore feet!  Fit great.  First pair of Under Armor Shoes I have purchased, will buy again!"
UA,4,Wife likes color and style but she complained that her heel hurts opposed too wearing Nike shoes
Adidas,3,"2 issues:
1. the sole cushion stops abruptly around the entire perimeter of the shoe where the sides of your feet & little toes land on a hard seam.
2. The rubber toe stop pushes down on my big toe.
I had high hopes for these but missed the mark!"
Adidas,3,A very cute design but also very uncomfortable- they’re loose  and don’t have much support . Adidas shoes have constantly ran large in my experience. I usually go one size smaller than what I wear in other brands.
Adidas,3,Adorable shoes...until they fell apart.  Got them in January and they were toast by the end of March.
Adidas,3,"Attractive shoe, good support, could have more cushioning."
Adidas,3,Beautiful shoe. Not great for running however as it is sparse on the cushioning
Adidas,3,"Beautiful, comfortable shoes, great for working out,running"
Adidas,3,"Beware:  Buzzfeed sent me here.  These are cute, but not for what they are advertising (running).  Maybe they meant “running” errands, because there’s zero support or cushion for an actual workout.  They’re convenient to slip on in a rush, and wash well in the washing machine, but don’t expect to power walk in these without the tread disappearing in a month.  Let’s call these what they are: glorified house slippers."
Adidas,3,Bien comodos
Adidas,3,Bought for comfort and can tell they are really made cheap.  Hope we get our money’s worth
Adidas,3,Bought these for work (on my feet all day) and they are super comfortable.  I had another pair before and they held up great in the washer many times.
Adidas,3,bought this for work. Its comfortable but the front of the shoes feel like am walking on the ground. Its very flat conlare to the back.
Adidas,3,But she went self is great however my sizing was off and it was more a little less than true to fit on the sizing. I was punished by the seller and not giving my full return back was charged restocking fee.
Adidas,3,But they not so good because when I wear those shoes to my pregnant wife she inform me the shoes shale is too hard and she couldn't wear it as well.
Adidas,3,"Can use for gym workouts/weight training, but need more cushion/support for running"
Adidas,3,"Cheap looking, fabric very thin but it’s ok"
Adidas,3,"Color different from picture,but fit is true to size"
Adidas,3,Color was off a little eggshell color not white white
Adidas,3,"Comfortable and durable, but feet still hurt after standing for long periods of time. Shoe laces constantly coming untied!"
Adidas,3,"Comfortable and lightweight. Lovely neutral color (white). The top part gapes around the ankle, so I returned them."
Adidas,3,"Comfortable and look good  but they run 1/2 big, not true to size. Tried getting correct size but the company wants more money..all different prices for the same sneaker doesn't make sense."
Adidas,3,Comfortable but my old feet need more arch support.
Adidas,3,Comfortable but super hard to get on
Adidas,3,Comfortable shoes but within the first week of wearing them the 3 dashes on the side that make up the adidas symbol started peeling off. On one of my shoes they were half peeled off by the end of the first week I wore them and the other shoe is peeling as well but not as bad.
Adidas,3,"Comfortable, but too narrow. Returned."
Adidas,3,comfortable.  very lightweight but absolutely no support. Don't buy for walking or anything other than lounging or maybe yoga.
Adidas,3,"Comfortable/loose fit except for the shoe tongue (part that covers the top of the shoe) which is a bit stiff and chafes the front of my ankle when I walk.  Hoping that with use it will feel more comfortable, but should have returned it."
Adidas,3,Comfortable; they're cute but fake. There's glue in some spots.
Adidas,3,Comfy and cute but way bigger than expected so I’m pretty disappointed
Adidas,3,Comfy stylish shoe but tread appears like it will wear quickly! Returned!
Adidas,3,"Comfy, Cute, and reasonably priced."
Adidas,3,Cómodos para mis pies.
Adidas,3,"Cut shoe, but I had to return due to size. The tongue is attached to the shoe making it difficult to slide my foot in. Order up a half size if you’ve got a wider foot."
Adidas,3,Cute and fine for running errands. Not even supportive enough to walk the dog let alone working out.
Adidas,3,Cute shoe but kills my feet after a few hours of wearing them.
Adidas,3,Cute shoe but no cushion.
Adidas,3,Cute shoe but they are very tight. I have a small narrow foot and wear a woman’s size 4 1/2. I got a size 5 and I can barely stuff my foot in this shoe. Hopefully they will stretch some.
Adidas,3,"Cute, but an odd fit if you have an average yet slightly narrow foot."
Adidas,3,"Did not expect 😳 to find a broken box with a rubber ban around it, no tissue paper. Bad presentation for the price."
Adidas,3,Did not fit like the other pairs that I have!
Adidas,3,Difficult to put on!
Adidas,3,"Disappoint with the brand
Way too tight ,made for real narrow feet."
Adidas,3,Disappointed. I should have read the reviews. These are slipon's... the shoestrings are for show.  I have wide feet and there's no way to get them on
Adidas,3,"Even though there are laces that tie, these are basically slip-on shoes. And the laces are far too long."
Adidas,3,Favorite shoes working 12 hr or more shifts!
Adidas,3,"Feels like cardboard not a cloud. I only wear for a few hours at a time, not sure how they'd feel if you have to wear them all day.  Looser fit width wise so it feels like my foot slides around a bit.  Use them for dancing so the flexibility of the sole is good."
Adidas,3,Feels super light nice and confy
Adidas,3,"First off, I will say these shoes are cute and easy to slip on/off, and run a little on the large size. I wear an 8 and bought the same, but I've got a lot of room in the toe box. However, outside of those observations, I'm not entirely sure what Adidas intended on these shoes being worn for. I can't wear them to run because they have absolutely no arch support, they're too soft compared to elite running shoes, and the shoelaces are merely decorative; if I ran in them, they'd most likely slide up and down my heel. I also couldn't wear them to do any kind of lower body weightlifting (squats, deadlifts, any oly lifts, etc.) because despite the shoes being flat and having no support, the sole and insert are very cushioned. I guess if you want a cute pair of shoes to wear to Target or while walking your dog, these are your kicks, but they're absolutely useless in the gym."
Adidas,3,Fit kinda funny. Not super comfortable. Returned them.
Adidas,3,Fit narrow through the toe. Not her comfortable.
Adidas,3,"Fit well, wide width, I felt like the sole was thin. I could feel every uneven surface through the shoe. They were 35$ so you can’t expect much."
Adidas,3,"Fits slightly big. If I didn’t get these on Amazon and i had to put in some work to return them, I wouldn’t have purchased them. I’m not picky about shoes at all but these are not comfortable."
Adidas,3,"For $60 shoes, this material and construction seem very cheap, like something you'd find at Payless. You can see raw seams inside the shoe, and the sole is oddly light and stiff, with tough padding under your foot. I haven't worn them out yet, so I can't say how well they'd treat my joints in the long run. But overall the shoes fit pretty comfortably and look the part, though I wouldn't consider them exceptional by any means. Still debating whether to return."
Adidas,3,Gift
Adidas,3,Gives me sores on the back of my ankles
Adidas,3,Good fit and they look good. But the cloudfoam used does not compare to others. The bottoms are very thin and hurt my arches.
Adidas,3,Good fit but the shoestring is too tight across the instep.
Adidas,3,"Good looking shoe. The cloud foam cushion it came with took me about five minutes to dislike because your toes roll over the edges and that’s soooo annoying. But determined to want to keep them because they are attractive and slip on (I wanted them for a work from home house shoe.) I put a pair of Dr. Scholls in soles inside them. They’d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you ... it worked splendidly!! I now LOVE these shoes. They are like walking on marshmallows. True to size. Attractive. Super comfy. Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole. Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning. I’d say if you’re looking for a “house slipper” quality shoe ... this is it. Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great. Without the insoles, I would have had to return them."
Adidas,3,Good looking shoes but sadly not for sports like tennis or basketball where there is a lot of pivoting and foot movement. It is eroding at the front after under 3 months. After one tennis session the front started depleting. I cannot recommend. Only for fashion in my opinion.
Adidas,3,Good quality just too big
Adidas,3,"Good quality, but I’d recommend buying half size bigger."
Adidas,3,Good support but the tongue rubs my ankle so weird if you wear no show socks.
Adidas,3,"Good to walk in, but these get dirty SO easy and they are cheap feeling. Not worth what they cost."
Adidas,3,Got them a few months ago in white wanted another color. Super comfortable
Adidas,3,"Great Adidas shoe, super lightweight and practical - however not a running shoe. Theres not enough support for the ball or arch of the foot and they fly knit material lacks the sturdiness that would support the movement and impact the feet experience in running. I wear these for work, I'm a personal trainer and I am on my feet 10-14 hours a day - this is the second pair of these shoes that I have purchased, I walked the bottoms of the first pair almost completely smooth in less than 6 months. These new ones, having had them barely a month are already starting to wear to smooth on the bottom."
Adidas,3,Great fit very comfortable and stylish.
Adidas,3,Great for walking not for running
Adidas,3,"great product, will buy again"
Adidas,3,"Hmm, I'm no expert but I'm going to go out on a limb and say these are possibly (probably?) knockoffs. First pair I received had one irregular shoe. Everything about it was askew,  and the lining in the toe wasn't sewn down. Exchanged them (quickly!) and had slightly the same problem. Out of 4 shoes (2 left, 2 right) I had to choose the 2 that matched the best. None of them looked exactly like another. I'm going to keep them because they are cute and comfy and the price was right. They really just have to last as long as a pair of Target tennis shoes since that's about how much I paid. Not sure I would recommend the purchase, though."
Adidas,3,"Honestly it’s just not what i was looking for. My size is an 8 but they were too big, i think a 7.5 would’ve been better. I also didn’t really find it comfortable, maybe if you know more about running shoes you might find it perfect."
Adidas,3,I already have this color. I ordered the all black ones but they sent me the black and white. Keeping then because they are comfortable and cheap and it doesn't hurt to have 2 in this color since they match with everything.
Adidas,3,"I am a size 8, I got an 8.5 just in case they ran small & they did! Could barely put my foot inside. I wore once and they killed my feet. Cute shoes though.... just took small, tight & no support at all."
Adidas,3,"I am not a runner, but I can't imagine this shoe lasting through training for a 1/2 marathon or even a 5k. Not that much cushion or arch support for more than casual walking.  Ok for running errands but that's about it."
Adidas,3,"I am not completely happy with these, they are a sloppy fit different material then when I tried a pair on in the store, would not purchase again"
Adidas,3,"I am usually a 9.5 as most shoes don’t come in Wide. These were comfortable, but way too big. A good shoe I’m sure l, but not for my feet."
Adidas,3,I bought it for my mom. It looks nice & soft but the tongue comes up to high & cuts her leg
Adidas,3,"I bought these after my sister bought a pair and raved about them, but for my narrow  feet  they are just too roomy.  They are very padded in the sole and nice and wide for a wide foot but they just didn’t work out for me."
Adidas,3,"I bought these as a running shoe, but they're not very supportive. My ankles hurt after running a mile. They're super cute and comfortable as a casual everyday shoe, but not great for actually running."
Adidas,3,"I bought these for running. While they felt comfy when I first put them on, these are not for running. The bottom tread is already wearing after a month, and they provide zero support."
Adidas,3,"I bought these hoping they would fit like the last pair of Adidas shoes I got. I was really disappointed. My main issue was the toe box was too narrow. Also, these didn't have as much cushion as I had hoped for. I do get compliments on the looks when I wear them, however, I can't wear them if I'm going to be on my feet much."
Adidas,3,"I bought these sneakers based on reviews and price. First, I will say that they are cute and comfy on the inside. Other than that, I'm not a fan. I think that they run big, I have worn an 8 1/2 Nike sneaker forever and that's what I ordered. They were too big, stupid of me for keeping them! I also feel that they may run a little wide so if you have wide feet these may be for you. They are comfortable inside but offer no support. Lastly, they were very stiff on the top (the area that would be the tongue). They rubbed on the top of my foot and made it sore for about 2 weeks until they were broke in. I still wear them for work but don't think I would buy them again."
Adidas,3,"I bought this solely for use in the gym.  This is not a running shoe in any way shape or form...even the cheapest running shoes have an arch support and aren't supported by a thin layer of memory foam. Shoe is a bit wide.
I have an insert to provide support for my heel. I have a low arch, but there is no support at all in this shoe, compared to any ""real"" athletic shoe."
Adidas,3,"I consider these “fashion shoes”. Just like you shouldn’t wear heels to the gym, you shouldn’t wear these for any athletic purpose. The laces don’t close the shoes up properly, and the tongue of the shoes is integrated with the entire shoe - so you get a weird accordion effect after tying them. There is zero arch support, but the memory foam insole is comfy.

Would I wear these to take social media-worthy pictures of myself? Absolutely. Would I wear these to take a 2 mile fitness walk in my neighborhood? Well, I did - and injured my foot, pulling a tendon and forcing me to wear an ankle brace for 3 weeks.

When it comes to workout gear, these shoes are not a good look."
Adidas,3,"I didn't realize the laces were ""fake""
Not as much cushion as I thought. I ended up returning this product."
Adidas,3,I do love the shoe however there is hardly any cushioning inside the shoe so running or walking for long periods tends to leave your feet sore.
Adidas,3,I don't know if they usually fit big but these slipped on my heel and were too long.
Adidas,3,I got paranoid at first cause last night it said delivered when it hadn't but today it showed up. Put them on right away. They were kind of hard to put on and the top of my feet feel like there choking. There my size but I'm guessing it's the style of shoe.... idk. I love them but I'm debating about getting a size bigger.
Adidas,3,"I got these on sale on Prime Day. They're comfortable enough. They have absolutely no arch support. Definitely don't wear them out in the rain, your feet will get soaked in the first two seconds which is what the picture there is for. It doesn't say anything about being water proof, just thought that was some useful information."
Adidas,3,"I got these when they were on sale for $35 on amazon. I normally wear a size 7 and that is what I got with this shoe and it fit properly.  They are lightweight and comfortable. I rarely run...I am a walker. I walk on sidewalk and asphalt and the soles on these shoes are worn out after barely 3 months. The ""cloud foam"" is  not dense enough to last long at all. I do occasionally jog for about 1 out of 4 miles, but mostly just walk fast. There's already a hole.in the toe of the sole. For $35, okay...I'd say go for it, but now they're up to over $50. No way. I'd have to buy minimum 4 pair a year."
Adidas,3,I had to add support.
Adidas,3,I have a feeling these shoes are knock-offs but not positive. Adidas stripes only on outside of shoe. My sister has similar shoe and stripes are on both sides plus her have adidas embedded in side of soles. They are a little big. I do like the style and the light weight - very comfy.
Adidas,3,I have bought several pairs of these but different colors something about this pair was off they did not fit like the others they was to tight and hard to get on. I love all my others just not happy with this pair
Adidas,3,I have had these shoes for 2 months. I have worn them less than 20 times for normal wear. The thread that goes across the top midfoot is coming loose. Very disapointing. Otherwise fairly comfortable shoe for daily use. I wouldnt recommend walking long distances.
Adidas,3,"I have really mixed feelings. I like them, they’re comfy. Kind of feel like supported bare feet. So not a whole lot of support, but I can still wear them all day on concrete and not want to die.

The sizing is way off. I returned my regular size for a full size down and now (2-3 months later) I feel like I could have gone down another full size.

The support is ok. And their insole in sewn in so you can’t easily add your own.

I love the slip on function and they are my second most grabbed for shoe."
Adidas,3,"I have several other pair of Adidas running shoes, these by far have the least amount of support. Not sure who came up with the marketing strategy to call them ""Cloudfoam"" but this isn't what I would expect if I were walking on clouds. They're fine for day to day running errands, but that's about it. They're not uncomfortable by any means, and there was no ""breaking them in"" period. But I'm definitely not running a marathon in them and there are way better options (including by Adidas).  Okay for the day, they were less expensive on Amazon than in stores, so I'm okay with that, but if I had paid actual retail price, they would have gone back."
Adidas,3,"I have several pairs of these shoes and this pair is 1/2 size larger than the others. Plus, not nearly the support as the others have. I waited too long to return them, the window is closed for me. Not happy with this purchase. :("
Adidas,3,"I have this shoe in white, loved them so much I got them in black so I could have a pair for work"
Adidas,3,"I have two other pair of these shoes so I ordered the same size as before (size 7 ladies)  This new pair is a bit smaller and a bit more snug.  What I don't like it the worthless shoe lace.  It serves no purpose other than it prevents the slip-on, slip off.  Nothing laces up so the shoe lace is merely a decoration.  The lace is too long and just flops.  around.  I have to double tie the know to keep it from walking on it."
Adidas,3,"I have two other pairs of these shoes, but for some reason the opening with this pair is really small. I hope they stretch with use.  If you have a high instep or a wide foot, you may need to purchase a bigger size or skip them all together."
Adidas,3,"I like that this is a shoe I wouldn't have trouble removing and wearing at airport checkpoint counters! Durable, lightweight, classy style, and A Slip-On!"
Adidas,3,"I like the look of these shoes, but runs small, so too small and tight on top of foot. I wish I could exchange"
Adidas,3,I like the shoe however I have tripped while walking every single time I wear these shoes. I’m a 42 year old healthy mom of 2 young active kids and I can’t be tripping all the time so unfortunately I won’t wear these shoes again. It just seems the bottom catches on the floor somehow. Have never had this problem with any other shoe.
Adidas,3,"I like them, but they are too late. Size .5 down."
Adidas,3,I like these sneakers and they're very comfortable but they feel like I have on thick socks instead of sneakers. Just weird to me.
Adidas,3,I liked the color but the shoe seem to fit loose & I didn’t like how the tongue of shoe doesn’t lay flat & ended up rubbing my leg so they were returned.
Adidas,3,I liked the look & the comfort of this shoe however they do run a little big.  I did not like how tall the tongue of the shoe was.  I decided to return them because it was rubbing up against my ankle as I walked.
Adidas,3,"I love Adidas but this shoe was a huge disappointment it's not soft, not comfortable at all."
Adidas,3,I love how comfortable these shoes are but I ordered ones that looked white in the picture but when it came it was a blue-ish white.
Adidas,3,I love how it fits but unfortunately it's not memory foam on the bottom of feet. Not enough support for weight. I guess the term cloud here is light weight and breathable which I like. Not good for long walks or running.
Adidas,3,"I love how the shoe looks and will wear these with athleisure looks.  But!!  I don't recommend purchasing them specifically for running.  The sole is super thin to the point that you can feel rocks/cracks through the sole.  There's minimum support; you might as well be running bare footed.  To be honest, I shouldn't have expected much for a $35 running shoe … that's on me.  But they're cute at a good price.  ;)"
Adidas,3,"I love how these shoes fit me. They are very comfortable and pretty. They look good with leggings or even jeans. But I was looking for an everyday shoes and unfortunately, these shoes will not last for too long. I've had them for about 3 months and I've used them at least 5 days a week. I have washed them several times but they are stained in the front. But overall, great shoes. Just take care of it, dont use it everyday, and it will probably last you a while."
Adidas,3,"I love the look of this shoe. However, there is minimal support."
Adidas,3,I love the shoes and overall style but way too big. I never return items and had to return these because they were almost a size too big. Will be reordering in the correct size.
Adidas,3,"I love the style of this shoe and that it just slips on. However, they are not as comfortable as I thought they would be. That is why I rated them 3 stars."
Adidas,3,I love the style of this shoe but had to return it. The material is slightly more rigid than the other styles of this type of shoe.
Adidas,3,"I love them, however my foot is wide and it fits a little to narrow.. unfortunately I will be returning them.."
Adidas,3,I love these shoes and this is the second pair of this color and have two black pairs.. They are great and super great that they can go in washer then just set out to dry.. The bast shoe for walking and working out and just comfortable all day long!
Adidas,3,"I love these shoes but they're overpriced on here and you have to get a size bigger than you usually wear. But they're nice looking and comfortable, definitely not running shoes though."
Adidas,3,"I love these shoes, they incredibly comfortable and easy on/off. I have had them for about 2 months and have washed them twice and air dried and the sole is already coming away from the fabric on one of the shoes 😓"
Adidas,3,"I love these shoes, when I bought them in person. Because of this I thought buying them online would be the same way. I'm sure they would have been a amazing product but I got a US size 6 when I ordered a US 8. Luckily I'm getting my refund hopefully soon but I won't buy these again, not because the product is bad but I spent the same amount of the product on shipping to and from. Unfortunate because I really did like this style of shoe :("
Adidas,3,"I might have liked these shoes, but actually never even tried them on as soon as I realized that someone else had worn and then returned the shoes. Quite easy to tell that they had been used as the white-sole, bottom of the sneaker was dirty. I returned them immediately."
Adidas,3,"I need a ten wide and an 11 cannot be a substitute.  They have a high cuteness factor. (I cannot rate these thought)

  And the only reason I am giving it a three star is the way they are made inside. There is bunching of material, a material that extra log and bothered my foot. And inside is made of propalene .  That would be sweaty."
Adidas,3,I need more support.  Very lite weight but I need a therapeutic shoe. So for me comfort was very low.
Adidas,3,"I never write a review... until now. I just got these Adidas Cloudfoam Pure shoes and they are definitely too small! I wear a standard 7.5 and my toes are all at the top of the shoe. Maybe because of the soft woven fabric and low profile toe trim, it isn’t as noticeable to folks and they think the size is alright. In ANY OTHER athletic shoe or sneaker such as this pair, it would be painful. Not to mention wear out the woven material at my toe are very quickly if I kept them and wore them. I will return them and consider a half-size up; the lack of any arch support whatsoever may be a deal breaker for me between my knees and feet.

I can say that the comfort of the woven portion around your foot is extremely comfortable. Just what I was looking for in a quick slip on sneaker to head on light errands or a very light walk with the dogs in the neighborhood. Pay attention when you order them - they are not intended to be anything more than that... they are not for running or taking out on the trail even for a light day hike!!!

Three stars for comfort and being a lightweight shoe built for light duty (I’d do a 2.5, but don’t have that option). It’ll never get the other two stars due to sizing and lack of arch support... Come on Adidas - you can do much better!

PROS:

• Wide array of color options
• Comfortable woven material on top
• Lightweight
• Cushy foam sole

CONS:

• Runs 1/2 size too small
• No arch support whatsoever
• Lightweight foam won’t last very long"
Adidas,3,"I normally wear a 7.5. I could easily have gotten in  a 7. And they loosen up the more I wear them. Very comfy, will probably order another pair in a different color half a size down."
Adidas,3,I ordered 1/2 size larger in this shoe as that is what I always do with my workout shoes...I could not even get my foot into the shoe...maybe it's because you cannot unlace it. Returned
Adidas,3,"I ordered color ""Grey Mãtallique Blanc Craie Corail VIF"".
They look pretty, not too bulky. I love that they are slip-ons, but have laces. They are really nice and lightweight, BUT
The major BUT is that they are really NARROW and snug.
I have a normal width of my feet. Never had a width problem and never ordered wide shoes, but these puppies are way too narrow. The sole itself is narrow, so when I put my foot inside - the sides of my foot were swelling out over the sole. The snickers are also kinda snug. I wear size 8, and it was at least 1/2 size big lengthwise, but still I could hardly fit my foot inside because of the width problem."
Adidas,3,I ordered my usual size. The fit is rather loose. I am worried that they will cause me to trip. I am sending these back.
Adidas,3,"I ordered size 8, and I have chosen to return them because they are too wide. The color is true to photo, great adidas quality."
Adidas,3,"I ordered the Mauve these are definitely not Mauve they are light purple /lavender color, not made for wide feet. I sized down a half size bc I tried some on in the store similar. I should have got the 10 and not the 9.5, I can't give them a five star review bc my feet already hurt putting them on. I even changed to the thinnest socks I own. They are beautiful even though it's not the color not at all in the pink family. Make sure you are not wide footed buying these."
Adidas,3,I ordered these in a 8 1/2. All my shoes are 8 1/2. When they came they were HUGE. They said they were 8 1/2 but after measuring they were a 10 1/2 . Was also told by numerous people they were knock off adidas.
Adidas,3,"I own about a dozen pair of Adidas shoes. I'm a true size 7 in women's and a size 5.5 in men's and youth. I saw this pair in my size on sale at Amazon warehouse and quickly ordered it. Unfortunately, I returned them after using them just one time.

If judging on looks alone, I'd rate it a 5/5 for the bright colors and casual style. Comfort drops it down to 1/5 though. Even though I got my usual size, this pair is VERY tight. It was a struggle slipping it on with or without socks. The length is probably true to size but the width is for very narrow feet. Exacerbating the problem is the stitching that goes across the front of the shoes, just below the laces. The stitching absolutely has no give and kept rubbing against my feet. I wore this to work and by the 6th hour, I was limping because both my feet HURT. Even in the pictures, you can see that the part with the stitches dips in and makes the shoes narrower in that area. My feet were red and swollen by the time I took off the shoes. Knowing how uncomfortable they were, I wasn't willing to keep them.

These are also walking shoes so if you're looking for support for plantar fascitis, this pair is not for you. With how narrow they are, one would probably have to size up at least one full size to be able to fit both inserts and your foot in."
Adidas,3,I personally think it fits smaller by a half size. I have had it for one and a half years and wore it to jog at least twice a week and the right show completely wore out (the black spot in the photo is a HOLE). I got them for 55 dollars and I think they should be more durable.
Adidas,3,"I purchased based on the title ""running shoe"" but this is definitely more a walking shoe. The foam sole was comfortable but did not seem durable, and most of the cushioning was in the heel. I might recommend as a comfortable walking shoe but returned as it did not suit my needs."
Adidas,3,"I purchased them thinking they would be perfect for my Kick Boxing classes. However, they have no support whatsoever so I won’t be able to use them for any type of exercise. I’ve been using them to run errands or whenever I want to pull off a relaxed vibe."
Adidas,3,"I purchased these shoes thinking they were going to be sturdy, in all reality, they are great for walking around the store in but not outside running or jogging, certainly not in the gym on a treadmill. the shoe is flimsy and doesn't truly provide much support. If I could I would invest my money in another shoe, maybe the same brand just something more durable for the price, ya know?"
Adidas,3,"I purchased this shoe after reading an article regarding its rating as the #1 most comfortable running shoe on Amazon. I have wide feet that have become sensitive to ""rubbing"" around the widest parts of my feet.  These shoes were irritating to those places on my feet, and I quite simply did not want to invest the time and blisters to see if it they would get more comfortable with time.
If you have wide feet, this might not be the shoe for you."
Adidas,3,I really like these shoes. They are comfortable for the most part. The length size fits nicely but they are a little narrow.
Adidas,3,I really like these sneakers because it feels like one with my body!! It fits like a glove!! And I feel like I’m walking on a cloud
Adidas,3,I really liked it and I used this for walking and for workout
Adidas,3,I really liked the style and the color of the shoes and how lightweight they are.  They don’t really have great support or cushion in the sole though.
Adidas,3,I really loved the way these looked and if they were just for running errands I would have kept them. I returned them because the support was not what I needed and the cushion was to be desired.
Adidas,3,"I really loved wearing these shoes- they are comfortable and the kind where you don’t have to untie/retie, you can just slide them on and off. The only problem I found was that after about 2.5 months, the tread is almost completely worn down, to the point where one shoe even has a little hole so my socks get soaked if there is any water at all on the ground. For reference, I wear these everyday to walk my dog, 2.5-3 miles per day. I wish they had lasted longer because they are super comfortable."
Adidas,3,I really wanted these shoes. Ordered my size but they run 1/2 size too big.
Adidas,3,I received a ton of compliments on how the shoe looks but the sole is not very sturdy and they are somewhat difficult to move in.  I attempted to run and play volleyball in them and was unsuccessful.
Adidas,3,I received my shoes earlier than expected. The color was perfect. Very comfortable a little wider than I expected in the box area. Perfect when I wear socks. Very pleased with my purchase.
Adidas,3,"I should of gotten half of size small. Usually wear 9.5  and when I pu them on i noticed all the space i had in the front. thin  fabric, comfortable but doesn't  have much support if your looking for something that will help with back or kneee pain. This is not the sneakers for you."
Adidas,3,"I stand all day for work and my feet hurt so bad. Looking for shoes that have support and some cushioning. These were really soft under my feet and felt great when I tried them on and took a few steps (compared to my old shoes I was wearing). But wearing them to work, my feet still hurt all the time and the cushioning doesnt help for more than 20 minutes. These are nice for walking around a store but not for hours at a time. I've gotten compliments on them but I'm disappointed."
Adidas,3,i still feel these are not authentic addidas. i wear a 10 those didnt fit and felt off on my foot so i sized up on the second pair still dont fit right and i feel a lump in the arch area. something is off with these shoes. guess im out money on these.. too bad because i like the look of them. what a waste of money..
Adidas,3,I suggest going down a 1/2 size. I normally wear an 8 & these were big. 7 1/2 would have fit better.
Adidas,3,"I suppose I needed to expect a cheap shoe for a cheap shoe... it’s aesthetically pleasing if you’re wearing them to just walk around shopping, etc... works for basic TRX classes (and similar) just don’t get the idea of actually using this shoe to run or do anything that requires significant impact for more than 45 min-hr. I’ll admit I did think it would function more like a trainer (I had it recommended after I was forced to retire my pearl izumi trainers) For reference: I’m 5’4” 118# Do cross training with Pilates reformer, yoga, TRX, 4-5 days a week, alpine ski 55+ days per winter and run 30-80 miles per week. I wouldn’t recommend this show for anything more than a short gym class."
Adidas,3,I thought this shoe was a slip on. Was not. Sent right back.
Adidas,3,"I tried some Adidas cloudfoam shoes prior to this that I fell in love with, it felt like I was walking on clouds, or that I had pillows for my feet or something.

By comparison, the quality of these shoes was lacking. They’re definitely nice to look at it, but feel flimsier and cheaply made. I didn’t get the cloudfoam feel from these that I got from the superstar shoes."
Adidas,3,"I tried these shoes on in White/White/Black at Rack Room Shoes and loved them! I was surprised at how comfortable and wide they were. I also wanted to make sure I knew the exact size I needed so I wouldn’t have to fumble with sending them back. I went on Amazon to see if they were cheaper and if they had any other color choices. I chose the black and white carbon ones that weren’t available in the store. I received them today and tried them on. They are much narrower than the ones in the store and with every step I take, I can feel the stitches on the insole where the side of my foot and toe area are. I love the style and color but am going to have to send them back. I guess I will end up with the grey ones and spend more for them at my local store. I’m sure I just got a bad pair considering I’ve tried them on before. Disappointed"
Adidas,3,I typically wear a 9.5 but only a 10 was available so I went ahead with it and they are almost too small!
Adidas,3,"I usually where a size 9 women's shoe so I ordered 9, and they're too big  It1s not Adidas fault but I wore them once and was walking across a little brick lined plaza I caught the front of my shoe and went flying stumbled hard to my knees and scraped the heck out of my left knee and put a hole in a brand new pair of jeans that I was wearing they(the jeans) didn't for quite right too i was seeing how they did if they stretched  out  wearing them and they did i wanted to return then but don't think I can now because I put a hole in the knee when I tripped wearing these shoes that run big at least for me they did"
Adidas,3,"I wanted to love these shoes! They are comfy and cute. But, way too big! I’m a size 8. I’ve been an 8 since middle school (I’m 30 now) and I’m even STILL a size 8 after pregnancy! I ordered these in an 8, and they are too big. The size predictor tool said I was an 8. I tried these same shoes on in a store, and the 8 fit great. I just wanted a different color so I ordered them from Amazon, but the fit is not the same. I thought I must have mistakenly ordered a men’s size 8 instead of a woman’s, but, nope. I ordered correctly."
Adidas,3,I wanted to love these. I should have gone 1/2 size smaller. I wore them to work and by noon I wanted to just go barefoot. They’re cute but I found them to be terribly uncomfortable.
Adidas,3,"I was about to give these five stars when I realized that the title was ""running shoe"". I wear these to work and to run errands. They look great and are easy to slip on and off, but in no way would I ever run in these.  There's absolutely no support,  which I don't mind just doing errands, but if I'm running,  I want some type of structure. So if they mean running to the bathroom or running into target to do some aisles, then this is a five star ""running"" shoe, but other than that,  no way."
Adidas,3,"I was disappointed by these. Even at their low price point, I found them to be really poorly made for adidas (and in general).
The bottoms have no cushion— after 3 wears I’m nearly at the ground. The fabric is a nice feeling, but stretches out immediately. The top tongue area is weirdly designed, and the laces don’t really do much. I would spend a few extra dollars and get a better quality shoe to last."
Adidas,3,"I was excited to buy these especially when I saw they were on sale! They look so good on but even after a short walk, my arches started to hurt. They even hurt after I took them off for days. I thought I had developed plantar fasciitis or something, but stopped wearing them and the pain went away. So sad because they weren’t uncomfortable. Will wear maybe just to the store or short outings."
Adidas,3,"I was so excited to get these in hopes of replacing my old running shoes with them, but no such luck. They have very little support and find that they’re better for running errands in, not working out in. Still very cute though!"
Adidas,3,"I was very excited for these shoes and ordered my normal size Nine and getting them onto my foot was almost impossible!! It was tug-of-war! Once on though, they seemed comfortable enough. I probably could go up a size. So order a size up."
Adidas,3,I wasn’t expecting the shoelaces to be in the shoe. It is a bit narrow for my feet.
Adidas,3,"I wear a 7 normally, but with running shoes usually wear a 7.5. Silly me, ordered a 7 based on other reviewers saying these shoes run large. They do not: they are pretty true to standard fit. Amazon is wonderful with returns, so I returned and got a 7.5 and they fit great. I advise you to order what you normally do with athletic shoes.

These are good for bopping around town. I do not think they would be good for running as they seem to have very little shock absorption. The sole seems very thin and without much support. I wore these hiking on mountain/forest trails. They didn’t perform all that well—they just were not robust enough. Normally a good pair of running shoes would do well in those conditions.

I recommend them if you are looking for attractive shoes to wear when you need comfort. They do not seem like high performance shoes. That said, they seem a tad overpriced.

All said, they are ok. I like them. I don’t love them."
Adidas,3,I wish I wanted to give it all 5 stars! They’re super cute but they feel cheaply made. I can see how the soles can just wear down because it’s literally foam. I’m going to keep and hope it’ll last because I’m only using them as shoes to throw on with a top and leggings but I’m nervous to wear these things on anything except grass. I would not wear these to run except on a treadmill.
Adidas,3,"I wore them once, unpacked to find them stretched out to the point they no longer fit. Big addidas fan never had this happen before. So brought it to their attention. Replacements are great!"
Adidas,3,I’m normally a 7.5 women’s. These run a little big. I could have gotten a 7. They are cute and comfortable *for walking*. They lack the necessary support for running. First time in them it killed my knees which is also the classic sign for me that it’s the shoe. You can buy supportive running inserts for around $12-$16 and it really helps. No pain in the knees with them inside the shoe. Flawed design for running but otherwise a decent shoe.
Adidas,3,I’m returning only because they’re a bit large but the way the box came completely destroyed is not cool.
Adidas,3,"I’ve had these for a couple weeks, worn them maybe 4-5 times and there is a piece of the fabric inside that is already coming apart. I haven’t worn adidas in a while but was surprised at how narrow they are. Love the shoes, but not pleased with the quality."
Adidas,3,"Ibabsolutely LOVE these shoes.  This was the second pair I purchased.  They are so lightweight and comfortable! I wear them for walking, working out, and boxing.  Highly recommend!"
Adidas,3,"If running on gravel or other uneven ground the soles are so thin that the rocks and sticks poke the feet causing pain and discomfort. I do not experience this problem with other similar running shoes.  These are not rough mountain trails, these are well groomed/maintained (albeit uneven) surfaces.

Gym/tracks/roads are all good so likely going to work for most people."
Adidas,3,If you are looking for daily brisk walk or run than this is not for you.
Adidas,3,"If you don't have any foot issues then these are an attractive choice. While they feel very comfortable at first, they have very little support and may end up aggravating issues if worn for a full day. Try new balance or ascics for a similarly priced product that includes the support you need."
Adidas,3,"I'm a size 7 and a 6.5. This shoe runs really small. I took a 7.5. Also, feels like clouds when you put them on. An hour later my feet are killing me with very little strenuous walking. I saw these at kohl's for 63$ today and got them here for $35. That's about the worth of them."
Adidas,3,"I'm on my second pair of these in a year. I wouldn't have purchased again except they are so comfy and cute and easy to put on. The problem with them is that the soles wear out incredibly quick! I have only had this pair for a month and already they are wearing down. My last pair wore completely through (you could see the fabric of the shoe) in 8 months and I only wear them to walk my dog. Only reason I decided to reorder is I found them on sale for Prime Day. I wouldn't pay full price for these until they fix the issue with the soles.

Order a half size up - I'm normally a 9.5 and I'm a 9 in these."
Adidas,3,"Is you are looking for a shoe to train with, they are not snug they are a wide fit. So is not very stable. Otherwise super comfy for street wear."
Adidas,3,It did not provide enough arch support for me.
Adidas,3,It feels like I am walking on clouds. The most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever had!
Adidas,3,It is a comfortable shoe.
Adidas,3,It is hard finding good shoes to walk in when u have foot problems. My mom who has foot problems loves these shoes they fit perfectly and we're comfortable for her.
Adidas,3,"It is stylish, lightweight and fit well. However there is not much support on the sides which only good for walking but not running or exercises."
Adidas,3,It is supposed to be my size but I could not get my foot into it.
Adidas,3,"It was $40 when I first saw it on Amazon and when I was going to check out it changed to $56 - , finally got it  $52 , but now I see this $40 again.
It's pretty but poorly ventilated than I expected and the logo on the side came off half way so I had to glue it down."
Adidas,3,It was late and I paid the extra to be delivered. Can I get a refund on the extra I paid ?
Adidas,3,It’s little bit larger...I am a 9 and half and usually 9 and half is perfect fit for me. This one is little loose around ankle but it’s very comfortable
Adidas,3,It’s very tight at the tongue but don’t go up a size because it won’t fit.
Adidas,3,"It's fine, but I could have gotten the same shoes cheaper at Costco."
Adidas,3,Its my size as far as length but the shoe fits tight width wise.
Adidas,3,Just a little to narrow for me but they should wear in just fine.
Adidas,3,Just as it said they are very comfortable.
Adidas,3,Just got them today right on time! So far they feel great really light weight. they're almost a slip on.we shall see how I fare after a 13 hour shift.
Adidas,3,Know that this seller charges you to return. I will not be ordering the size lower in case fit isn’t right still. That would be $10 in returns alone.
Adidas,3,"Light and comfortable. Very cute but don’t acknowledge that people wear socks. The side is so low even the smallest sock shows. Not the Worst but would be way better if the sock didn’t have to show, especially since not all my socks are the same color as the shoe!"
Adidas,3,"Light weight, but not very supportive."
Adidas,3,"Lightest weight shoe ever. Which unfortunately means thin sole. Comfortable unless walking n running on rock surfaces, I feel every big rock in the gravel. Maybe insoles will help. 😩"
Adidas,3,Like a size and half to big I'm a 6.5 I still had a lot of room. But good very light shoe
Adidas,3,Look good but not as comfortable as I need.  Lightweight but not good for hard surfaces.
Adidas,3,"Love Adidas Cloudfoam; have pair in Blk/Wht
Pattern in same size. This pair seemed like they were a wide or even extra wide width, tops were wrinkled as soon as I walked a few steps. Will sadly return."
Adidas,3,"Love love these shoes. Light, comfortable and they look good!"
Adidas,3,love the comfort and the design. they fit wide around the foot. had to put 2 extra soles in them to fill the shoe up.
Adidas,3,"Love them, but there too big! And I'm a classic 8.5 and I'd need at least an 8 maybe even 7.5."
Adidas,3,Love them. Runs big
Adidas,3,"Love these for bumming around, wouldn’t suggest for strenuous workouts or running Cindy errand shoes though!"
Adidas,3,Love these shoes they're so comfy and lightweight .
Adidas,3,"Love these shoes, light and very comfortable. And love the color."
Adidas,3,Love these shoes. I’m a nurse and am on my feet for 12+.
Adidas,3,"LOVE these shoes...BUT....
They are comfortable and perfect for casual errands and days when I want to be sporty cute and comfortable, which is exactly what I bought them for.  I also got a good deal on the price.  They are stretchy enough to slip on an off after tying, which is a huge plus for me.

I cannot imagine, however, running or doing any serious exercise in these shoes. They are comfortable for walking, but they don't provide enough structure or support for actual running. They also don't feel like they would hold up well AT ALL to any kind of serious exercise.  I've worn them a handful of times, and I love them, but I'm not confident they will hold up."
Adidas,3,Love these. Easy slip on off. Comfortable  got walking and running
Adidas,3,Loved these shoes! I Have worn them almost daily for six months to walk my dogs 1.5 miles on concrete. They are extremely comfortable and I love the slip on aspect but I already have a hole in the sole! Really sad about their durability. They would be terrific shoes if the soles lasted longer. Everything else is perfect.
Adidas,3,"Me encantan, estan hermosos y super comodos"
Adidas,3,"Mixed review… I like the shoe, it was light weight, nice looking, and fit well on my foot. And yet, I still had to return them. The tongue of the shoe seemed just a bit too long and it rubbed against my ankle as I moved. Nice shoes, just not for me."
Adidas,3,My favorite athletic shoes! I have them in three colors!
Adidas,3,"Narrow in toes. Bought for walking and exercise, but won’t work for that. The back of heel rubs-it’s too high up."
Adidas,3,Narrow! Too small.
Adidas,3,"Narrow, they  run small"
Adidas,3,Nice but not for wide feet
Adidas,3,"Nice looking shoe but way too big.
I normally wear an 8 1/2 and that’s what I ordered. I could probably wear a 7 1/2 in those."
Adidas,3,Nice shoed. But they already breaks and tears after less than 2 months. Now worth the money they break already.
Adidas,3,nice style nice color nice price
Adidas,3,no comment
Adidas,3,"No cushioning or support. Very light weight.  Would not recommend for cardio or HIIT workouts; maybe just as a casual walking shoe. Overall,  great color and lots of compliments on how they look, but how they feel is another story."
Adidas,3,"No support, very thin bottoms
I can like feel the shape of rocks as I run
But they cute and fine for low impact walking"
Adidas,3,Normally wear a 9 and ordered a 9. Wish I’d read reviews first and would have sized down. These gave me bad blisters. The tongue rubs on the top of foot badly. Did not like. Ended up selling them gently-used on a Facebook site.
Adidas,3,Not a fan. I love Adidas but these were a bad choice. They might work for a walking shoe but I dont recommend wearing them for working out. They don't offer much support at all and feel cheap. They also are a little narrow and long?
Adidas,3,Not all that stable or comfortable. Feet hurt in a few hours.
Adidas,3,Not as comfy as I had hoped
Adidas,3,Not comfortable and narrow in the toe part
Adidas,3,Not enough support
Adidas,3,"Not my favorite shoes out there, but not shoe can be a favorite! Fit to size!"
Adidas,3,Not my most comfortable shoe.  On my feet for 6 hours and they held up ok.  I felt like my foot soaked into the sole and that I was almost barefooted.  Held up well to the heat of the field. I’ve had shoe glue melt from the heat of the football field.  But I could feel the heat through the shoe.
Adidas,3,Not quite as cushioned as I expected. Unhappy with this for walking.
Adidas,3,"Not sure what all the hype is with these? There was minimal arch support, and literally no cushion. Pretty disappointed."
Adidas,3,Not that comfortable
Adidas,3,Not the best shoe. I have wider feet and these are pretty narrow. I can still fit in them but they are a little tight and uncomfortable. I would only wear these casually because I feel like they don’t provide enough support for activities such as running.
Adidas,3,Not the color I was anticipating. I thought these were going to be more of a red maroon color but they’re more like dark purple. Returning.
Adidas,3,Not very comfortable around the inside of the ankle area- it has some elastic inside. Wearing socks you can’t feel it so bad but I am pretty sensitive about things being smooth and this isn’t smooth inside. They are very light which is nice. I will wear them but they aren’t as nice as my last two pair (different brand).
Adidas,3,"Not very comfortable, the cushion feels like styrofoam or something and they’re pretty stiff. They are cute though and I liked the color and style for something non-black but still subtle. They’d probably be fine for errands, but I wanted them for being on my feet all day and I don’t think they would’ve been a good choice."
Adidas,3,"Not worth the money. they fit true to size.
Look good.  But I've bought more comfortable shoes from Target."
Adidas,3,"Okay, these ARE cute if you just want a stylish sneaker to wear with leggings and run errands in; however- they are not made for exercise/fitness walking- and certainly NOT for running. There is no support, and virtually NO padding. It may say ""cloud foam"" but there is more padding in my flip flops than these shoes. If you can get a pair for a good price, and just want them for the look then go for it, but I would not recommend wearing/walking in them for long periods of time."

If you can get a pair for a good price, and just want them for the look then go for it, but I would not recommend wearing/walking in them for long periods of time."
Adidas,3,"Okay, this is a comfortable shoe for walking. I have had many Adidas shoes from street shoes to running shoes and they have been fantastic. This one however is very loose and is okay for walking but not running. It is also slightly too large. I have been a size 9 in all my adidas running shoes.
I would go down half size if I ordered"
Adidas,3,"Once I get the shoe on, it fits very well, but I struggle getting it on and that discourages me from wearing them as much as I would like to."
Adidas,3,Order my regular size 8.5 and they were to big. I compared to my new balance and they were about a inch bigger. I put my foot in and they weren’t all that comfortable. My new balance fresh foam sport and fuel core nergize are way more comfortable.
Adidas,3,Ordered a size 7.5 and they sent me a size 8 they are alittle big. Which sucks because now they are out of my size! Looks like I'm stuck with alittle bit larger shoes. 🤷‍♀️
Adidas,3,Over all this shoe  looks and feels great.  I only gave it 3 stars because I think its quality wont last for the long haul.
Adidas,3,Perfect shoes
Adidas,3,"Perfectly fine for walking and running errands, but they hurt my feet when I do HIIT workouts. Do not recommend for working out."
Adidas,3,Personally I felt there was no support for running in this shoes . Even doing regular workouts they felt too thin. They were comfortable for doing everyday activities like running errands but definitely not for running.
Adidas,3,"Poor fit on narrow feet, not enough support or way to tighten. Foot slid around, returned."
Adidas,3,"possible cute shoes, but I am disappointed they came with no laces! Now I have to go and try to find the “correct” laces to fit with these shoes. Otherwise, comfy and what I wanted.. except the laces :("
Adidas,3,"product runs wide and this should have been disclosed.  Otherwise the length and comfort, quality of construction are good"
Adidas,3,"Pros:  super light weight, easy on and off, fashionable. Cons: not enough cushion throughout but especially in the ball of the foot, not.much support"
Adidas,3,"Pros:
-Easy to slip on.
- Comfortable for casual walking.

Cons:
- Not a lot of support around the foot.
- I could almost feel the grounds after longer walking.
- I would NOT recommend these for running or more intense workouts."
Adidas,3,Quality shoes but hurt my toes because they were too big. I ordered a 1/2 size smaller and still hurt my feet.
Adidas,3,"Really beautiful shoes, but first time I run, I felt like they were extremelly flat, I could felt the floor, and now, I have wore they few times, but something with the fabric is happening, I hope they don't break."
Adidas,3,"Really cute, I’m very impressed with the design, but not as comfy/ structured as I expected. No support.

Update: still pretty darn bad"
Adidas,3,"Really love the shoes, I ordered my normal size (9.5) however pretty big. I’m making them work but I would suggest buying at least .5 smaller."
Adidas,3,"Really nice looking shoes, confortable as well, never the less they are bigger than expected, 1/2 a size smaller would be great."
Adidas,3,Ripped after 2 months!
Adidas,3,"Roomier than I expected. I actually feel the ground in the ball of my foot quite quickly...I'd hopped for more cushion in that area, otherwise I'd have just ordered vibrams. I WAY overpriced in my opinion.  I am very disappointed.  For a runner it doesn't have enough cushion. For walking I could find a much cheaper shoe that fits more snugly...it is not a stable enough for weight training.  I may return, but unfortunately ran with them outside....so I may not be able to."
Adidas,3,Run about a half size too big.
Adidas,3,Runs at least a size too small. I wear a 7 in all tennis shoes and these were crushing my toes. Ended up returning because a different pair I bought from amazon were way more comfortable for half the price. Size up at LEAST half a size if not a full size.
Adidas,3,Se ve. De excelente calidad. Justo del color deseado
Adidas,3,Sent them back not comfortable
Adidas,3,She is picky and hard to buy shoes for.  She loves these for fit and comfort and wears them every day.  2nd pair I've purchased for her.
Adidas,3,"Shoe is nice looking and a great quality, but we ordered two different sizes and still even a size larger was to small."
Adidas,3,"Shoe is ok, but Size down, they are about a half size to big."
Adidas,3,Shoe was too narrow and could not wear it for more than couple of hours.
Adidas,3,Shoes are light and comfortable.
Adidas,3,"Shoes are light weight, no support, I wear for work and do a lot of running and difference positions. The shoes loosen up and constantly having to adjust laces for tightness. Great casual shoe, but not recommend for running."
Adidas,3,"Size up. Too small. Also beware of which specific shoes you get. Mine particularly came from a 3rd party seller and I had to pay for postage all the way across the country to return. It really sucked, $70 shoes that are indefinitely too small and the seller won’t even let me exchange for free for the appropriate size."
Adidas,3,Size was too large. Order down a size
Adidas,3,Slightly too large. Literally no support.
Adidas,3,"Slip on shoes but hard to get on, a bit long"
Adidas,3,So comfy and look great. Easy on and off!
Adidas,3,"So heres what's up, I needed shoes for work as I walk about 8 miles a day and will burn through a pair of sneakers in 4 months. I've always liked cloud foam so I figured these would be fine. The foam feels way harder, it looked black on the website but is definitely a denim blue, and I have narrow feet so though you can tighten the laces it make the fabric bunch up. Looks cute? Yes. What I expected? Nope."
Adidas,3,"So I’ve had these shoes for a while. They’re okay. Comfortable most days. I have noticed that I can’t wear them back to back days....almost like I have to wait for the cloud foam to go back up. Otherwise, on the second day, my feet kill me."
Adidas,3,"So these shoes look really nice, but they do not work well if you are going for long walks or if you (as I bought them for) want to go running. They are terrible running shoes. The lack of arch support and thin padding makes it feel like you are running on a flat rock. Walked around in Vegas with them, and they were fine, but again because the lack of padding they feel like rocks after about an hour. Also the tread is almost gone on mine and I only bought them a few months ago. But I still wear them when I stand and cashier for eight hours a day, and they work just fine, and again they look nice and are easy to slip on and off."
Adidas,3,Sole of the shoe felt very thin
Adidas,3,"Son excelentes para salir a caminar o hacer ejercicios, son livianos y suaves. Los he usado todos los días desde que los compré (casi 3 meses) para hacer mis workouts diarios o para hacer largas caminatas, y no se han dañado, siguen como nuevos. Pedí mi talla y me quedó a la perfección. Muy buena relación precio-calidad."
Adidas,3,Super comfortable but the soles are trashed after 4 months. Super sad because I Love these shoes. This would be great every day shoes but not good for walking because the soles were out too fast
Adidas,3,Super comfortable like my other pairs in different colors. But product came with melted shoestrings like a hard plastic all over the shoe strings.
Adidas,3,"Super comfortable, super cute."
Adidas,3,"Super comfy & true to size. Not good for running, not enough cushion in sole. I can even feel my bike pedals through these! But they’re cute and comfy for everyday wear or walking."
Adidas,3,Super cute but absolutely zero support. Would not recommend for running.
Adidas,3,Super cute but they were almost a whole size too big for me even though I ordered myself my usual size.  Thought I would see if it could work but at the end of my work day they were just too uncomfortable so I returned and went with a different shoe.
Adidas,3,"Super cute however, there is little support. Many compliments on the shoes. Great for running errands not so much for working out."
Adidas,3,Super hard to clean... fabric holds every piece of dirt just from walking around.
Adidas,3,Super lightweight & comfortable but not much arch support or cushioning on the soles of the shoes. Not used for running but walking non-stop at work.
Adidas,3,The Adidas Cloudfoam Pure shoe is cool and stylish but they're definitely not for running. There is no arch support so if you do want to wear them for a light jog you will need insoles. I got a size 6.5 but they were a little loose. I'm not sure if a size 6 would have fit better. I ended up returning them.
Adidas,3,"The color of the shoes doesn't look anything like the picture. The show is NOT white, it is a baby/ pale blue. noticeably blue. Other than that the shoe is fine and decent quality for the price. They do need some time for you to break them in though."
Adidas,3,The fit is great and I really like the cloud foam but the stitching inside the shoe by the big toe is off and created a bump in the surface. Kinda uncomfortable.
Adidas,3,The insole were not as comfortable as it had been in another pair I currently own.
Adidas,3,The laces don’t actually tighten the shoe much. It’s more of a slip on sneaker. Wouldn’t buy again.
Adidas,3,"The one thing that stopped me from giving this product a 5 star was the fact that it feels like I received a wide in my shoe size. It is very loose around my foot. As if it's and 8.5W or someone with a wider foot than me tried them on and returned them. Unfortunately I work at a hospital and on my feet all night I needed them right away so returning them was not an option. Other than that, the shoe seems great"
Adidas,3,"The pair I got must have been defective. The left shoe was much wider than the right and the quality was questionable. I own another pair of these and they are my favorite shoe so I was very disappointed when these came ill fitting. I regret not taking pics because they were clearly not made the same. When I called adidas customer service,like amazon suggested, they said there was nothing they could do but return my money on adidas gift card. Not helpful. So I just returned to Amazon."
Adidas,3,The product says white but it’s a white with a pale blue tint. The size also fit smaller than my other shoes which are the exact style and size.
Adidas,3,"The shoe is a great style and very light weight. However, it is not very comfortable. There is no cushion or squish when you walk."
Adidas,3,The shoe is exceptionally comfortable once you get it on. It does not open at the “tongue” area so you have to slide your foot in which is hard to do. Will not purchase a shoe like this design again.
Adidas,3,"The shoe is super comfortable, but runs big. I usually wear size 9, buy need an 8 in this shoe."
Adidas,3,"The shoe is very comfortable, but anytime I walk/run outside, I can feel rocks, or anything on the ground through the soul of the shoe. Definitely better for just a gym shoe."
Adidas,3,"The shoe itself is fairly comfortable, light and flexible. The design flaw is really the tongue and back of the shoe.  They are higher than the average shoe, and firm, so it rubs the ankle on the front and back leaving painful marks. I cannot wear these without higher socks, and longer leggings/tights when I workout, even then it’s uncomfortable in those spots."
Adidas,3,"The shoe looks nice.  But once I put it on and laced them up, the heel would slip off.  It was odd sizing I guess.  I ended up returning because they just wouldn't work."
Adidas,3,"The shoes are beautiful but I am not as sold on their comfort. There is a cheap feeling almost clothe cushion in the toe portion of the shoe that I am not a huge fan of. However, I still liked the shoes well enough to keep them as lifting shoes."
Adidas,3,The shoes are great looking. I normally wear a size 8 in athletic shoes but these in size 8 were big and fit weird around top of foot and ankle area. I had to return them and get size 7.5.
Adidas,3,"The shoes did not come in an Addidas box, they may be fake...who knows! Also, they immediately rubbed a bad blister on my ankle within 10 minutes of wearing. They seem to run 1/2 - 1 size big. Love the dark maroon/oxblood color though."
Adidas,3,"The shoes do not have enough support to keep them from rolling to the outside. Other than that, they are good."
Adidas,3,"The shoes run big, at least a half size. The bottoms are not a sturdy material and wear down quickly leaving no tread. They are cute and easy to slip on, making them great for running errands but not much else."
Adidas,3,"The shoes were as expected and fit true to size.  However, they arrived as just two loose shoes thrown in a box.. no shoe box, no tags attached.. just two loose shoes.  For the price I paid I would expect them to be in a shoe box or at least have tags attached."
Adidas,3,The soles were too slick. I had to return. Disappointed because they were pretty comfortable. They fit a little large. I always get an 8.5 in sneakers (because I like a little more wiggle room in my sneakers) and an 8 or sometimes even a 7.5 in heels or sandals. So I ordered the 8.5 as usual and felt like they were too big. I could've gone with a .5 size smaller.
Adidas,3,"The style of this shoe is super cute. However, the cloudfoam insole is at least 1/4 inch smaller than the inside of the shoe. Immediately I noticed ""hot spots"" on my toes where they were hanging off the edge of the insole. I bought these for a Disney World trip and need something super comfortable without weird ridges on the toes. They'd be fine for a fashion sneaker, but wouldn't work for lots of walking or running."
Adidas,3,The toe is basically just fabrics and offers little support but it is a very flexible shoe.
Adidas,3,The tongue is attached not separated! I didn’t realize this and it was way too tight for my phone! And it was a little long for my foot! But they looked amazing!
Adidas,3,The tongues of these shoes rubbed the front of my leg. The soles of the shoes are very comfortable but the issue with the tongues makes too uncomfortable to wear.
Adidas,3,The top of the shoe is quite rigid and bruises my legs.
Adidas,3,The traction sucks but most importantly I would not describe this shoe as cloudfoam. I have worn for a few days and can no longer return due to using them so will have to buy inserts to make them comfortable
Adidas,3,There are nice looking and I have gotten a compliment when I was wearing them but I struggle to get them over my heel. They fit fine once I do. Also light which is the reason I bought them but cannot imagine running in them. Also not worth 50 bucks.
Adidas,3,"There was a brown stain on the side of the shoes, obviously it was a return because it came in a weird box. Otherwise shoes are fine and fit great. Note that the “white” is more of a blue tint"
Adidas,3,"These are a little too loose, and the laces cannot be tightened to accomodate."
Adidas,3,These are absolutely the most comfortable tennis shoes I have ever worn.  It feels like I'm walking on air.  I also get compliments whenever I wear them and people tell me they want to get a pair.  They look good whether wearing with casual clothes or professional attire.  I have a pair at home and bought these to wear in the office when I want to take a walk over lunch for some exercise. I needed to buy a 1/2 size larger than I normally wear because they are slip-ons which makes them a little more snug than regular lace-up tennis shoes.
Adidas,3,"These are cute, but they don't have the support I need from a running shoe.  I would recommend the Cloadfoam QT Racer instead as an alternative.  Accidentally bought a size too small, I usually wear 8.5 in Saucony and Nike sheos, but I've learned that a 9 fits better for Adidas shoes."
Adidas,3,"These are not great for running. Only really suitable for running on a track, no other surface. Cute, but I will not get my monies worth since I wanted/needed running shoes. I will stick to Brooks."
Adidas,3,These are not running shoes. For of a leisure shoe.  Lightweight. Shoelaces are stupid. Not needed. Hard to get on. Best worn without socks.
Adidas,3,These are ok. There is a reason there is such a mix view on these shoes. They are not terribly comfortable.
Adidas,3,These are really cute but they run a little on the narrow side (I do have a smidge of a wide foot but don’t normally need wides). The footbed was nice & squishy but I couldn’t get over the squeeze of the foot feeling so had to return them. Also I usually wear a 9 but got these in an 8 1/2 which the length worked just too snug on the sides
Adidas,3,"These are really cute shoes. Not meant for running or sporty activities but super cute. I wouldn't say they're for a wider foot. These shoes are narrow. So, narrow foot and dont play sports, you good!"
Adidas,3,These are slightly larger than another brand new pair of Adidas cloudfoam that I just purchased. The insoles are also song differently. It is slightly uncomfortable around the edges. I guess there's a reason why they didn't cost as much as the others. I'm still going to wear them. It's not a huge issue but I expected better quality.
Adidas,3,"These are super comfortable. They fit a bit smaller than expected, but not too small to justify a return. Would order a half size up.

UPDATE: these shoes wore out extremely fast. The soles pretty much just gave out after only a few months of wear. Would not buy again"
Adidas,3,These are super cute and the fit is really comfortable. I almost kept them but the “tongue” of the shoe is very long and bothered me. It hits the front of my ankle so I feel it rubbing on my skin every time I take a step. I’m going to try to look for a pair with a lower tongue.
Adidas,3,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have owned in years (since Nike restructured their Free line). They are flexible and don't rub my toes or heels and they look cute with leggings and jeans. BUT, and it's a big but, they need work in the durability department. I'm on my second pair in less than a year. Each pair only seems to last 4 to 6 months with moderate walking (maybe 5-8 miles a week) before I wear a hole straight through the bottom at the ball of my foot. Now, maybe this is an issue with the way my foot lands, but I still have in tact soles on running shoes that are years older so I doubt that's the only factor. I purchased some backup pairs at a deep discount over the holidays and I bought some cheap, thin inserts to hopefully prolong their life a bit. If you don't expect these to be a lasting investment, they're a great pair of shoes."
Adidas,3,These aren’t for working out! Barely comfortable after walking a bit around the mall.  Zero support.  But they were super cheap and cute so for that they are great!! Don’t expect any comfort after an hour.  They hurt my arches.  Maybe support will help me.
Adidas,3,"These aren't the most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn - I feel like I'm right between sizes so the contour of these don't fit my feet well but a size down would be oppressive on my toes.  I like that I can leave them tied and slip them on, and I like that they are slim and not bulky sneakers."
Adidas,3,These caused pain in my right ankle. It’s odd that it was just one side and they were also a little too narrow for my wide feet. The way it’s cut just rubbed against my ankle in a weird way.
Adidas,3,"These felt so comfortable straight out of the box, I was in love.  Then after a few walks my feet hurt a ton. Unfortunately they lack any real support."
Adidas,3,These for poorly. They were too long in the length but too narrow to pull on. The laces are more for decoration than for function.
Adidas,3,These just do not have great support or comfort - they are very cute but wouldn’t wear them for any distance or length of time
Adidas,3,"These run a little big, I should have gone a half size to a full size down. The front of the shoe rubs the front of my ankle and left a mark after walking in them. Also, regular socks look pretty odd with the way these are cut around the tops. However, they are a cute shoe if you’re just going off looks."
Adidas,3,These shoes a very nice but super small hole to put foot in and doesnt stretch much.
Adidas,3,These shoes are ADORABLE! They fit perfectly and were very comfortable. I only gave them 3 stars because the left shoe had a yellow/brown stain on it. I’m returning but will buy again!!
Adidas,3,"These shoes are cute and fit well, but they don’t provide enough support and cushioning for running."
Adidas,3,These shoes are incredibly comfortable and stylish.  I am normally a size 7 so I ordered that size.  They fit perfectly.
Adidas,3,"These shoes are quite narrow especially in the toe box. They were at least a 1/2 size too small if not more. If they were wider and had better support, I could probably wear my actual size. BTW: I'm a 7 in Big Kid (approx. equal to Women's 9) & Women's 9 in most other brands.. and the 9.5 was STILL too small around my toes. They are just too long and too narrow. Hard to walk. Also quality is wayyyyy below that of the $30 Men's version that's sold at Costco. Bottom line: Adidas sizing is really realy really (did I say really?) INCONSISTENT! It doesn't matter what size you think you wear, never buy w/o giving it a second thought. With Adidas, I own a pair of 8.5 in Women's AND another in Men's 8.5. How is that possible? The Women's 9.5 that I ended up returning were GIANT. At least two sizes too big. Talk about clown shoes..."
Adidas,3,These shoes are so comfy and fit true to size- highly recommend!!
Adidas,3,"These shoes are super cute and lightweight, but I got them for the “Cloudfoam” so that I could do more walking outside since the gyms are closed. They are comfortable enough for a leisurely walk, but the didn’t feel the way I hoped for a serious walk or workout. So great for fashion, but not exercise."
Adidas,3,"These shoes are super soft, lightweight, breathable, and comfortable on my feet, but they provide absolutely zero support.  They feel like walking in slippers.  Walking outdoors, I can feel everything in the ground.  There is zero foot or arch support.  I would absolutely not work out or run in these shoes.  I bought these primarily for wearing in my office as I have switched to scrubs at work.  I am going to keep these shoes, but I don't feel they have enough support to be on my feet all day and everyday.  I will be putting an arch support insert in these shoes. I normally wear a 7W or a 7.5M in a dress shoe and an 8 in a running shoe (New Balance, Asics, Brooks).  I purchased a size 8 and there is over a thumbs width of room in the heel area.  I should have purchases a 7.5, but it's not a deal breaker."
Adidas,3,These shoes are too tight across the top of the shoe and narrow at the top of the toes
Adidas,3,"These shoes are very comfortable and cute, but I would not use them for running shoes. They are very lightweight.
I wear a 7 and order a 7 and they fit just right."
Adidas,3,"THESE SHOES HAVE ZERO FLOOR GRIP! cute to wear around casually but NOT meant for lifting, working out, and especially not for running! Performance shoe is the wrong name for this shoe"
Adidas,3,these shoes Run about one size too big. I have really high arches and had some serious difficulty getting these on because the tongue does not move! I usually wear a 7 but order a 6.5 and I still have extra room. I wish I would have bought a 6 but with the issue with my high arches it probably best that I got the 6.5 hopefully i can stretch the top out some to make it easier for my to put these shoes on but if not I will more than likely have to return them.
Adidas,3,These shoes were such a disappointment. They are beautiful and looked so comfy. I couldn't even get them on though. I ordered the correct size so I don't know if they were manufactured incorrectly or if I just have a high instep. Not sure which but had to return.
Adidas,3,These were brutal on my feet after first use. Only gave 3 stars as they are cute. Would not recommend for running!
Adidas,3,"These were comfortable in the beginning, but the comfort is wearing off after a few months. They don’t provide much support. They were also super wide on me (and I would consider myself to have a wider foot), and I had to pull the laces super tight to get a decent fit. I love the look of them, though."
Adidas,3,These were not my favorite. Too big and my feet would slide when I worked out.
Adidas,3,These were really cute but I was looking more for a white sneaker for daily wear so am returning.
Adidas,3,"They are comfy, lightweight & Great for running errands & easy walks. Not for a serious runner."
Adidas,3,"They are nice, light weight, nice color but nothing I would buy again. They slip off when I’m running and very thin."
Adidas,3,They are really comfortable but make tour feet look hugeeeee. I am just a woman's size 8. Honestly I regret wearing these so much and now I can't return because they are used. And they are just so big. I would definitely order .5 to half a size smaller if I were you.
Adidas,3,"They are super cute, and very comfortable. Unfortunately the tongue of the shoes rub the top of my ankle and are causing blisters"
Adidas,3,They don't fit snug so feet slide around
Adidas,3,They get dirty very fast (I only wear to work) and very hard to clean.
Adidas,3,They run big with a wide toe section. Hard to tighten with the laces given it doesn’t have a traditional tongue. Overall comfortable but wouldn’t purchase again
Adidas,3,"They’re cute and they do what they need to, but they also feel low quality. They’re very light and feel amazing at first but quickly lose the support and comfort. The foam bottom is nice but just seems like cheap quality. Overall, for the price they’re amazing, fit as expected, and super light. My feet do hurt, though, after a 3 mile walk in these."
Adidas,3,"They’re cute, but no support and the cushion part for the sole is so funky- it doesn’t cover the entire shoe. The only thing going for it is it’s looks. Super stylish and cute. I think over priced for quality, which is such a disappointment from Addidas. I would only use these shoes for casual walking."
Adidas,3,"They’re sufficient and cute for daily errands, walks to class, etc. but do not get them for running! Not supportive and no arch. I’ll still be keeping them for other things though because they’re nice looking! Also, they’re pretty wide if you have a narrow foot."
Adidas,3,This is a great errand shoe or every day around the house. My expectation was a good summer tennis shoe for 1 mile + walks and exercise but this isn't a workout tennis shoe. Think more of a cushioned regular shoe. No support for exercising. I feel every rock I walk on and arches ache after cardio. Would choose something else for exercise or longer walks.
Adidas,3,"This is a great shoe if you haven't had the foam support or if you're used to a small amount of foam support.  I went from Sketchers to these and it just felt like I was walking on the hardest possible surface.  I had to return them and stick with Sketchers (my complaint with Sketchers is the heel area wearing out which is why I wanted to try something different).

Also, definitely go down a half size."
Adidas,3,This is my second pair! Love these shoes for the look and the comfort. I gave the support 4 stars just because it is not a snug but a hug fitting shoe. the main reason I like them! Super light sole so if you're looking for a running shoe with a heavy tread this is not it! The price is right so I will buy more!
Adidas,3,"This pinch my toes and I bought a half size up guess I needed a full size up
but I did like how they slip on and stay tied"
Adidas,3,This shoe is cute and stylish as a daily wear shoe. I don't see it having enough support for excercise as it does not provide stability and does not cup your heel.
Adidas,3,This shoe is so comfortable!
Adidas,3,"This shoe is very cute and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it so far. Unfortunately, I will be returning these since they have no arch support. I felt like I was walking right on the ground. If you have zero foot/ankle issues, then I think you would maybe be ok trading comfort for the look of the shoe."
Adidas,3,This shoe is very light weight which doesn’t offer the most support.  When it comes to comfort it has pros and cons; the cons- it has a lip inside the shoe that is a bit uncomfortable that rubs on your foot it also is almost to light weight. Pros overall it comfortable for running errands and work and a good price.
Adidas,3,This shoe is wide at the toe but not at the opening. I had plenty of wiggle room except the very top/opening. It was so tight it left bruises. I hope I can stretch that out because the rest of the shoe is great.
Adidas,3,This shoe was comfortable but did not give the support I need.
Adidas,3,This shoe was super narrow and tight.  I sent it back because it was not a good fit for me.  I have wider feet and it looked like a shoe I had from reebok but it was too small and narrow.
Adidas,3,To me these aren’t really running shoes but fashion shoes.  They look cute with nearly anything but I could never wear them to do much more than run a few errands. They’re not very supportive and make my feet and knees hurt after a few hours. I’d give them a 5 star if it was just for cute factor.
Adidas,3,"To me, the name is super misleading. With a name like ""cloudfoam,"" I expected them to form to my feet like memory foam but no it has no cloud or foam-like feeling whatsoever which is weird. The shoes fit as expected and are somewhat comfortable BUT they do not have a tongue so they are a little difficult to get on, the back is high so my regular pants constantly get caught in it since it sticks out which is the most annoying, the sides are a little higher which rubs my ankle a little bit, and the strings are useless in my opinion so they are more of an annoyance. I probably would not buy again. I'm glad I didn't spend much because they are definitely not my go to pair of shoes. I'm giving it 3 stars solely for the fact that they are cute."
Adidas,3,"Too big, very uncomfortable, the sole was thin and hard as a rock and didn't bend when you walk. I don't understand why people say these are comfortable. Also they do not slide on easy at all. You may as well just tie your shoes."
Adidas,3,"Too large for a normal 6.5.
And it's definitely not for running, the bottom is too thin."
Adidas,3,"Too whimpy to consider impact reduction from even a treadmill run !
Cute for house shoes!"
Adidas,3,True to fit but the insoles are so narrow that my feet go over the edge. And I don’t have wide feet by any means. I had to buy some new thin insoles to put over them because they’re sewn into the shoe
Adidas,3,"True to size, girlfriend uses them for work and doesn’t complain anymore about her feet afterward!!! These are a great buy!!"
Adidas,3,True to size. Light weight but not as much cushion as I would’ve thought.
Adidas,3,"True to size. Super comfy and good insole BUT more for looks than any cardio. There is no outer shell to keep your foot in place and the insoles are a slick mesh material. This keeps them from getting stinky but unless you wear them without socks (EW!) your foot will slide all over!
Great white shoe! It has grey stitching so it hides the dirt :)"
Adidas,3,"Unfortunately had to return this product, bought it for a workout/ walking shoe and had no support whatsoever. I am healing from stress fracture running injuries and need more support than this shoe provided. Super cute and stylish just not what I was looking for."
Adidas,3,Usually we’re 8.5 but I would go a half size down. Super comfortable
Adidas,3,Very comfortable shoes will buy another pair
Adidas,3,"Very comfy, but SO HARD to get on!! The tongue is attached to the rest of the shoe, so that whole thing you do where you loosen the laces So you can get it on your foot.. that’s not a thing with these. Once they’re on they’re very comfy but I will be returning them. I don’t have time to struggle and sweat just to get them on my feet. Very disappointing!"
Adidas,3,"Very comfy, I noticed after I wore these for the first time, my lower back hurts less!!!"
Adidas,3,Very cute but they run super narrow. I was an 11 before I had my daughter and now typically wear 11-11.5 depending on width of the shoes. I ordered an 11.5 just to be safe since I wear socks with my gym shoes. These are so snug they’re hurting my feet. I’ll have to try a 12 next time or only wear these for everyday use
Adidas,3,Very cute but thin soles and lack of lateral support make these good for walking around and going to the gym. Inadequate for running or long distance walking
Adidas,3,Very cute no support too big
Adidas,3,"Very cute shoes, but not so great for exercising. I’ve been wearing them on the treadmill 30 mins/day for about 2 weeks, and I can barely walk now. Shin splints are awful. Just not enough support. I kept trying to push through, tried different stretches, warm up, cool downs, etc. the only variable left is these shoes."
Adidas,3,"Very light weight and easy to slip on but when having plantar fasciitis while commuting all over NYC, I needed to buy different insoles to put in the shoes."
Adidas,3,Very much like this shoe for walking on asphalt however it does not stand up to my elliptical machine. The soles are quickly wearing out in just one month.
Adidas,3,Very nice light pink color. They seem well made.  The laces do not lace like other sneakers. They are a tad bigger than described. I wear an 8.5 normally but when I put these on they were bigger yet an 8 would be too small so I had to send them back.
Adidas,3,Very nice looking shoes but no arch or sole support and they aren’t reasonable for distance walking or exercise. I’d say these will be my shoes for running errands but I wouldn’t recommend them for even light exercise.
Adidas,3,Very soft and stretchy. Not for a person who needs support or who abducts or adducts. (Turns foot in or out) it is cute and can be put on without using shoelaces.
Adidas,3,"Very stylish and comfortable. This shoe is called Cloudfoam for a reason, it is so light you feel like you are not wearing shoes. But that doesn't mean it is super cheap and flimsy. Somehow, it is the softest tennis shoe I own. I wear it nearly everyday. Great for walking."
Adidas,3,Wanted these for work but rub the front of my ankle due to tongue label and not much cushioning for being on my feet for 8 hours.
Adidas,3,Was to narrow for my feet
Adidas,3,Way to small runs very small and narrow
Adidas,3,way too small... ive worn them for a few weeks to see if they will stretch and they won't. Their so cute and comfortable i can't let them go
Adidas,3,Why won’t adidas make women’s size 12? Do they hate us? Idk but I won’t be stepping foot in an adidas anytime soon.
Adidas,3,"Wide shoes, would be better for those with wide feet. I feel as if my foot is sliding around when I wear then"
Adidas,3,"With a name like Cloudfoam in the title/description, I expected them to have more cushion or comfort in the insole. They are semi-hard on middle aged feet. Not comfortable."
Adidas,3,"Would love to give these 5 stars but can not.
Lightweight.
Cute on.
The ankle design is great no slipping.
These would be comfortable but not as a running shoe by any means.
I normally wear an 8. These fit great everywhere but too much toe room. Could of maybe fit a 7 1/2 better.

The biggest complaint is that foot bed.
There is a good feeling memory foam type insole.
The problem is it is not cut right.
There is atleast 1/2 inch gap around the whole toes and ball of the foot area.
You feel the hard rough uncovered area all around the edge of your foot.
Noticed right away so I stuck my hand in the shoe to feel what I was feeling hard. It is where there is no insole or cushion at all.
Manufacturing flaw for sure.
Will most likely return because it is so uncomfortable which can not be good for anyones feet."
Adidas,3,Would recommend upsizing at least a half size. They are very comfortable however if you plan to wear them while working and are up on your feet for 12 hours I would not recommend for that
Asics,3,"03/31/21: My original review is below but I wanted to add this update. I contacted ASICS regarding stitches unraveling on my shoes with less than 100 miles on them. ASICS offered me enough credit on their website to replace my shoes. Good customer service.

Beautiful shoe and offers the support I need. The fit was true to size. However, after 3-4 months of wear the stitching on the toe of the left shoe has unraveled. Very disappointed."
Asics,3,After 3 mon strted to fall off apart. After 6mon killing my feet and my knees. I work 40-50hr /wk as a healthcare staff . Never Purchase again.
Asics,3,"After trying six pair of walking shoes, these were the most comfortable. They still have some discomfort but it's the best fitting shoe I've tried thus far."
Asics,3,"Agood shoe. Not as supportive of my feet as I had hoped. I love the shoe laces, easy to tie and untie but will not loosen or come untied on their own!"
Asics,3,"All I wear are ASICS shoes first time buying running shoes, I’m on my feet all the time it was advised to try running over walking for more support these hurt in my arch and toes seem to move around I ordered my regular size and width, just not convinced these are for me 👟"
Asics,3,Always love this brand and buy two a year.  The sizing was incorrect.
Asics,3,Always wore Venture 5 and 6.  Venture 7 runs small with narrow toe box.  Had to return.
Asics,3,"As a long time Asics wearer I have to say, these are not what I am used to from this company. These have been my go to brand for awhile now, 9 years. This pair feels narrow and unlike previous  pairs, they were not great right out of the box. I'm really disappointed  in these."
Asics,3,Asics great value but now make tighter toe box. Have same model-very different from last spring.
Asics,3,"Bough this shoe hoping for a lot more cushion and support, especially arch support. I probably should have gone up in price to get what I needed. This is a good all-round tennis shoe, well made, and great for all activities."
Asics,3,Comfortable but not crazy about the color combo.probably will keep.
Asics,3,"Cute shoes but they should be wider. They are too narrow in the toes and my toes go numb and start tingling after an 1 or 2 hours max of putting them on, so unfortunately I can only where them for short periods of time and forget working out in them. That is a definite no go. Brooks or New Balance have wide options that are actually wide enough and they are much more comfortable if you can afford them."
Asics,3,"Decent shoe, just a bit large, stiff and clunky"
Asics,3,Did fit as I thought...
Asics,3,Didnt work for me. The tie box was too big
Asics,3,Disappointed in this shoe. Bought exact one last year and it fit great with adequate support. This one is awful!
Asics,3,Disappointed. I ordered a wide and it was a tight fit. Took about 2 weeks to stretch out but still not my favorite. The gel actually feels find of hard as well. Should've returned while I had a chance.
Asics,3,"Even though it’s a 91/2 wide, the width is like a Norman shoe fit. For me it was not wide enough, will be returning it. Looks lovely, though!"
Asics,3,Feel stiff and seem narrow for a wide fit.
Asics,3,"Feels as if it is halfway between and 8 and an 8.5... like an 8.25.  Comfortable, no internal seams that rub.  Not as cushioned as expected, but a cute and decent shoe.  Have used them for all day walking but have not used them when running yet."
Asics,3,Fit as expected.
Asics,3,Fits good but their stained from water damage.  Amazon left package at mailbox in the rain!
Asics,3,Fits perfectly. The pain while walking stops. But during the first week itself I felt like there is a hole under  my right toe. Now it start tearing on top of shoe. I am using it for average 5-8 miles  a week. They can improve the quality
Asics,3,For running shoes they are bulky. Laces are flimsy and constantly untie.
Asics,3,"Good looking shoe with lots of positive buyers, just not right for me. I have a high arch and the shoe  felt too tight in the same size 7, the Saucony Cohesion 13 fit better.  Also, I am being charged almost $6. 00 to return and I pay a yearly fee to Amazon, thought returns were free."
Asics,3,Great color
Asics,3,Great shoes but the security tag was left on it.  Good thing my husband had a Dremel.
Asics,3,Had to return these because they have a narrow fit to them.
Asics,3,I am a surgical tech and on my feet for 10 hrs a day. They are comfortable and support my feet nicely.
Asics,3,"I am a true size 10 with skinny flat feet and mild bunions.  Despite this, this shoe in size 10 was tight both width-wise and length-wise.  Once I put in a modest orthotic, there was no room for my feet using a lightweight hiking sock.  Also, I ordered the black/silver.  It is not black.  It is a beautiful blue much like the photo.  I ordered this to replace my ancient Gel-Venture 5 -which is also a size 10 and it fits my foot with the same orthotic and sock comfortably.  The Gel-Venture 7  is a beautiful and well-made shoe. But I'd order a half-size up.  Also, be aware that it is a small toe box that looks dainty and feminine but will be snug all around."
Asics,3,"I bought a pair of this style shoe, different colors, a couple weeks ago and loved them so I bought this second pair.  These shoes had been tried on previously —disgusting— then apparently returned.  The foot bed was covered with pet hair and crumbs.  Gross!  Because they had not been worn, the soles and outside of the shoes were pristine; I went ahead and cleaned them to try them on.  They fit perfectly and I will keep; but I had to vent about their condition.  Note the two pairs came from different sellers."
Asics,3,I bought a size 11 because I'm usually just a little bigger then a 10 1/2 size shoe.  My toe is touching the end of the sneaker.  From some of the reviews I thought this was going to be an awesome cloud like sneaker.  I'm really not impressed and as a matter of fact feel like these aren't that impressive at all compared to the Sketcher's I usually wear.  Definitely would not buy again.
Asics,3,I bought the shoes for walking and it seems to be perfect
Asics,3,"I bought these based on the reviews & 2 pair of Asics that I purchased at Costco (which were a far superior quality). These have NO ARCH SUPPORT. They are completely flat. They also look a little cheap, they're plastic. The colors are nice enough & look good with jeans, from a distance. I added an over the counter orthotic & they're better. I kept them because I returned a pair of Gel Contend 5 & didn't want to be bothered returning these, they were comfortable for the first 15 minutes. Quite frankly, I should have just kept the others & saved myself $10-$12. They weren't any worse. I've bought my final pair of shoes/sneakers on Amazon."
Asics,3,"I bought these because of the good reviews. However, I'm on my feet all day and deal with plantar fasciitis. My feet hurt so bad by the time I got off work I could barely walk. My worn out Brooks feel better than these. For me these were a waste of money as I had to go and order another pair of Brooks. For someone without foot problems these are probably a great pair of shoes."
Asics,3,"I bought these hoping they would stop my feet from hurting, not enough cushioning!"
Asics,3,I bought these running shoes for walking.  When I did a google search about running shoes that are good for knees these came up.  I have never bought ASICS before because they are a narrow shoe( my sister had for years).  It was a surprise to see they came in wide and so that is what I bought.  I haven’t worn them out yet just around the house.  Do I can’t say at this time if I am pleased with them.  At this point the look and the size are good.
Asics,3,"I bought these to replace a well worn pair of Asics Gel Venture 6's. The Gel Ventuee 7's are stiffer and heavier than their predecessor, and not quite as comfortable. One drawback in both pairs of Gel Ventures is that the innersole is not removable which kind of stinks if you want to use more supportive ones. The traction is decent and they look good. They just don't feel the same as the Gel Venture 6's."
Asics,3,I bought these with great hopes of them helping my feet. The toe box is not large enough for my feet. These were recommended by my daughter's physical therapist. They work fine for her and she's had no problem. This brand just probably won't work well for my particular foot issue.
Asics,3,"I buy Asics all the time, but this model is stiff and clunky. Not nearly as comfortable as I'm used to. I've tried putting new insoles in, but they're still just not comfortable."
Asics,3,"I consistently buy the Asics Kahana Gel shoes every year both for work and working out. I like them because they usually provide good stability and arch support, which I need because my arches tend to fall, creating other physical problems.

The problem is they keep changing how the shoes fit or how they support. This particular model doesn't have enough arch support and I've had to buy extra arch inserts for them. I still like the comfort and look (it's so difficult to find shoes without obnoxiously bright, ugly colors). But I seriously wish they'd stop changing them every year."
Asics,3,"I don't get it. I and my mother both wear Asics because of the good arch support. I decided to get these in the rose gold for her and myself. I put them on and compared to my last pair I feel like I am wearing Adidas Sambas, which if you are a soccer player from the 90's, you know are a totally flat shoe. The arch support was not in contact with my arch. I need support. I also noticed that the toe was a bit more rounded for runners than my last pair so I felt like it rolled way too much when I walked compared to my other shoe.
I was kind of sad as I really liked the rose gold shoe. (although I think they should have called it copper)"
Asics,3,"I expected some real foot comfort after all the reviews.  But there is no arch support at all. The shoe bottom is not springy and flexible as a walking sneakers should be. It is rigid rubber sole.
Yes, the sneakers have nice colors, but disappointed with such low attention for design, quality and foot ergonomics."
Asics,3,"I gave them only 3 stars because I have to break them in very stiff and shoe laces are difficult to use
Good how ever is the “gel support “ whic is the reasot I am keeping them
I walk allot with my dog every morning extra support I am thinking will make them last longer"
Asics,3,I got complements for how comfy they looked but they where painful since they did come in smaller than expected . Other wise they are a good buy.
Asics,3,"I guess my arches are higher than these shoes are designed for. Even with alternate shoe lacing the top of my foot (right above arch) bruised.

Also has that annoying hard plastic bit in the heel, FYI"
Asics,3,I had to buy shoes in a hurry and I couldn’t go shopping! I walk a lot and I have a high instep. These will okay for now. I usually by my shoes at New Balance and Fleet Feet. Pretty good for the price.
Asics,3,"I have a wide foot and need arch support. I thought these shoes would help.  They slip in the heel, are difficult to get on and cause blisters on my toes."
Asics,3,"I have been wearing Asics for 15 years now (and I'm only... only?... 30). In the past three or four years, either the quality of lower cost Asics has gone seriously down hill or my feet have just gotten more effed. These have virtually no padding. I had to buy inserts just to make them the least bit comfortable. I also found that the design of the shoe is not great for those with wider feet (even when you purchase a wide) because the overlay pattern is somewhat uncomfortable. I wore these pretty consistently for about 3-4 months, but now I need to phase them out for a more expensive pair of Asics that fit my needs better.

They are cute, though!"
Asics,3,"I have been wearing Asics shoes for many years and usually buy at least two pair at a time, one for walking dogs (2+ miles a day) and one for inside workouts. I bought two pairs back in mid March and wore out both pairs soles in just 8 months. At first I thought that maybe I was just exercising and walking a ton because there was not much else to do with my states restrictions for COVID. The soles were completely flat and the tread worn right down on both pairs. So I decided to order another couple pairs and see how these held up. They suck. I am not even a month into wearing them and the tread is more than halfway worn down. The laces are thin and short and come untied ALL of the time. I have also noticed that in the past they were comfortable and supportive for many months and already this pair is hurting my feet. It's almost as if the cushion is completely gone. Disappointed in the downward trend of quality over the last couple years. Time to find a new favorite brand."
Asics,3,"I have horrible plantar fasciitis and these are great shoes for hiking! Very comfortable. Run a tad big, but I still kept my normal running shoe size. Definitely helps with stability on trails, as well as traction and stepping on sharp roots, acorns, etc."
Asics,3,"I have ordered ASICS before and was pleased but, not so with this order.  They are a tad too large even though I am a perfect 9.5 shoe size.  The support is lacking.  They feel like I am wearing cardboard.  I will keep them to do yard work in but I am now looking a new gym shoe."
Asics,3,"I have other Asic gels for running, and was hoping these would be like those. This pair has a stiff sole (like the color change at the bottom is a very stiff layer) which might be what some people want. But they definitely are too stiff and bulky to be good running shoes. They also have an almost puffy feel to the top of them, which is different than my other ASICS as well. Had to return."
Asics,3,I have two pair of ASICS and I love them. I ordered the same size in the same style but they were too small.
Asics,3,I have worn ASICS for years. I ended up getting this pair instead of the usual pair I just buy each year because they were out of my size in the other style. Unfortunately I wish I had not purchased these. They run the back of my foot and give me blisters. I also have to double knot the laces to keep them tied and they still come lose. I mainly walk in these. Size 7 womens. I’ll be purchasing a pair of my usual style now that they’re available
Asics,3,"I have worn Asics for years...8.5...but this shoe is too short. Very surprised, lived the color though. Not getting a larger size as the heel would be too big."
Asics,3,I have worn Asics plenty of time in the past and have always ordered my usual size 8. These were a full size too small
Asics,3,I like how they look but don't like the shoe strings.  they are very thin.  I also had to by inserts for them right away.  I did not return because they will serve the purpose and look nice.  However they will not be my goto walking shoes and I would probably not buy them again.
Asics,3,I like the colors and the sturdiness but the “shock” absorption from gel isn’t as much as I have experienced with other shoes.
Asics,3,"I like the look of these sneakers and they are comfortable.  However, the bottom feels hard and even though it says ""gel"" on the sole, I don't feel any spring in my steps with these sneakers."
Asics,3,"I like the overall look for these shoes, but my feet hurt really bad while trying to break them in. Not a slip on and go type of shoe."
Asics,3,"I like the shoe...but the toe area pinches down on my toe nail and hurts after a while. I am going to try a 1/2 size bigger and see if that helps. The rubber around the toe must not give. I don't run, but I don't see how anybody could run in these...my toes were killing me after a day on my feet."
Asics,3,I like the shoes but I had to buy replacement insoles because there was nothing to the ones that came in the shoes and they hurt my feet immediately.
Asics,3,"I like the way the shoe looks.  I do not like the way the tongue will not stay in the center, I constantly have to move it.  I am ordering insoles because I do not feel that they are very supportive at all.  I get new shoes every 6 months or so and I have only had these a few weeks.  I walk everyday....my legs have been aching and my feet hurt since I started walking in these shoes.  I have already ordered a new pair, different brand and hopefully they will be better."
Asics,3,i like them overall very pretty and functional but then are so tight they hurt my feet  i should have gotten a size larger than mine because the sizes listed are not accurate.
Asics,3,I like these shoes however they are not black and silver. The only black is the rubber sole and the shoes are navy blue. Also my heel rises a little as I walk. That is why the 3 stars. Other than that good shoes.
Asics,3,I like this tennis because fit well and is comfortable.
Asics,3,I love the color of the blush purple ones but they dont have any support as they are just flat. I got a blister while breaking them in but no more after that. Now they work normally but I need new insoles 🙂🙃
Asics,3,"I love the fit and they are comfortable. I just hate that the color faded after one time wearing them out. I wore them once and now they already look like old shoes. Very disappointing and sad. Love the shoe not the material. I have a feeling they won’t last long. I wish, I knew this before, I wore them. I would like to return them, but can’t. Lesson learned."
Asics,3,"I love to walk and this shoe is very comfortable, unfortunately I ordered a 10W and received a 10 instead but didn’t realize it until after a day of wearing then to work."
Asics,3,I loved the look of these sneakers and after reading reviews I decided to order a size up and in wide. They were still to small. My big toe was hurting after wearing them in the house to see if comfortable. They were returned the next day. I’m going back to New Balance. Their toe box is truly wide and so much better fitting for my feet.
Asics,3,I need a shoe that has a removable insole.  This shoe does not but that doesn’t mean it’s  a bad shoe. Just not for me !!
Asics,3,I order this pair for my work. I like the colour and design. But they are just little too stiff material and bothering my inner side of feet all the time.
Asics,3,"I ordered a size larger than my normal everyday shoes and the were too short. I think it is this particular style, because I have worn size 9 from ASICS for years."
Asics,3,"I ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly. Bought these for work. I'm on my feet all day and have arthritis in my toes with plantar fasciitis as well. Normally, I am nearly in tears at the end of the day, but my feet felt great in these on Day One without a break-in period. They aren't as cushy/springy as other running shoes I've had, but they do what I wanted them to do. I don't like the laces, however - they are thin and flat woven, more like dress shoe laces, and I don't think they'll last long before breaking. I plan to replace them."
Asics,3,"I ordered these and the 5-line, this line (7) is narrow in the toe box and does not feel as supportative in the footbed.  I prefer the 5's for walking and light running.  I'm also not fond of the black color."
Asics,3,I prefer my ASICS Trail running. This doesn't give me the support I need for my feet.
Asics,3,"I purchased these shoes solely (haha pun not intended) to wear around the house. I almost completely stopped wearing shoes in 2020 - because who leaves the house these days? My feet were getting really beat up walking around on hard floors all day, so I decided to get a new pair of shoes that I would wear exclusively indoors. The brand I usually order was no longer available on Amazon, so I tried these on a whim. They are well-made, matched the description, cute, and do the trick. The length of the shoe is accurate as is the width of the heel, but the toe area (width) is very tight (not exactly comfortable). I'm fine wearing them to walk around at home, but if I had purchased them for exercising or going out and about, they would probably be too uncomfortable, bordering on painful. I'm still giving these a 3 (which I consider a good score, just not great or excellent) because of that. They are size wide, so that shouldn't have been an issue. But I also realize my feet may have changed more than I realized during my year of no shoes. If width isn't an issue for the upper half of your feet, then I'm sure they'll work great and you'll love them."
Asics,3,"I purchased these to wear for work. I work on my feet on concrete floors 6 hours a day 5 days a week. The shoes were great to start, fit well and were comfortable but didn't last long. I just ordered a replacement yesterday, meaning these lasted just a little less than 3 months. They're not falling apart, just don't support my feet anymore."
Asics,3,"I purchased this pair of shoes 1 1/2 size too big, and they hurt like all out, I use them for walking and running, but in the toe area they really hurt, got runners toes from wearing them."
Asics,3,I read the reviews so I ordered one size up and they fit very well. The shoes are very comfortable but not made well. The threads around the toes on both shoes immediately came loose. I’m still wearing them but anticipate a whole on the right shoe at the toe. Should have been better than this
Asics,3,"I really like the colors and the design,  but my feet are a little wide and even the ""wide"" size fitted me.
I had with sorrow give them back, but if you have a more elegant feet I recommend them!"
Asics,3,"I really liked the appearance of these shoes! I ordered a size wide because I'm on my feet the entire time at work. They came in width E. Unfortunately, they were still too narrow. They seemed to be somewhat stiff but maybe they get better after being worn for awhile."
Asics,3,"I really liked these shoes except I couldn't feel any arch support. I have really high arches so maybe for someone who has normal arches they would be great. Unfortunately, I had to return them and find something else."
Asics,3,"I really wanted this shoe would be a better fit. I ordered my usual size, 7.5. I wear thin socks and have narrow feet and they are still very  tight in width. They’re just ok."
Asics,3,"I recently purchased ASICS Women’s gel venture 7 (size 7.5 Wide) for my wife. She loves the shoe but for some reason every time she wears them, after sometime, she develops a severe knee pain. She does not have this issue with any other shoe. Is it just us or did anyone report such an issue too ?"
Asics,3,I returned as they did not fit my foot.  Arch area was too tight.
Asics,3,"I returned this shoe.  I was looking for a good walking sneaker and these don’t have arch support so I had to return. Great show if your not looking for an arch support ( maybe better for working out, not walking)"
Asics,3,"I saw the price and the brand and was excited to have found this great deal. When I tried them on, the shoes felt just average. The gel feature of this pair is unimpressive. The soles of the shoes feel hard and do not have cushioned support.  The width of the ""wide"" shoes is okay."
Asics,3,"I should have ordered another 1/2 size bigger or a double wide rather than just wide - over $60 for shoes is a very big deal for me and they hurt my toes.  Had hoped to use them for walking and getting into shape but now, I won't be able to use these shoes.  Disappointed.  Should have bought them from a place where I could have tried them on since each shoe company's sizes differ slightly and there is no true ""one size"" that fits."
Asics,3,I sized up half a size like I do with all running shoes. These were still too short in the toe to run in. Comfortable everywhere else.
Asics,3,I stand up on my feet all day and I got them because it said great for walking. Not! My feet hurt so bad after working these did not work for me. Would not recommend
Asics,3,I thought they were going to be geat like my other asics ..they look like orthotic shoes ..hate them ! I have 6 other pairs of Asics and love them all
Asics,3,I thought they would of been more comfortable with the ortho-gel... not so much
Asics,3,"I tried these on and immediately thought they were wonderful, very comfy, supportive, great for walking on concrete all day. The next day I wore them to work. Sadly, these aren’t made quite right. My feet tend to slip forward inside these shoes while walking and I find myself constantly hitting the heel against the floor to reposition my foot in them. Anyone else been there? I’ve always thought it because the sole was just a bit out of whack. Too late to return... currently I am testing various insoles to try and stop the foot sliding problem. In the end I will probably just toss them."
Asics,3,I use it for walking but it didn’t offer the support I was looking for. My feet hurt after my long walks.
Asics,3,"I use these shoes for walking around the neighborhood.  Only problem is they are hard,  not soft like my previous running shoes.  Uncomfortable at times but well made.  Should last a while.  I use wide shoes and these are nice & roomy for my orthotic."
Asics,3,"I usually wear a 9.5 W. I ordered a 9.5w and they were too small and pinching at the toes. I returned and went up to a 10w and still have pinching at the toes. Was in need of new gym shoes, so I decided to just deal with the slight pinching I still had. Been wearing for about a month, the pinching in the toes is still there."
Asics,3,"I was disappointed that it didn’t have removable insoles so that I could insert my orthotics. The shoes are too tight, and a return label was somehow???? removed from the packing slip. So I am stuck with shoes that dont fit."
Asics,3,"I was looking to replace a pair of Asics that were Gel and had ortholite liner. I found these and thought I would try them. They fit well. I love the purple color I got. Good tread. However, the gel liner does not compare to my previous pair. I need some rebound due to bad knees, and the new Skechers GoWalk shoes no longer fit for some reason.  I found a pair of Asics with Gel and ortholite liner and they were perfect. That shoe was no longer available so I tried these. They are heavier which I think I expected as my other shoes were labeled Lyte, but the heel cushioning is just not there."
Asics,3,"I was told Asics are the best for being on your feet for 8 hours a day. After a couple hours they did not feel wide enough. Pinched my big toe and pinky. Kind of hard, stiff sneaker."
Asics,3,I was told by a friend that ASICS were the most comfortable shoe for being on your feet all day and she was right. They are very comfortable but wish I would have got the black and silver that I ordered. I ended up with navy blue and purple ones. My feet have been so sore that I didn’t want to take the time to send them back. I guess it’s best to go in a store so you get what you want.
Asics,3,"I was very excited about these shoes but the color did NOT come as expected. I ordered these thinking they would be much lighter than what actually came, based on the pictures provided online."
Asics,3,"I wear a wide-width shoe and I do not like them tightly laced. There is barely enough shoelace to tie into a bow. Otherwise, shoes are comfortable."
Asics,3,"I will say those with arches who intent on using this shoes to run, I would not recommend. After a mile, my feet are in serious pain and that’s mostly because the arch in my foot isn’t getting the support it needs."
Asics,3,"I wore ASICS  in my 20-30's and they were my favorite, for their arch support and sturdy construction.  However  I ordered maybe 3-4-5 different models thru Amazon, and not a single one had good arch support or felt like I could walk 10 miles, let alone walk around town.  Super not comfortable.  I did go to a local shoe store that is national chain, and tried on the same group of shoes, but found the same....low support and not comfotable.

I ended up going back to Nike for their support and cushioning.  So perhaps it's not Amazon, but the maker:)

I just don't have the patients to drive around miles or pay a million dollars for simple work out shoes.

If I was a marathon runner, or a serious athlete, yes, but as a daily exerciser just wanting to get moving to be healthy and keep fit, no.

Can't recommend :("
Asics,3,I worn the shoes today and received a lot of compliments. I like them very much. Thanks
Asics,3,"I’m a nurse and a long time ASICS fan. I’m on my feet 8-16 hours a day. Buy more expensive ASICS, not these. These are good enough for bumming- run to the grocery store, but not a long work day."
Asics,3,I’m not sure if these were a proper size 8. They are quite snug.
Asics,3,"I’m still on the fence with these shoes.  I bought them with the thought they would help my foot pain, but that hasn’t happened yet.  Perhaps with additional wearing."
Asics,3,"I’ve been looking for a sneaker similar to my new balance ones from a few yrs ago. New balance doesn’t seem to make their running shoes the same anymore and I’ve tried on and returned sooo many and even purchased at their store and hate them now.

Was recommended by someone to try out ASICS again for wide feet and these fit PERFECTTTTTLY. Soo comfy and walking and running outside has been great. So happy to find these and will probably order a second pair just in case these go out of stock too next year lol. Keep this model forever please don’t change a thing!!

Update: these started to really bother me in my pinky toes. So tight and irritate my foot sadly. Really disappointed because I thought I finally found a good shoe but this was only a few months of walking."
Asics,3,I’ve used ASICS for running and working as a nurse for years. For some reason these shoes really hurt my feet. I don’t know if it’sa new design but the seam across the top of the shoes are leaving blisters and pressure that hurts in general. I tried taking my orthotic soles out but it still rubs with every step.
Asics,3,"I’ve worn them a couple of days, still not sure of the comfort, have arthritis in right foot so have a lot of trouble not shoes fault"
Asics,3,I'e only had these shoes a week but they seem to perform well. My custom orthopedic inserts fit easily into my shoes I  walk 4 miles daily and am comfortable in my new shoes.
Asics,3,"I'm sure these shoes are fine for some people, but they were not a comfortable fit for me.  The soles were stiff and did not support my feet well.  I sent them back."
Asics,3,"It hurts the anterior part of my feet when I walk with it, not comfortable"
Asics,3,"It is a good sneaker. Nice support and color, but even with the 10W shoe, it is not that wide."
Asics,3,It is not very comfortable
Asics,3,"It looks good, is very comfortable for walking, great size fit, breathes well, but had no arch support. Asics is a good brand, but if you are looking to run in these shoes, go to the store and get custom fitted."
Asics,3,It’s fits uncomfortable and it’s not so comfortable
Asics,3,"I've always used Asics and loved the quality however, you can really notice the Chinese connection now...quality quite different than past.  I doubt they'll last near as long this round."
Asics,3,"I've always used ASICS for the support and comfort.  This pair is a CV little snug and not as comfortable, and I'm not sure why."
Asics,3,"I've been a fan of Asics for years because they are great for workouts, ru,nning and walking. They are also reasonably priced. But this pair has let me down. Three months in, the stitching on both toes began  disintegrating. By month 4, stitching wore out on the toes altogether. I've never had a shoe where the toe wears out before the sole. Looking for a replacement pair, but won't be purchasing Asics again."
Asics,3,"I've had these sneakers for a while now (so definitely broken in by now). I ordered my regular size 7, but the sneakers are uncomfortable to walk in. It feels like my toes are too cramped up front. I do however, like the way it looks."
Asics,3,Like the shoes but there's no arch and walking all day leaves my feet sore.  I always loved ASICS brand but will probably be switching as it's nearly impossible to find that soft sole with an arch in this brand.
Asics,3,"Love ASICS- they are my favorite choice of footwear, I buy a pair at least once a year.  However, these shoes were described as black & silver.  Clearly they are dark blue.  (My pants are black for reference.)
Again, excellent fit and comfort- but not the right color!"
Asics,3,Love the comfort. I just found out that they are a bit small but nothing drastic
Asics,3,Loved them when I first got them. But after a few months of wearing them to walk 2-3 miles a few times a week they lost their bounce.
Asics,3,"Maybe these shoes just need to be broke in a bit, but they’re not comfortable or fit well.

I ordered a half size larger then what I normally wear, and they’re still too tight, and not at all comfortable."
Asics,3,"Me encantaron, Justo lo que quería"
Asics,3,Meh. They are fine. Fit as expected. Not as supportive as I’d expected.
Asics,3,muy bonitos pero muy duros en la suela. falta amortiguación. lastima
Asics,3,"My feet still hurt, didn’t find them to have much cushion."
Asics,3,My wife loves the look I miss you but find it is smaller then the actual size a very tight on her instep. She has only one than once
Asics,3,Nice color & fit.  Seemed cheaply made in comparison to other ASICS I have AND the newer shoe strings are awfully skinny & cheap not appropriate for athletic shoes.
Asics,3,"Nice fit, wide model is more noisy when you run/walk than regular width for some reason...."
Asics,3,Nice looking but ordered wide width and are not wide at all also no arch support at all
Asics,3,Nice looking shoe but in my opinion it’s not a true wide shoe.
Asics,3,"Nice looking shoes, but run a bit small."
Asics,3,"Nice shoes but caused major issues with my heel/achilles. I suffer from tendon issues so I need to wear inserts. The inner height of the shoe did not permit and wearing the shoes without them caused pain. At first I thought it was a breaking in period, but running daily for 6 weeks was not enough. Unfortunately so, because Runner's World said this shoe was awesome."
Asics,3,"Nice shoes, but run small especially in the toes. I have gotten a lot of asics thru the mail, and have always been great, but these were made small"
Asics,3,Nice shows but not as comfortable as Saucony. I bought 8.5 and they fit just right.
Asics,3,No arch support
Asics,3,No cute light colored Asics shoes this year. All shoes have grey and black.....I like a lighter shoe for summer. This is all Asics....not Amazons fault. I looked everywhere.
Asics,3,No son cómodas
Asics,3,Not a true to size - smaller than a normal size 8
Asics,3,Not as comfortable as I expected. The design and color are awesome.
Asics,3,"Not comfy , too big & just cheaply made"
Asics,3,"Not like other ASICS , cheaply made"
Asics,3,Not much arch support for the money. Wont get them again
Asics,3,"Not much gel.  Had to buy Dr. Scholl's gel inserts and took out the plain ones.  These Asics not as wide as my other wide width shoes near the toe. Light weight yes, as comfortable as my other asics, no."
Asics,3,Not that comfortable. Does not look like it does in photograph.
Asics,3,Not very flexible! But ok!! Not the best quality either.
Asics,3,"Not very wide for a supposedly wide shoe, but trying to make them work.  Does not have the support I was hoping for, but solid soles and nice laces."
Asics,3,Not worth the amount of money seen these shoes for less .
Asics,3,"Obvious the right shoe had been tried on and worn. Visible dirt on sole. Wanted to return for a new pair, as I like the style and fit but, it was going to cost me $11 to return. Not worth it. Sad there was no quality check for this."
Asics,3,order up
Asics,3,Ordered black and gray received different color.  If the price hasn’t  increased since purchasing and hassle of exchanging I would have sent back for color ordered.  Fit is true to size and shoes are comfortable overall
Asics,3,"Ordered the 8.5 wide. The width was great, the insole was comfortable, but the toe box was very small. I have previously order the gel venture 5 and loved them. Decided to try the 7 this time. They narrow down significantly toward the toes."
Asics,3,Ordered up a size and was too harow for my foot.
Asics,3,Pretty comfortable shoe so far. Just got them. Love the look
Asics,3,"PROS:
Correct sizing!!! Order your size!
Perfect for moderate walking.
Wider toe-box: very nice!
Structure of the shoe kept me from rolling my foot: not just mesh.
Moderate cushioning: on the firmer side.
Durable insole: no pilling or tearing.
Looks exactly as pictured: Authentic product with Company Tag.
NO MEMORY FOAM, thank goodness!

CONS:
Not recommended for running due to minimal cushioning.
Wider heels than expected.
Has no arch support despite having a molded sole.
The heel tab is a bit stiff and can cause blisters.
Stiff sole: personal opinion.

GOOD beginner walking shoe but if you walk more than one mile a day, you'll need inserts.
I have shin splits and bad joints so it could just be me, but here's my take on these shoes.

I give it 4 stars for being better than Avia and New Balance."
Asics,3,Quality just okay for money.  Probably would have returned them except the color was what I really wanted.
Asics,3,"Really liked the fit, and helped my plantar fasciitis. But I have only had these maybe a little over a month and the stitching on the toe border is already coming undone, and it looks like the cloth material is separating from the front of my shoe where the toes are. I only wear them to work. Very disappointing."
Asics,3,Really tight/narrow around the toes. Wish I wouldn’t of gone a half size bigger.
Asics,3,"Returned actually,  not what I anticipated."
Asics,3,Running
Asics,3,Runs small and narrow
Asics,3,Runs small. Wide around ankle. Order a 1/2 size up.
Asics,3,"Seem very hard, my feet ache after wearing them all day.
Stiff, not like my other ASICS, which are my brand of choice."
Asics,3,"Sent them back.  Not much padding in ball of feet.  Good fit and support, just needs more padding."
Asics,3,Shoe felt great at first but not good for long periods of being on your feet. An eight hour work day and my feet were hurting
Asics,3,Shoe laces are really cheap. Shouldnt last very ling. Shoes run small.
Asics,3,"Shoe was comfortable and looked nice, but these soles totally wore through after less than 5 months of wear. Not running or playing sport, just walking."
Asics,3,"Shoes aren’t as comfy as I expected, wore a couple times but now I can’t send them back and I don’t wear them"
Asics,3,Size runs small and I expected more comfort
Asics,3,"Sneakers were very pretty and stylish but ran way too small my toes were painfully at the top of shoe could not wear with my medical condition & R.A , would buy again in larger size . Very stable shoe to walk in."
Asics,3,Started coming apart a week after wearing them
Asics,3,"Tengo 45 años soy talla 11 mujer , mido 178 cm y peso 65 kilos. Vivo en Chile y aquí no venden zapatos de vestir ni zapatillas de mujer de mi talla  por lo que toda mi vida he usado los 365 días del año solamente zapatillas de hombre de marcas nike, brooks y últimamente mis favoritas las adidas boost pero no las fabrican en horma ancha y el juanete que tengo en el pie derecho a crecido por lo que una horma normal aunque me caben me irritan un poco la piel por lo que estoy buscando algo mas holgado.

Estoy agradecida de que algunas buenas marcas ahora estén haciendo zapatillas de mujer  anchos y de tallas grandes con diseños y colores bonitos como estos pero esperaba algo un poco mas blando. Quizás este modelo para los pronadores puede ser adecuada. Debo decir que son muy pero muy  duras para sel uso continuo que yo les doy. La plantilla esta pegada y el ancho extra no es tanto como para poder poner mis propias plantillas insole sobre las fijas que trae. Compre talla 11 wide de mujer. Quizás  las 9 y medio wide  de hombre hubieran tenido mas espacio interior pero en dureza seguro es la misma.
Calientan un poco los pies después de un rato pero para climas fríos están bien.
Son livianas.

 Las recibí ayer por lo que no me puedo pronunciar respecto a la calidad de su construcción pero su agarre en pavimento mojado y senderos de grava es muy bueno y a simple vista su construcción no presenta defectos.

Solo quisiera agregar que para la gente que requiere zapatos anchos  estos  interiormente  en la punta son apenas un poquito mas anchos que los normales y el (alto) espacio sobre las uñas tampoco es mayor.
 Junto a estas compre unas zapatillas saucony 11 wide y allí se noto que eran wide mi pie quedo holgado  en su interior. Tanto en el ancho en la punta como en el espacio sobre los dedos por lo que aunque su plantilla original al igual que esta es fija les pude poner una plantilla sobre esta.
 En estas entre mi hueso y la zapatilla no queda casi espacio pero por lo menos aunque sin mis plantillas por ahora las puedo usar aunque me presionan un poco los dedos para bajo.

Creo que ahora probare con unas new balance."
Asics,3,"The arch support seemstob in the wrong place. Not sure I'm li king the gel, either."
Asics,3,"The last two pairs of Asics I have purchased feel different from the originals Asics running shoes, in that they are quite stiff, heavy, and inflexible. The older models felt like a glove from day one! These feel stiff and hot after wearing them for a while. I am not sure why the design and feel of the shoe is different. I never bought the very expensive ones, only the ones around $40 to $50.00. So, it can't be a matter of price. I am disappointed that the shoe design may have changed. I will wear them, but I kept the others until there were holes in them, for they felt like a cloud!"
Asics,3,"The product color descriptions are incorrect. In my case, the Black/silver appears to be navy and it IS; which was fine with me, b/c I wanted navy and took a chance. That said, there is nothing special about the footbed here. I think the size is accurate. I am a 10M and the 10M fits. If you need wide, though, you better order wide. I do not wear a wide, but there is no extra space here either. I may return and upgrade to a gel-nimbus for better support."
Asics,3,The product described was not as expected but I really like this brand so I'll keep them.
Asics,3,The reviews said they run small but I disagree.  I went up half a size and I should NOT have.  Also I don’t like how puffy the tongue of the shoe is and the small laces look silly with the puffy tongue.  They are comfy so I’ll keep them but I’ll prob go to a shoe store next time to try shoes on before I buy them on amazon again.
Asics,3,"the right shoe was way to big, I thought the sent 2 different sizes. I think they were mistaken."
Asics,3,The right sneaker was tight the left was too perfect
Asics,3,The shoe fit in length at my size 8 1/2. But it was Narrow across the foot and gave me pain in my toes. I ended up donating it to a church. I thought it was a nice looking shoe. I have not had to order a wide in any other shoes that I wear. Therefore I think this shoe is cut too small.
Asics,3,"The shoe fits small for itsize and is lacking comfort.  The shoe strings are too short even at 48 inches  and tthey are very thin. If you buy the shoe I recommend getting different shoe strings as these are way too short and not very thick and sturdy. The shoe itself just okay. The comfort in the heel is alright but the forefoot is extremely tight.  If your feet tend to be on the wider side in the forefoot I suggest getting a wide fitting shoe. My feet are somewhat in the middle of regular and wide and the shoe I found to be very tight.

Overall it seems sturdy in design with the exception of the strings. Good balance and the bottom of the shoe doesn't catch which is good."
Asics,3,The shoe has minimal cushion and arch support. These are not near as comfortable as previous styles.
Asics,3,The shoes did not feel as good as I hoped they would.
Asics,3,"The shoes felt a slightly bigger than normal fit of size 7 Asics.  I thought the laces felt too thin, uncomfortable across the bridge of my foot when tied tight.  I changed them out for thicker laces from an old pair of Asics which made them more comfortable to wear."
Asics,3,The shoes look good and are made well but honestly not very comfortable at all.  I had to put my own inserts in.  Not very supportive and pretty hard on my feet
Asics,3,The shoes ran small. The cushion caused movement in my foot within the shoe that was causing it to rub against the ankle. Very cushiony but would be problematic for getting blisters.
Asics,3,The toe box is nice and wide but it doesn't taper to the back so your ankle does slip out.
Asics,3,The wife has had these same ones before and was happy. This time the inside was uncomfortable. She said it was coming apart. Tried to contact manufacturer and no response.
Asics,3,"There is a crack on the toe of one shoe. I still wear them, but not happy about the defect."
Asics,3,"There isn't as much arch support as I need. I think that if arch support isn't something that you are hyper focused on, this shoe will be great. For me, it leaves me too flat footed."
Asics,3,There okay for the $$.
Asics,3,"These are great walking shoes, haven't tried running in them yet. However, from just a few walks, the bottom of the shoe easily accumulates dirt (even from walking on concrete sidewalks) and it is a burden to remove each time. We don't get much rain/mud in CA, so if you live in a wet area, I definitely do not recommend buying.

Overall, it's a comfortable pair of shoes without a need to ""break in"", but be warned about bringing the shoes back into your house after wearing due to the bottom of it being very dirty."
Asics,3,"These are made in Vietnam. I agree with other reviewers that the laces are short, thin and come untied easily. The charcoal and burgundy color I got is very nice looking. But even with an extra support insert my heel hurts. I don’t think they are genuine ASICS."
Asics,3,These are not a wide width.. I  gave them to  my daughter who wears a regular width and  fit her perfect
Asics,3,These are not running but all terrain.
Asics,3,"These are really good running/walking shoes, but they run about a half size short.  I wear a 6 1/2 or 7 in other shoes, but needed a 7 1/2 in these."
Asics,3,"These are terribly uncomfortable, zero arch support, and the heel constantly slips while I’m walking or running. I’ve tried all the tricks. Sole inserts, lacing different ways with different techniques, heel inserts for slippage, you name it. Just awful. And I’m really sad about it because they are sooo cute. Oh well."
Asics,3,These don’t fit the same comfy way prior iterations have. They give me blisters.
Asics,3,"These have been my ""go to"" shoes and this order was the 4th time I have purchased them..  I have noticed a real cheapening of the quality in this pair - from flimsy shoelaces (really they are just string), fewer grommets, wider heel cups so they don't fit as well.  Very disappointed."
Asics,3,These run a half size small.  I wear a 8.5 and needed a 9 instead. What I didn’t like about them is the very cheap looking laces. I returned because I would hav needed to replace them with something a bit more athletic. They are very thin/flat type laces
Asics,3,"These shoes are less attractive than they seem from the picture, bulky, and less comfortable than I expected. I don’t hate them, but I’m certainly not excited about wearing them either. It was my contribution to somewhat coordinating walking attire with my significant other. Oops. The man version looks great on him. Go figure!"
Asics,3,These shoes are pretty good but the laces are TERRIBLE. They are so slippery that they constantly come untied just from walking around throughout the day. I have to double knot them and sometimes they still wiggle loose!
Asics,3,"These shoes are very light, but they have no arch support. Returning these."
Asics,3,"These shoes look really good, and they fit well.  But after a mile or so my feet hurt a lot more than they do in other shoes.  :("
Asics,3,"These were super cute, however, the fit is very narrow. My feet are regular size. I recommend these for people with narrow feet. Other than that super cute shoes, I kept them because I love the look, however, I can only wear them briefly, before they start hurting my feet."
Asics,3,They are cut way too narrow. Thats why I order diabetic shoes.She need xx wided for her foot and brace to fit in the shoe.
Asics,3,They are not a standard size 10 shoe. They fit small.
Asics,3,"They are not really wide width as described in ad. I am normally able to get away with regular width,but I like having room for thick socks in the winter. They are a bit snug for that but I do still like them."
Asics,3,"They are not the same color as in the picture that I ordered from . They are gray and black
I wanted the blue ones in the picture that shows the blue ones with the black and grey Description"
Asics,3,They are smaller than the real size
Asics,3,They are very comfortable. True fit
Asics,3,They did not have the support I needed but I managed. Would not be recommending these if you have problems with your feet hurting from walking.
Asics,3,They didn't give a lot of support and they are not that appealing to the eye
Asics,3,They feel very cheap.
Asics,3,"They looks cute
wish I would’ve sized half size up or gotten a wider size!"
Asics,3,"This is a well crafted shoe with a lot of support.  Unfortunately for me, I returned them since my foot was too wide.  My pinky toe rubbed pretty bad  so I couldn’t keep them.  I loved the design and color though."
Asics,3,This is my second pair of the similar shoe and the first pair I had for way too long but they were the best shoes.  These are not comfortable and I had to add arch support.
Asics,3,"This is my umpteenth Asics and while some are in 9 and some work better in 9.5, this shoe fits the left foot perfectly and is too small on the right foot. Since I only found out after a run in the park (I had to take out the insole) I couldn’t return the shoe."
Asics,3,"This shoe is a disappointment after wearing the Venture 5 for years. I have skinny, long and narrow feet; most Asics shoes usually have great support and fit well through the middle of the foot. The Venture 5 also has a slightly narrow heel (which is also difficult to find in tennis/trail shoes).  The Venture 7 is bigger all over (in the same size I usually wear in the Venture 5) and my heel slides out as well.  There is virtually no cushion to speak of and the overall design is different. I am so glad Amazon allows returns on these! I usually buy two pairs at a time and will leave the second pair in the box when it arrives. The color on this shoe is really pretty, however, and I am so sorry I have to return them."
Asics,3,This shoe is a little tight especially around the toes. It may stretch after time but it’s uncomfortable.
Asics,3,This shoe is much narrower than all of the rest of my Asics shoes
Asics,3,"This shoe is so comfortable! I walk around 3-4 miles everyday at work, and my feet do not ache at all by the end of my 12hr shifts. However, the shoe does not feel durable enough to last more than a year. It has already started to lose its shape a bit, after a few months of wearing it."
Asics,3,"This shoe is very sold, but it was too hard for me.  It also ran a bit small, I am normally a 7 & 1/2 to 8, I ordered an 8 and while it was plenty wide, my toes were at the end."
Asics,3,"This shoe was a great price, but it’s not very sturdy. The sole is stiff and has very little shock absorption. The shape doesn’t conform to the foot well, so it looks bulky around the center to toe area. It’s comfortable enough for light walks or running errands, but doesn’t have enough structure  for more intensive athletic activities. The colors are nice though. I wanted these for long walks, light hikes, and maybe some aerobics, but they’re not going to cut it. They’re not really cute enough to wear as fashion sneakers either."
Asics,3,"This state black and silver, but the entire shoe is a dark-bluish purple..  Takes time to get use to... I'm still trying to after awhile now....  Ok, so they sit in my closet because of it.
Side note: the size 9 fits well"
Asics,3,"This was listed, even on the shoe label as wide width. Still rather tight."
Asics,3,Thought there would be more cushion inside shoe. I got wide width and they run small. Still should be bit wider.
Asics,3,Tight git
Asics,3,"Tight, should have sized up and got wide. Bought them for my 10 yr old daughter in size 5. They colors are want she wanted but they are a bit pricey for the quality. Probably wouldn't buy again unless they were on discount."
Asics,3,To small
Asics,3,Too small
Asics,3,Too tight on toes. Painful after walking 5 miles.
Asics,3,Uhhhh these are definite blue not black.
Asics,3,"Unfortunately I did not look at the reviews before I purchased because I ONLY wear Asics.  I was excited when I saw lavender, named Piedmont Gray.  When I received them, they are black.  I do not want solid black.  Why are you showing them as lavender?  So very dissappointed!!"
Asics,3,"Update - they did refund my money.
_______________________

Edit- I've had these shoes for six weeks. I walk (seriously, walk at 3.5) on a treadmill, and I now have a hole in the back of the shoe. Am I doing something wrong or are the shoes fake?

Taking my stars away.
_____________

 I like to buy ASICS because they have a large toe box, and I have very wide feet. I had a pair of GEL-Cumulus that has wonderful arch support. I bought the the GEL-Venture because they  were cheaper. My mistake.  I should have paid more for the Cumulus to get the arch support because these shoes are almost flat inside. I'm also disappointed with the back of the shoe. It is very soft and often curls in.  I hoped this would mean that I wouldn't wear holes in the shoes with my heals, but the fabric is starting to wear.

They are cute, wide, light shoes. If you don't need to wear them for long, they are fine. If you need arch support, buy the Cumulus."
Asics,3,"Update: I ended up ordering an 8.5 wide and the box says 8.5 wide. I tried the shoe on and it was super tight again like the last pair I ordered and realized that the shoe inside was only an 8 wide. So apparently somebody did a switcheroo. And the shoes also looked used. So not very happy with my purchase from Amazon this time. I still love Asics shoes but I wish I would have been able to try on the size I ordered.

These were way too small. I did not notice other people mentioning to order a half size up from your normal size. I have bought Asics for probably the past 10 years and this is the first time they did not fit. Guess I'll send them back and try the next size up. They were pretty tight in the toe area."
Asics,3,Very comfortable but they squeak when you walk. Also the shoe laces need to be much longer.
Asics,3,Very comfortable to walk with but definitely not made for running.
Asics,3,Very nice shoes but a bit narrow
Asics,3,Was too small had to return & got refund. Ordered next size up
Asics,3,What good are running shoes without any arch support?  I will be returning them.
Asics,3,When I opened the package and open the box there were long hair all in the shoes. They were not new pair of shoes
Asics,3,"Whoever typed up the Amazon post must be color blind. I ordered the black/silver and they are navy blue with light purple trim. They actually match the photo, the description does not."
Asics,3,Wide In the front. I was expecting more cushion.. i live the color.
Asics,3,"Wish they kept the design of venture 6! These are missing the reinforced toe, extra cushion and support that I like to have for hiking and running. If you just need for walking or light gym sneakers they will do the trick still!
Really disappointed in the quality and will be returning for older model."
Asics,3,"With these shoes I actually had to order a half size larger, which is odd for me but not a big deal.  They have some arch support for my high arches but not as much as I'd hoped.  The biggest thing I noticed was that they seem somewhat hard.  This was the deal breaker for me as I need shoes to provide cushion for my feet when I'm standing around for awhile."
Asics,3,Wore shoe about 4 months with light use a couple times a week and only indoors. The stitching has come out on the right shoe where the leather meets the mesh. I am very unhappy about this. I liked how they fit and they were very comfortable . The stitching should have been better than this and other pairs of this brand have never had this problem.
New_Balance,3,Adding an additional insole with arch support helped.  I have to lace up pretty tight to not step out of them.  cute style. no real support.
New_Balance,3,"Adorable shoe but I find New Balance run small. I would size up 1/2 size. My toes are right against the front. For my foot, they were a tad wide.  I used the laces to tighten it but then it gathered the fabric in a weird way & looked strange bc they’re designed to be able to slip on. Would be good if you have a medium to wide foot, not narrow. Sadly had to return."
New_Balance,3,"After less than 6 months of only casual (pandemic) use both shoes have holes at the toes. They are comfortable and very easy to get on/off,  but don’t last."
New_Balance,3,Although I've worn New Balance shoes before this style runs smaller than expected (about a half size). I will continue to wear them for short outings & such but cannot wear them for my 12 hour work shifts I purchased them for.
New_Balance,3,"Although these are cute and fit the bill of what I was looking for, I guess I should have realized these would have no arch support. The shoe liner is also very thin. I will remove the thin liner and replace it with something more substantial. Otherwise, they fit as expected."
New_Balance,3,"Always wear a 9 in this brand, these were a half size too small. Sent back. Maybe just me but New Balance seems less well made than in the past."
New_Balance,3,"As a nurse these shoes were great briefly. They are incredibly light and comfortable, but unfortunately do not provide adequate support for my hard-worked feet. They feel worn down already only after a handful of shifts."
New_Balance,3,At first fits snug so I kept half size bigger but now they feel lose so its disappointing as I cant return them. But now I know for next time.
New_Balance,3,"At first they feel very comfortable, however, they more they are used the less comfortable they become. They do not have good support and are painful to workout in."
New_Balance,3,"At the recommendation of my niece, I bought my first pair a couple of years and ordered 1/2 size larger as she said they ran small. I loved this shoe! A few weeks ago I ordered another pair the same size and they were too large. They also came in a plastic bag as opposed to a box. The shoes just weren’t the same and I even wondered if they were a knockoff. No problem returning them."
New_Balance,3,"Barely fits. I ordered a 8.5 wide as usual.  My toes are at the end of the shoe.  Also, very flat sole."
New_Balance,3,"Based on info in other reviews, I Ordered two sizes for fit. 8 and 8.5. Don’t know which one this is. I wear a 7.5 to 8. I ended up keeping the 8.5. I have a really difficult time wearing Sneakers- I am picky and my feet and body hate shoes. I literally hurt all over wearing them. My daughter bought these to wear when she returned to teaching after a long break and recommended. They are ok. Probably better than that for most. I like they aren’t heavy but the snugness has me kicking them off pretty quickly after a walk. I have a hard time pulling them on. The back heel crumples and I have to pull off and start over. But. My one and on,y big complaint is the memory foam insole that is “glued” in. I have had these for a month and obviously haven’t worn them a lot. That insole has come undone halfway which means it crumples and wads up when shoe is taken off and has to be pressed back in before wearing again. Meanwhile, it is warped and uncomfortable. So if I have to remove shoe and start over when the back heel crumples putting them on  the insole drags out  as well and have to fix that. I’ve removed the insole and hunting a better one. Meanwhile, Shoe is a pain to wear. Won’t purchase this or any other shoe with memory foam insole ever again."
New_Balance,3,Beautiful design. Each shoe fit me differently which has never happened before. Not much support had to return. Love the look though.
New_Balance,3,"Being New Balance, I thought these would be cute casual sneakers for summer that would supportmy feet. I have worn these twice while running errands. Poor support immediately, especially if you have any foot problems. They are cute though."
New_Balance,3,Bought these for a parade and they are too tight .
New_Balance,3,"Bought this shoe for my wife and she's run in them a couple of times. Shoe fits as expected, but they're a little loose when running; laces could be placed differently for more snug fit. Overall, decent running shoe."
New_Balance,3,Buy a half a size bigger. They fit a little too snugly for my liking.
New_Balance,3,Comfortable  and supportive.  Really happy I bought them.
New_Balance,3,"Comfortable shoe but the insert folds and foam shreds after more than one machine wash.
I use these shoes for work and they last about six months working 3 shifts/week on my feet.
 Wish they lasted longer!
I have used a second pair for running and sometimes they give blisters. Definitely need to order larger size because they run small.
Comfortable for feet with bunions due to soft material/nothing constricting."
New_Balance,3,Comfy & cool. A bit tight on top bit it's ok.
New_Balance,3,Comfy and light wear.
New_Balance,3,"Comfy, true to size, & very stylish."
New_Balance,3,Construction is off: shoe lace is sticking out of seem. There’s a seam across the top that can be felt as it isn’t lined. However arch support is great. Use for indoor exercise. We will see how they how up. My expectations are pretty low at this point.
New_Balance,3,Cute and comfortable but can be worn down quickly i after wearing multiple times.
New_Balance,3,Cute but fits true to size. Suggest buying a size and a half up. Return for a larger size.
New_Balance,3,Cute but not comfortable for long
New_Balance,3,Cute but not meant for any sort of activity. These have absolutely no support.
New_Balance,3,"Cute but run a little small, I would go up in size."
New_Balance,3,"Cute for style, not for running. No ankle support. For style, you need really low socks."
New_Balance,3,"Cute shoe - especially since I have big feet so my shoes generally look like mens shoes.  Very lightweight and I'd say they would be comfy but there is zero arch support.  I bought these to take my my dog on walks so after trying them on and walking only a few steps I knew they would not work and back they went.  Too bad, they are a very attractive shoe!  😟"
New_Balance,3,"Cute shoe and seems comfy when they are in, but I find them super hard to get on my feet as the opening seems narrow. I normally do not have this issue, so these will be going back."
New_Balance,3,Didn’t fit like a typical NB shoe.
New_Balance,3,"Don’t ever stop making this shoe. Like every other shoe now day, it does wear out within 6 months, but they’re so comfortable. It’s worth a replacement....."
New_Balance,3,Don’t get for work shoes. They are not slip resistant and I fell multiple times( I am a server)
New_Balance,3,Eh underwhelmed and too small. But for the price it might work for you.
New_Balance,3,Even the wide was super narrow mid foot.  I felt like I was stepping on something.  Say day.  Returned.
New_Balance,3,"even tho I take W width, this was too wide"
New_Balance,3,Extremely narrow
New_Balance,3,Feel pretty cheap but considering the price I paid they are great for running to the store or heading of a day out with my kids. I wouldn’t use them for any kind of training.
New_Balance,3,"Feels like you step into foam when you put your foot in and ultimately is probably very comfy but my toe is at the very top of shoe which is a little uncomfortable and sometimes the elastic strap is too tight around the foot, would recommend going atleast a half size up."
New_Balance,3,"First I will say I didn’t fully read the description, I guess, because I didn’t realize they are not a traditional lace-up-with-tongue style. Although the laces do somewhat help to tighten the shoe, they’re stitched on over a solid surface, not an opening like you’d normally see where laces or Velcro are involved. That’s kind of annoying but ultimately works fine.

The fabric for the color I got (medium-dark heather grey, I think it’s called Carbon) is kinda stretchy and weird. Breathable and definitely not going to keep your feet dry but it’s a comfortable fabric. I’ve worn these shoes without socks once or twice so far and I like that the fabric is soft and there are no seams inside to wrinkle on my toes! :)

They do not seem to have great arch support BUT they are still comfortable and even without fancy inserts. I purchased a wide so there is room for my custom orthotics, so I’m happy enough with the support now.

I don’t normally order wide width shoes although I do prefer my shoes rounded and a bit wide through the ball of foot & toe area. Based on some other reviews that complained the shoe was too small, I ordered not a longer size but a WIDER size than normal. I’m very glad I did."
New_Balance,3,First pair of New Balances. Love the shoes but they’re too small. I wear the same size in every other brand of sneaker. I’d go at least 1/2 size up. I’ll be exchanging for a bigger size.
New_Balance,3,First these really are adorable.  Extremely lightweight.  You can feel the breeze through them.  Problem is I bought them for a trip to Disney.  We walked an average of 7 miles per day. These were not nearly sturdy enough for that. You could feel every crack and bump you went over.  My feet were killing me after an hour. Luckily I had another pair of ASIC running shoes with me. I only wore them to the Merry Christmas Party and that was it.  I also bought the children’s version for my daughter (age 9). And she said the same thing and she wears New Balance all the time.  They are good for day to day stuff but not for significant walking.
New_Balance,3,Fit perfect for my siZe! And I don’t usually buy shoes online because I get nervous the size won’t fit properly. Extremely comfortable. Especially for running
New_Balance,3,"Fit small and very narrow. Looked like nice quality shoes but I returned due to the size. I normally wear an 8.5, but due to other reviews I ordered a 9, and even then they were uncomfortable- I would have needed a 9.5 or even possibly 10 for these shoes to work for me. Nice shoes just beware of the need to size up a full size at least."
New_Balance,3,"Fit Small I normally wear a 7.5/8 I ordered the 8 and that was to small I’ve never had to order an 8.5 before but all in all very comfortable shoe . I’m going to Peru and didn’t have time to wait they sell these at Dillars, I’m happy I found them!! The reason I took away stars was for the fit and the shoe that was delivered to me was dirty."
New_Balance,3,Fits more like an 8 than 8.5W. Mesh top is somewhat see through.  If you wear any other color sock besides white you can see a color difference on the outside
New_Balance,3,"Fits slightly bigger. I’ve gotten these exact shoes before (but on the website not Amazon) and a size 6 fit perfectly, now I had to return the 6 and go down to 5.5, but they’re still not as comfortable as the others. I got the black on black. I like this shoe but I wonder if when bought from
Amazon the fit options are different. Comfort level is just OK, in the past they’ve been my go to shoe for EVERYTHING - walking - gym - errands - but these killed the top of my foot after a little bit of jump roping."
New_Balance,3,"Fits smaller than I expected. I’ve never fluctuated in shoe size. I have pretty large feet and these are a tad bit too small and it makes my toes hurt. They are cute, but very cheap. I would recommend doing up half a size if you can."
New_Balance,3,"For the seller: The shoes have already been worn! Maybe just once and then returned, They are still in like new condition but you can see the dirt in the crevices and on the side. I shouldn’t be paying full price for a pair of shoes that somebody obviously wore!

The shoe: I kept them as they were going to get worn anyway.
Very light weight, narrow, comfortable for walking but not a good High intensity workout shoe. After a few hours I was ready to take them off, pinching toes.
The look, Very cute and stylish!"
New_Balance,3,gave to sister as feet too swllen to use. looks good if would fit
New_Balance,3,Go a size larger
New_Balance,3,"Go up a size. Too small for me. I’ve never bought a size nine before but I had to for these. Besides that, I liked them"
New_Balance,3,Good price but I wore these for two 10 hour hospital shifts and  one of the soles broke down and now they squeak when I walk.  They are comfortable but they didn’t hold up and they are too loud for night shift.
New_Balance,3,Good shoe
New_Balance,3,Good shoe but definitely made for people that have skinny feet. Do not get these if you had wide feet. Other than that they were comfy
New_Balance,3,"Good shoes, buttery domt get very good traction. And the top is wide but the sole is narrow."
New_Balance,3,"Got these for work because they stated they were good for healthcare on one of my Facebook pages, and while they are cute and comfy, they are not great for all day wear. I like them I just wouldn't recommend them if you're on your feet all day."
New_Balance,3,"Got these just for walking on my lunch hour at work. Nice, low profile shoe for the cost. If you're planning on running might want to order half a size bigger as they seem to run a little short."
New_Balance,3,Great comfort but I have to pull the shoelaces so right in order for it to properly support my foot.
New_Balance,3,Great fit but soles squeak after a few weeks of wearing.  Bought 2 different pairs at two different time and they squeak where the sole bends at the toes.  Very sad because I love new balance and have worn them for many years. Not sure if it is bad design or quality of materials
New_Balance,3,Great looking shoe but very narrow toe box.
New_Balance,3,"Great looking, but hurt my foot immediately."
New_Balance,3,"Great shoe for walking. Insole is memory foam so there is no arch support and they do get stinky after multiple uses. The sole is not very grooved so if you are walking in rain or snow, you slip around."
New_Balance,3,Great shoe! BUT I ordered a .5 size to small not realizing the shoe runs a tad small and I tried to exchange for a .5 size bigger and I am unable to. Now I have wasted $40 on a shoe I cannot exchange for the correct size. Definitely disappointed by that.
New_Balance,3,Great shoe! Im an ER nurse and these stand the test of time. We are all buying them.
New_Balance,3,"Great shoe, I like the elastic band and the shoe strings for a nice snug fit when your jumping."
New_Balance,3,"Great shoe, that runs small at toe box. I went up a half size, a whole size would have been absolutely too big."
New_Balance,3,Had to order twice they run very small..
New_Balance,3,Had to return. For a wide shoe. I'm a 9.5 exactly somewhat moderate arch with what I dont believe is narrow feet. So I will try the wide in this. Seems to fit nicely now. I'm not too sure of the support though. I'd give it a 2 for comfort.
New_Balance,3,Had to return. These run 1/2-1 size small.
New_Balance,3,Have bought this shoe twice before and loved it just runs a little smaller now. Tried the next size up and was too big! So still trying g to find a good shoe to replace this
New_Balance,3,Have had similar brand of these shoes... the sizes don't seem to match for some reason.
New_Balance,3,"Have ordered this model shoe for the last several years and suddenly it is too small.  I’m not sure what is going on with NB, but their sizing in this year’s line of shoes is far smaller than in the past.  I had to return this pair and also a pair of NB shoes that I ordered for my husband."
New_Balance,3,"Heel of shoe much bigger than overall shoe.  Heel slipped off, can't use for walking.  They are going back"
New_Balance,3,"I absolutely LOVE these shoes! The fit is perfect, and the style is great. I have one huge problem. The left shoe squeaks really bad when I walk. It didn't start right away. It was probably a few weeks into wearing them. I don't wear them daily either. I thought I'd stepped in gum or something sticky, but it isn't on the bottom of the shoe. It seems to be coming from the sole. I've tried taking the sole out to see what it is, but nothing helps. It is really frustrating because other than that, these shoes are perfect. I'm scared to order another pair because I'm worried that they will do the same thing."
New_Balance,3,"I absolutely love these shoes, however I’m disappointed in the quality of the product. I’ve had these shoes for 21 days now. I work out every single day, and the soles are already worn out and the one side is already peeling up.

Aside from the sole, they are comfortable, breathable, and true to size. They didn’t give me that “new shoe hurt” when breaking them in."
New_Balance,3,"I already have a pair of these sneakers in another color which I purchased from Dick's Sporting Goods.  I ordered these because it was the only place I could find a black pair in my size (8 wide).  These were wider than the ones I purchased at Dick's, so they were a little bit loose.  The main problem is that the color of the fabric part of the sneaker doesn't match the sole.  The fabric seems to have a bit of a blue tint.  You may not be able to tell much when someone is just walking by, but when you look closely, it's there.  Not something I want to spend money on.  I plan to return these.
I assume they are comfortable since I already have them in another color, but I didn't wear this specific pair."
New_Balance,3,"I always wear a 9 & these are more like an 8 1/2, I can't wear them and, sadly, missed the return window. Cute, tho."
New_Balance,3,I am a 6.5 in all other shoes...consistently.  I got these today...strangely wide in the toes but then too small and the tips of my toes feel squished and pushed down. Size up a half size or try in in the store first!
New_Balance,3,I am a 9.5 in women shoes. I read reviews and bought a 10. My toe hits the tip of the shoe still on the 10 size. I think its the toe of the shoe that is shaped up. Not sure if I will order a 10.5. Shoes was really light. They hardly weigh anything. The box weighs more.
New_Balance,3,"I am a new balance fan... purchased these in hopes of comfort and style. Style is there, just not so much the comfort. They make my ankles hurt because the sides don’t have too much support and they are a little flimsy. I wouldn’t recommend for strength training/running. If you’re just going to wear them for a few hours or have a mostly sedentary lifestyle, these would be good. Lightweight and breathable, just not for me."
New_Balance,3,I am always looking for a shoe that is stylish yet comfortable for work. I purchased these shoes for work and had to return them because they are super tight around the top of my toes. They are not good shoes for high insteps.
New_Balance,3,I am frustrated lately about choosing my size in a product then receiving a product that is too small.  I am not going to return this due to inconvenience but they are snug in the toes.
New_Balance,3,"I am in between a size 11 and 12 woman's shoe.  Ordered these in a 12, but they were too small.  Very cute shoe, but order a size up!"
New_Balance,3,I am normally an 8.5 but I always order a 9 in running shoes for extra comfort and room. These UA shoes are very very small. Size 9 should have been plenty big but I can’t wait to get them off after a run/walk. I can’t imagine having to order a 9.5. I’ll keep them hoping they will loosen up over time.
New_Balance,3,"I am on my feet a lot as a preschool teacher and mom to a toddler. I wear these shoes to go walking, go to the park, go to the dog park, and wear to school, and around the house. These shoes are so light and comfortable and fantastic. I can wear a wide fit or standard width and these are just perfect."
New_Balance,3,"I am usually a size 6.5-7.  I ordered a size 7 and found that it was too small and my toes were scrunched.  For the little time I had one of them on, it was comfortable and the shoe was lightweight.  I just exchanged for a size 8 so I am hoping that those will fit!  Really fast turnaround as well regarding the exchange.  I started the exchange process on a Thursday and by Friday they had already shipped my new pair!"
New_Balance,3,I am usually size 7 but ordered size 7.5 and it is too small.
New_Balance,3,"I bought 7.5w for my size 7w size foot.  Too short, exchanged for 8w.  Fits well but sole is too thin, no cushioning.  Returned them.  Still searching for a good workout shoe for my wide feet."
New_Balance,3,I bought 8s which is my normal size but they were made small I guess so I had to replace with an 8 1/2. The shoes are light and nice just wish they were a darker black and didn’t feel right around the toe area.
New_Balance,3,"I bought a half a size larger than I normally would and a WIDE which I don't normally wear. The shoe still was too small in the toe box but because I thought purchasing a WIDE would help, it was way too loose in the heel area. I should have ordered a whole size up and not a wide, but I will stick with my Adidas for now.  I ended up having to return these."
New_Balance,3,"I bought a pair for work since I'd be on my feet a lot. I usually wear size 8.5, so that's what I ordered. I got them and tried them on the same day. I noticed it was tight, but I figured they needed to be broken in. I wore it to work the next day and by the end of the day the top of my feet were sore and aching. I'd loosen the laces throughout the day, but they would tighten back up making my feet hurt. I ended up returning them as soon as I got home. I'd size up either half a size or a whole size. Aside from it being too small, it did feel comfortable. The soles of my feet didn't hurt because of the extra cushion and memory foam that they have in it. I would recommend the shoes, just a bigger size."
New_Balance,3,I bought my normal size in New Balance but these were very small
New_Balance,3,"I bought these  (ladies 11 W)for a gift for my wife whose is rather hard to fit for shoes.  I did not notice the ""slip-on"" reference but probably would have gotten them anyway.  The ""slip-on"" feature prevented her from getting her foot into the shoe.  We have never seen a slip-on with strings.  I had a bit of trouble myself at size 9 W.  Well I decided to keep them for knock-arounds the house since they are quite comfortable.  I will use them as a type of orthopedic house slipper and never buy another pairs of NB's"
New_Balance,3,"I bought these as more stylish alternative to Sketchers Go Walk shoes. I have owned several pairs of Sketchers Go Walk in the past and they have always lasted at least a couple years for me with regular walking. These NB just didn't hold up, though. The foam sole and insole make these a super light and comfy shoe at first, but after just six months the insole and sole were completely depressed and flat and there is little to no support left.  You can clearly see on the side of the sole where there are permanent, deep creases from the foam compressing (will try to update with photos later). I ended up purchasing new inserts to extend the life of these, but even that was difficult because of the shape and fabric of the shoe. Most inserts that provided the appropriate support were too wide for the shoe (and let me emphasize that I do not normally have any special condition or needs when it comes to my feet). I have to say I will probably switch back to Sketchers, which IMHO provided much greater support and lasted much longer."
New_Balance,3,"I bought these because most athletic shoes really bother my bunion, and I thought these would be perfect since the fabric allows the shoe to conform to my foot. After using them a couple times, I noticed that my feet would start sliding inwards while walking, so it would feel as if I was slipping off the shoes completely. To add to that, I showed these shoes to my podiatrist, and she immediately said that as an overpronator, I should not wear shoes like this because it will offer my feet no support. No thanks. Returned these quickly after that."
New_Balance,3,"I bought these for wearing indoors for support because they slip on. They don't have much support.
They are comfortable and well fitting, but a bit thin in the sole."
New_Balance,3,"I bought these shoes as cross trainers but don’t think they are, although when I searched for cross trainers they came up.  The fit runs smaller than the previous New Balance I bought.  They are ok but not what I expected.  Can they still be returned if they have been worn?"
New_Balance,3,I bought these shoes as something I could easily slip on at home. They definitely fit snug - so SIZE UP. I’m normally a 9.5 and my toes were shoved to the front of the shoe. And I felt fairly unstable/pronated in them. I’m going to Try exchanging for a bigger size and see how I feel about them.
New_Balance,3,"I bought these shoes based on the reviews, but when I tried them on they had very little arch support. They were not comfortable for me, had to return them."
New_Balance,3,I bought these shoes to accommodate my ankle brace but didn't realize that you cant really tighten the laces up. The fit was good but didn't give me much support at all.
New_Balance,3,"I bought these shoes to match a Minnie Mouse race costume I had for an up-coming race. They arrived quickly (though the pricing dropped 35% 48 hours after I made my purchase - not cool). They look adorable, and I had high hopes for them. I have a neutral foot, so I can run in pretty much any shoe. I decided to give these a trial run before my race, and I noticed the longer I ran, the more my foot would tilt inwards....like I was trying to run on the very edge of my foot. I got about 10 miles before I had to stop. These are not running shoes. That said, I would likely wear these for casual use, or walking around a theme park, but I do plan on putting some kind of arch support insole in them to ensure they don't do that inward-tilt when wearing them."
New_Balance,3,I bought these sneakers without reading much about their characteristics and people's review. I was looking for a replacement for my New Balance 711. I made a mistake buying these new shoes because they are not intended for training and when I am on my treadmill my leg hurts and there is no cushioning at all.  I might keep them for short-distance walking.
New_Balance,3,"I bought these the end of November and now just 3 month later they have a hole in the toe, like the material is just coming undone... sad. This is the second pair I have owned, sad that this happened in such a short time!"
New_Balance,3,"I bought these to replace another mesh-style New Balance style. I thought they fit well and liked the light weight. Hated the shoelaces; they are flat and come undone constantly, even when double-tied.

However, within a week, the seam where the toe section meets the rest of the upper came undone. It looks as if other seams are loosening. So much for that!"
New_Balance,3,I bought these to walk in Washington DC.  They were fine the first day but then lost their shape. They became too wide no matter how tightly they were tied.  Overall poor quality.
New_Balance,3,I bought these to wear to work which requires me to stand and walk throughout the day. I work in a building with hard tile floors so unfortunately these shoes are a no-go for me because they squeak loudly with every step. If you don’t mind squeaking and just care about comfort then these would be great shoes.
New_Balance,3,I bought this for a gift and they were too tight. The toes are tight so I think these run about 1/2 size smaller than other NB shoes.
New_Balance,3,"I bought this shoe because it came in a wide width. I usually am a true 8 M, but after recently having a Bunionectomy, I needed a wide to compensate for some swelling. The shoe was very snug fitting, was not wide at all on my non surgical foot. I would say the shoe is not true to size. A very cute shoe."
New_Balance,3,"I bought this shoe with the intention of daily walking, but it is a little too narrow for comfort.  I now use this shoe at the gym on a non cardio day."
New_Balance,3,"I buy New Balance brand for the width, but I found these to be very narrow. I didn't find I had good footing in them, and returned them."
New_Balance,3,"I did not like, didn’t feel like enough support"
New_Balance,3,"I do like these sneakers -- they fit extremely well (a bit loose in the toes, which is what I need) and they are very nice looking.  But they're quite a bit less substantial than I had expected, especially at the ~$50.00 price point.  My concern is that they won't last very long.  That aside, they're very nice sneakers."
New_Balance,3,I do not care for these shoes from a comfort perspective.  They are cute but I'd prefer cute and comfortable!!
New_Balance,3,I do not like the toe of this shoe. It is very wide and when you try to tighten with the laces the fabric bunches up!
New_Balance,3,I don’t have a wide foot but always get wide for little extra room and these are still pretty snug for wide size. Had to buy thin socks to have enough room in shoe. My feet do not ache anymore though and that’s a plus!
New_Balance,3,I don’t like the shoe laces but overall light and comfy
New_Balance,3,"I don't know about every color, but I ordered the solid black pair and they definitely run small.  I had to order a full size up.  I am normally a 6.  I even tried a 6 1/2 and they didn't fell any different to me that than the 6 did.  I went with a 7 and now they almost feel too big.  I don' t normally have this problem with NB.  Maybe these are all irregular?"
New_Balance,3,"I don't see them as running shoes; they have no cushioning needed for running. After wearing these a few days, I found the shoes were very wide and i was having trouble keeping them on. I ordered regular width (B). There is no way these are B width; D maybe. My foot kept sliding off the the side. The way the sneaker is made; there is no way to tighten the shoe to fit.
Beautiful shoe. Not for a non wide foot."
New_Balance,3,"I expected a lot more from these as New Balance are one of the most comfortable brands I wear.
I don't feel any ""cushion"" with these shoes. They're on the cheaper side and it definitely feels that way. They're cute, but no more than a sporty accessory."
New_Balance,3,"I expected these to be fine as I sized up to 9. I wear 8.5 in all of my Asics and my NB Foam Arishis. I thought, the 9s might be okay, but they absolutely did not fit with my  custom orthotics. My podiatrist said to get NBs, Asics or on other brand that I can't remember.  Since it is easy to return with Amazon, I will try 9.5, but maybe need wide? Yikes, but I will try since the price us good and they are cute."
New_Balance,3,"I felt as if someone had worn them before! Walking in them was difficult, as if they were trying to correct my gait.

The toe box is short, and not supportive enough for serious walking. I have plantar fasciitis and the arch support is lacking. Not the New Balance I normally love."
New_Balance,3,I found this sneaker to be a tad short on the toes.  My toes actually have a very very small amount of room till my toes touch and the width could be a little better.  They don't quite pinch but could be more comfortable.  New Balance is all I wear and this is the first pair of New Balance sneakers I've ever bought that I'm not thrilled with.
New_Balance,3,"I get many compliments on these shoes, and they match well (the gray/black)! They felt super-comfy at  first but after a short while of walking they become not too comfortable. Tried wearing on concrete floors to work and walk all day...not a chance for me. Small amount of arch support, but they do even slide on well and the soles are VERY flexible, so that part makes them comfortable for me.
Sizing - my usual size 6 was a little tight for me, but 6.5 runs a little loose but not sloppy. I've continued to wear them.
If the insole was improved, I would definitely purchase again, but not at this time."
New_Balance,3,"I got a great deal, but unfortunately I need to return. These were a size too small. A few years back I ordered other New Balance cross trainers, and those ran small, too."
New_Balance,3,I got these sneaker to wear @ my first retail job & they aren't sturdy at all.
New_Balance,3,I had to return it because it was tights around the toe area!
New_Balance,3,"I had to return these due to the size. I ordered my normal size and my toes were pushed up tight to the front edge. Also there little support for arch. Fun little shoes but not supportive and sizing is off.
They are pretty lightweight, and the price on Amazon was good. Just too many issues."
New_Balance,3,"I had to send these back because they were too small. I have the same shoe in another color, which fit perfectly, so I ordered the same size.  These were at least 1-1.5 sizes too small!  I think someone must have labeled these wrong.  Would love to order another pair but now I don’t want the bother in case it happens again.  It’s too bad because the other pair I have are super comfortable."
New_Balance,3,"I hate buying shoes online because of the mixed reviews, even if the product has between a 4-5 star rating.  I've given this shoe a 3-star rating for the following reasons.  The PRO's: I really like the blue color and the color was pretty true to what was shown online.  This shoes is is very light weight and the fabric kinda gives you the impression of a sock shoe.  They also don't show dirt easily either.  They are also easy to get on and off.  They're comfortable to wear until...The CON's: I don't know about the ""Memory Sole"" but, I can't stand or walk around in them now for more than 10-15 min before my arches start to hurt and I'm hobbling.  So I'm going to have to buy inserts for these.  BUT THEN... why buy inserts for these when one of the shoes is already starting to aggravate a bunion I have. I bought a wide width to try and avoid this issue.  I really needed a shoe that was going to be wide enough to not aggravate a bunion while providing arch support.  These shoes do neither.  If you are looking for a pair of shoes to run to the store in and back or around the house, these should work fine.  But if you plan on standing on your feet for a while and or need arch support, these are not it."
New_Balance,3,"I have a wide foot but couldn't this shoe on.  It looked wonderful, too.  It was disappointment because it looked so great.  I returned it and Amazon was very quick as always with the refund. I hlyave other New Balance shoes in that very size that fit .
Thanks, Amazon,"
New_Balance,3,"I have another pair of these in the magnet/rose gold. I like the cushion, fit, and ease these shoes are to put on. I’m usually a size 8 but I bought 7.5 because I knew I wasn’t going to wear any socks with these/treat them more like a slip on. Anyway, I don’t see many reviews mentioning that the Black/Magnet pair is actually a navy color. Buyer beware!! I wanted a black pair (like the picture shows) not a navy pair.

You can see in the picture I’ve included that the tongue is black, the foot is navy."
New_Balance,3,"I have been wearing these about every 2-3 days for 6 months and they are falling apart. The support felt okay when I first got them, now they feel slightly worse than being bare foot except that they keep my feet dry."
New_Balance,3,I have flat feet and after walking a mile my feet were screaming. Very uncomfortable. Changed the insoles and much better. Super cute though.
New_Balance,3,I have had the shoes for a week now and in the right shoe the inside sole is already seperating which can be bothersome when wearing. I would get another pair of shoes thouslgh dont have the money to do so.
New_Balance,3,"I have slightly narrow feet in the instep/arch area of my foot.  I usually wear a 9 and I purchased a 9 but they are too short.  The shoes are also too wide in the instep.  Also, the lacing does not come up high enough to hold my foot snuggly in the shoe.  I am able to slide the shoes on and off without undoing the laces.  I think that this feature was actually built into the shoe, as the shoe has an elastic strap at the instep so that you don’t have to tightly tie the laces.  But because my feet are slightly narrow, the shoes are not snug enough to actually hold my feet in place.  If these shoes did fit my foot, I would consider them to be just a knock around shoe, as they have little to no support."
New_Balance,3,"I have these shoes in a different color, and I love them. However, this pair was very tight and the fabric was stiff. Had to return."
New_Balance,3,"I have to say that this look very nice, however no support at all. If you are looking for something to walk and be on your feet all day, this is not for you. Item returned."
New_Balance,3,"I have wide feet with no arch and am definitely plus sized.... Thses shoes are not for plus size people with flat wide feet , no arch and a motive that includes physical labor and being on your feet for a long time ....  Like 10 hours...."
New_Balance,3,"I have worn New Balance shoes for years. I normally wear a 7 and bought a 7. I could not get my foot in them. I don't think a half size would do it. I think I'd have to go up at least a whole size, maybe more. These are REALLY lightweight. I like the trendy look. The metallic elastic on the side is fun."
New_Balance,3,"I injured my foot, broke near the metatarsal and in-doing so I now need a shoe that has support for my feet. New Balance has a great product. This design is super cute as well!!!"
New_Balance,3,"I just bought these shoes and they just arrived in the mail today. As I was putting trying them on, the fabric tab on the heel ripped off immediately. I am returning them, though am buying another pair as they do seem like they are pretty good shoes other than that. I'm hoping the second pair I get won't have the same issue. In response to other reviews, there also definitely isn't any support and would require inserts if you need the arch support like I do.

Edit: I returned the first pair and replaced them as I did like them. After a few months of wearing them (light wear, haven't used them a lot) the tab on the heel is tearing off again. It's not a huge deal but found that the tab is helpful as they can be somewhat tough to get on (especially with inserts which I require since these shoes provide no support at all). I'll keep them because it's too late to return, but I'm sure there are better sneakers out there that are more durable and have more support."
New_Balance,3,I just felt like my heel and ankle were supported enough.
New_Balance,3,"I JUST USE THESE IN THE GYM.  I DON'T WEAR THEM OUTSIDE.  THEY FEEL OK ON THE TREADMILL ... WALKING, JOGGING AND RUNNING."
New_Balance,3,"I know this shoe has a lot of good ratings. I have a wide foot, and it is wide. It seems smaller than an 8 - I saw belatedly that someone said size up a half size so maybe you need to.  I guess I thought it would be kind of like an old pair of NB I had - maybe a precursor to the minmus line but with more cushioning or something.
Anyway, it's ok but I don't love it."
New_Balance,3,I like the color and the support but I need to exhange my unworn / brand new shoes that I tried on once to check the size. My return label isn't showing up my account? Someone help but def buy if you like the color!
New_Balance,3,"I like the look and feel of these shoes but definitely do not feel they are appropriate for extended wear.  The sole is thin and you can feel every rock you happen to walk on when outside.  I would never wear these shoes for extended wear like for Disneyland or while traveling.  Barely any arch support and lacks the firm support needed for day long walking.

I had hoped to take these to Europe due to them being so light weight.  After wearing them for a day around town though I know they won’t give me the support I need for extended sight seeing.

THINGS I LIKE:
1: light weight, no socks needed!
2: roomy toe box, no pinching
3: easy on and off

WHAT I DO NOT LIKE
1: no arch support
2: no overall support (if you are prone to twisting your ankle this shoe will do nothing to protect you)
3: shoe runs small, order half a size up
4: thin sole that almost has a slipper feel

EDIT: after wearing them a little longer I noticed they give me lower back pain when wearing them for walking around town for 1-2 hours.  The lack of structural/arch support made me decide to downgrade my rating to 2-3 stars."

New_Balance,3,I like the look and the material is okay. I’m sad to say the give me blisters on the back of my ankles so far. They run small I had to exchange for the size above what I normally wear.
New_Balance,3,I like the shoes love the look.  They run a little small I normally where a size 5 but had to buy a 5.5. Only thing I can find wrong is the memory foam sole isn’t that cushioned.
New_Balance,3,I like the sneakers I like the color but when I wear them one on right side  is tighter than the other and I find them a little too narrow
New_Balance,3,I like the way theses shoes look and I can wear them for home days.  I’m on my feet at work as a hairstylist.  These are not comfortable enough for working on your feet all day.
New_Balance,3,I like the way they look but there is absolutely no support & they were a little big!
New_Balance,3,"I like white color. However the quality was not what l expected, too light weight & flimsy . I will keep them as l have had difficulty finding mesh walking shoes."
New_Balance,3,"I liked the appearance of the shoes, but I had to return them. In my opinion they were sized  incorrectly."
New_Balance,3,"I liked the look and comfort this product offered.  I did not like how quickly they felt like very old shoes.  The liner on the bottom cake unflued and was a pain in the neck to reposition each time you wore them, and they stretched out some."
New_Balance,3,I liked the look and the comfort of the shoe but the sizes are way smaller than expected. I normally wear an 8-8 1/2 ordered the 8 1/2 wide and the shoe was way to small. Besides the sizing issue very cute and comfortable shoe.
New_Balance,3,"I live the way the shoe looks but if you need support, this shoe is not for you."
New_Balance,3,"I love NB shoes!  But.... I bought an 8.5 Wide and it was way too tight so I exchanged for a 9 Wide.  I've never had a wider shoe!  It's so wide my feet slide around and the small amount of laces can only cinch so tight and now I'm unable to exchange them.  Unless you have a REALLY wide foot, you might want to order the regular size instead."
New_Balance,3,"I love New Balance and have worn the brand for years. These shoes fit weird. It feels like the shoe is too short around the opening. It’s hard to explain but there’s not enough material around the opening and up. Picture below your ankle when the shoe is on. It should be higher. Because of this they don’t feel sturdy. It feels like they are going to fall off. Also, they are slick on the bottom. So running when the ground is wet could cause you to slip and fall."
New_Balance,3,I love that these come in wide. While the bottom is very soft they offer little to no support and I wouldn’t recommend them for long walking. My toes ended up going numb after a few hours of wearing them. Additionally you need a very high sock as the back is higher than in originally new balance sneakers  in the back or they will really bother you.
New_Balance,3,I love the design and the light weight product! Have had about a month and feel like they are already falling apart. After average wear but they are extremely comfortable.
New_Balance,3,"I love the look of the shoe but it really hurt my feet. I wore them around the house for a couple of days thinking I could deal with the pain in my foot because the shoes are so cute, but they were just way to uncomfortable for my feet. I’m sad they didn’t work out for me."
New_Balance,3,"I love the look of these and they are comfortable and the Tread grips well on concrete floors. However, I wish there were more lace holes to tighten them better. Doing any type of HIIT or high intensity workout feels like they nights slip off my feet.
I feel like the last two pairs of New Balance shoes have been lower quality than the New Balance styles of the past. I’ve been wearing New Balance for over 10 years and am rarely disappointed. This style is not my favorite and just feels cheaply made."
New_Balance,3,I love these shoes but they’re far too tight. Order these 1/2 to 1 full size up. They’re lightweight and shouldn’t be used for exercise. They’re for everyday wear. Will be ordering up!
New_Balance,3,I love these shoes. I wouldn’t wear them to exercise in but for everyday wear they are great!
New_Balance,3,"I love these shoes. The ankle is really low for those of us with thicker legs, so it is slimming. The memory foam in the foot bed is so comfortable and forms to your foot. I have high arches and my arches do not hurt in this shoe. I got the navy and gold and I love the pop of gold. I wear when running errands. Not sure how supportive it would be during a workout."
New_Balance,3,"I love these shoes. They are really comfortable. However, after 3 days of wearing half of the rubber under the shoe came off. I had to super glue it back on. Now another part is coming off."
New_Balance,3,"I love this shoe, unfortunately it doesn’t love me back. I purchased them to jump rope for exercise. I use a stall mat similar to gym flooring. The shoes felt absolutely great when I first started. Really light shoe with very comfortable cushions inside, but I quickly learned the soles are very slippery!  I usually work up a pretty good sweat while training. My second day wearing the shoes, I stepped in the sweat and almost killed myself. Now I’m afraid to wear them for jumping."
New_Balance,3,I love this shoe. I had the black and want it in more colors. I have a hard time finding shoes that fit my unique feet so I was super excited to find these. However the 8 wide was not wide.
New_Balance,3,"I loved the fit and style of the show. Very comfortable. I have to wear black shoes for work and these were perfect. I did notice a disappointment today though, only a month after wearing. On the left shoe the stitching is coming apart where the toe stitching and left arch stitching come together. I only use these shoes for work, which is a desk job. I am not sure why the stitching is coming apart when the most I do in these is walk."
New_Balance,3,I loved the shoe but it was too small. I always wear size 8 but this 8 was too small so I had to send them back.:(
New_Balance,3,I loved them but I needed a 7.5 wide and they didnt have this color in that size when I ordered.
New_Balance,3,"I need to wear these more but my initial take is a bit skeptical, mostly regarding how they were ‘packaged’. It’s as if someone threw new shoes into in an old box, I guess they could’ve lightly worn but even the tag was cut off and left in the old box. I double checked the seller and it looks to be New Balance, not professional at all. Typically I’m a Nike girl but I thought these were rated well and all I really needs was a new pair of sturdy walking shoes. Already they fit a little snug but ok, they also looked flimsy in the box, they slip on easy and are very cute but I’m not sure how long these will last. I may post an update but I guess buyer beware, these may be a less than legit purchase."
New_Balance,3,"I needed some cross-trainers for CrossFit. I love the look of these and how low profile they are, but honestly, they offer little to no support. But they are comfortable due to the memory foam insole."
New_Balance,3,I normally wear a 71/2 so I ordered an eight. Should have ordered an 81/2. But they are so cute I wore them . Mistake. Order one size up
New_Balance,3,"I normally wear a size 9 except for running shoes, where I go up 1/2 size.  I bought these to walk the dogs, and went up 1/2 size based on reviews.  When I received the size 9.5, I could tell the moment I put them on they were too small.  You could actually see the outline of my big toe on the top of the shoe with every step I took.  May try a size 10, which I have never needed before!  Very comfy, but way too small!"
New_Balance,3,"I normally wear Vionic sneakers and they are super comfy and support my feet how I need them to.  That being written I took a chance based on all the good reviews.  The shoes aren't bad, however I would NOT wear them for long walks or if I planned to spend hours on my feet outside my house.
I found the memory foam insert gets uncomfortable after an hour or so on my feet.  It's not 100% uncomfortable when I""m at home and can take the shoes off, but outside the house I would be unhappy.  I also noticed when I first put them on, the toe box was a tad bit tight, I decided to keep wearing them and see if they loosened and they did.
To ME, they aren't the best shoe for MY feet with plantar fasciitis so I would net order these again.  I don't mind wearing them in the house to do things or yard work outside, but like I wrote before, I would not order these again."
New_Balance,3,I only wear these for working out. The insert came lose after just a few wears and scrunches up under your toes. I am able to press the insert back into place but it is uncomfortable. Every time I wear these shoes I have to adjust the inserts more than once. I would ask for my money back if I was able.
New_Balance,3,I ordered 8.5 wide because the reviews said to order a size up. I am normally 7-8 regular. The 8.5 wide was still too tight I could barely fit my foot in. I also don’t like that the backs are paper thin.
New_Balance,3,"I ordered a 9.5 but sometimes I get a 10 in tennis shoes, because I hate them being snug. These felt a bit snug when they arrived and I wish I had gotten one more half size up. I loved the light color of these and may consider ordering them again, I just felt they were a big thin and the dip in the angle could get annoying with socks always showing. So I haven't decided yet if I will order them again after returning the 9.5's. I think I may research some more New Balance styles, since I do enjoy the comfort of this brand."
New_Balance,3,I ordered a half size larger because I like the shoes that I use for walking on my treadmill to have more room. The shoes were so tight I ended up giving them to my daughter who wears a smaller shoe size .
New_Balance,3,I ordered a half size up and still too small.
New_Balance,3,"I ordered Black/Magnet ( black upper/ black sole). They were just what I wanted until I wore them outside. In the sun, they are dark blue, obliviously dark blue. So disappointed."
New_Balance,3,"I ordered my normal size and they were too small. I returned them. However,  they  are very light and otherwise comfortable. I have a high instep so it was a bit of a struggle to get my foot in the shoe. Although there are laces, the shoe doesn’t fully open as you might expect. I am considering reordering a half size up."
New_Balance,3,I ordered the right size so my toes have breathing room but the shoe dips down so low and is loose in the back. It feels like the shoes don't have enough support and like they were going to fly off of my foot with any activity. I am disappointed because they are BEAUTIFUL shoes!! I hope they work better for others!
New_Balance,3,I ordered the same size in a different color and they were perfect. This pair feels like a 7. I only have this problem with New Balance. It's hit or miss on whether they'll feel like the right size or not.
New_Balance,3,"I ordered these shoes in my normal size which is 7 wide and wish I ordered a 7 1/2 wide instead. I work long 12 hour shifts and I’m constantly on my feet and barely have time to sit, my toes are too cramped inside. I got these shoes, hoping they would be my go-to shoes for work, but after wearing them for a few days, I cannot bear the pain anymore. I really wanted to like these shoes based on the reviews but will have to find another pair of shoes to wear.

P.S. - The price significantly dropped a couple days after I purchased them, which is also a bummer!"
New_Balance,3,"I ordered this shoe in the black/white sole and in the grey.  Both the same size.  The Grey fits great, but the black/white sole is shorter.  Holding them up to each other the Black is a half inch shorter.  My toes are cramped.  The Arch fits great, but no room for my toes.  If I could find the box and or the label, I would return them for a larger size.  This is the first item I have ever wanted to return.  There was a comment at the beginning with the same issue and recommended ordering a size-up.  Perhaps these are not marked correctly for size."
New_Balance,3,I ordered two pair of these because my normal size (5.5) was a little snug. My second pair is a size 6 wide. I wound up keeping both pair because I couldn't decide which pair fit  the best. What I didn't appreciate is my first pair was $ 60 something and when I ordered another pair a couple of days later they were $74! Not nice!  Wore them in Disney and they are so comfortable!!
New_Balance,3,"I purchase these and had to return, Too Small."
New_Balance,3,"I purchased a wide width and these are still incredibly tight. If you have flat feet, the arches will hurt within a couple hours of wearing. I love that they slip on and are super lightweight but I can't get the kind of all day wear with these that I was able to in the past with other models of New Balance."
New_Balance,3,I read a review that said true to size. I wish I had a half size larger.
New_Balance,3,"I read all the bad reviews about these shoes running small. I ordered mine 1/2inch larger and when I tried them on..still too small. I’m a 6/12 in Reebok & Nike brands and they fit perfect. However I ordered a size 7 and my toes were at the very top. The memory soles also slipped out a few times of wearing. They are really cute shoes, not good quality."
New_Balance,3,I really like the looks of these sneakers. They are light weight yet soles are good.
New_Balance,3,"I really like the way these look, they are extremely lightweight and comfortable around the foot. There are a few dislikes, first the memory foam insole is so thin and offers no support, when I exercise in them it actually hurts my arch and second the sole of the shoe is very very thin and slippery when wet- I almost fell on a tile floor and on the train to work, it almost feels like they are greased or something. I ordered a supportive insert for them hopefully that helps, can’t do much about the bottoms but I’ll try not to wear them in the rain...overall i really love how they look with leggings though so I’ll definitely keep wearing them"
New_Balance,3,"I really like them but I ordered one size 8.5 which I always wear and had to exchange for a larger size, 9, then the larger size was still too small... so, order maybe a size larger"
New_Balance,3,I really like these shoes.... but I have been wearing them for less than two weeks and I can already see the break down in the heel of the shoe!!! Have a feeling I will have to replace them within 4 months
New_Balance,3,"I really like these sneakers unfortunately they are to small, I guess I should have ordered a wide. I would like to exchange for the correct size, it seems the only option is to return then reorder them but they are currently a different price? I don't understand this!"
New_Balance,3,"I really love the look at these shoes, however the support was just not there! I really tried to keep them I tried putting some inserts in and it just they were not comfortable. This is my second pair of so I was excited to receive them however for some reason this pair was not the same as the first."
New_Balance,3,"I really needed this for work to keep my feet cool and support. It is a light shoe but not great for all day walking over concrete.
I still like it but i feel soar in my hip joints at the end of my day. This shoe would be great for running errands but not all day."
New_Balance,3,I returned the shoe. I could not get my foot in it so I don’t know if the width was right or not I think I will re-order this shoe in a size larger
New_Balance,3,I returned the shoes because they were too small.  I can often wear a D width in New Balance but these were too narrow.  They also seemed a little short for a size 6.  I might have tried sizing up to a 6.5 W but I was disappointed in the overall quality of the shoe.  Not what I expect from New Balance.
New_Balance,3,I returned them because I needed more support. A younger person will like that they feel like socks with a thin padded bottom.... like bedroom slippers.  I need a more substantial shoe.
New_Balance,3,I returned these shoes even though the reviews were amazing and I got a great deal. Pro - the sole cushion is amazing. Con - no ankle support. I need more support for my ankles so these just weren’t going to work for me.
New_Balance,3,I think this would’ve been great footwear for other people. But I have a high needs feet so there was not enough support
New_Balance,3,"I thought these new balance shoes would be just as comfy as my others. They're not. They don't support my door or arch like my other pairs..they are not the Fulecore. I like that I can pull them on quickly, but having a more narrow foot, I need to be able to tighten them more with the laces than I am able to. My feet hurt after wearing them all day...that sucks."
New_Balance,3,"I thought these shoes were comfortable and cool looking and so I ordered them not thinking. Obviously these shoes have no ankle support, which is something I have to have. Other than this important factor they were comfortable. Unfortunately I had to return them."
New_Balance,3,"I use this shoe to work out in 3 days a week and i love them!  In fact, this is the second pair i’ve bought.  I’ve never had any issues with these shoes - they’re so comfortable and lightweight!  With other brands i’ve had problems with the heel fitting properly because my heel is so narrow - but not with these."
New_Balance,3,"I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 shoe in wide width. I purchased an 8 wide. They are really cute but they are too small. I suppose I would need an 8.5 wide of which I have never worn.

I couldn't wait for them to arrive. They arrived, and I quickly unboxed and tried on. My toes came to the very end. So disappointed. I also noticed there is really not much arch support or cushion for comfort. I had hoped to take on my next trip but they are not airport walking ready.

I will be returning these soon."
New_Balance,3,"I usually wear an 8.5 in New Balance but this sneaker is way too small.  I will order a 9.  I feel disappointed because I was looking forward to wearing this sneaker right away.  Also, the sneakers arrived just in a delivery box and not in a shoe box which makes me wonder how many times these shoes were tried on and returned."
New_Balance,3,"I walk a lot and need shoes with cushion.  These, while really cute and fit Very Well, have a very thin sole; thus, I am unable to walk for any length of time in them.  New Balance and Sketchers are the 2 brands that fit my feet the best so I stick with these brands; but, I am finding the cushioning is lessening as time goes by."
New_Balance,3,"I want to send these back, they are too small. I wear a size 6 and I ordered a size 6.5 to be sure and they were still too small. They are not good for walking and they rub the back of you heel. They are nice looking so please order a full size up."
New_Balance,3,I wanted to love these but the fit is off for me. I’m normally 7.5/8 and I got an 8 in these but definitely need an 8.5 for length. The laces/ankle opening is really wide and looks funny tightened up to accommodate my foot. I do have narrow/petite feet and ankles but don’t usually have trouble with this.
New_Balance,3,I wanted to love these shoes but they seem to be made very cheaply. They are also very small. I have a pretty narrow foot but they are tight and uncomfortable.
New_Balance,3,"I wanted to substitute my Adidas Cloudfoam shoes with similar ones (I loved those but they only lasted a year). These are similar in terms of lightness and soft, comfy internal sole. These look stronger on the exterior sole than the Adidas. But the toe box fits too tight in the New Balance shoes. I had to return the first pair and buy the next number (from 7.5 to 8) and now, the shoes fit me well but are still tight at the toes. They look very nice."
New_Balance,3,I was expecting a better quality from NB. I’ve had their shoes in the past and these just seem to be made with lower grade materials.
New_Balance,3,"I was looking for a shoe with lots of support for work, but the sole is a lot thinner than I expected. If I were to rebuy I’d go half a size up and not wear them for jobs that are all standing and walking."
New_Balance,3,"I was looking forward to getting these after reading such wonderful reviews, but I found they ran a solid FULL size too small, so I will need to return. I held up one of these sneakers to my nike sneakers in the same size, and they are definately smaller.  I have a narrow foot, and rarely have to size up. Width-wise, the shoe was very roomy, it was just short in length. That being said, the footbed was extremely comfortable and the fit was wide, so good for wider feet. I ended up ordering a womens 12, and they fit much better, but honestly still a bit snug. I am going to keep them to wear with thin socks as a casual shoe, but likely won't be a work out shoe (thicker socks would take up too ,uch space)"
New_Balance,3,"I was searching for a good walking shoe. This isn't it for me. Very lightweight, but lacking the support I expected. Front dimples, a factor I don't care for. I will keep them, but only wear occasionally. The hunt is back on for a walking sneaker"
New_Balance,3,"I was so disappointed because I thought these shoes were so cute! The tongue part is all one piece with the shoe and when I'd go to tie them, it would fold over because it was too big and rub on the top of my foot. I ended up returning them because it was just too uncomfortable. I also would say if you have weak ankles, these would not be good shoes for you-not very stable support around the ankle. I think these shoes might be great for casual purposes, but not as good for exercise."
New_Balance,3,"I was so excited because the fit was perfect. After my first workout the inside lining sole was torn out and bunched up. :( I keep trying to ""fix"" them and they will stick for a little while. I wish they worked out for me better."
New_Balance,3,I wasn’t satisfied. Looks good. Sounds good but not.
New_Balance,3,"I wear a 10 but I needed to exchange this for a 10 wide. Not to say that as I get older my feet change too. I should expect that I guess but the shoe is narrow. It is also very lightweight. I bought it for new shoes to wear to the gym and that's as far as they go. They are not rugged wear but for lighter wear. That's fine, just know what you want in a sneaker shoe."
New_Balance,3,I wear a size 71/2 to an 8 depending on the shoe. However I ordered an 8 and it was still a little snug in the toe area. Theres no real arch support so not a good shoe for working out in or Zumba as my feet were hurting so bad within 30 min of dancing. The shoe is ok looks wise...thought it would've been cuter but not bad either.
New_Balance,3,"I wear very consistent size 7 or 7.5 shoes.  I have another pair of new balance that are 7.5 and are roomy.  Ordered 7.5 for these figuring they'd be just right to little roomy and they are a solid FULL size too small.  Looks like its too late to return so they'll be donated.  If they fit, they look nice and are light weight."
New_Balance,3,"I went by what other reviewer's said, and ordered a bigger size than my usual 9 1/2. I ordered a size 10, and was still too small. I would recommend to order a full size up.  Another problem I didn't like was where the laces go through it was crooked on the left shoe while the right shoe was straight."
New_Balance,3,I wish these shoes were true to size. I ordered a 9 and could barely put my feet in them. The shoes were cute and VERY comfortable. I tried to exchange them for a larger size but they didnt have it. Order a full size up if you can.
New_Balance,3,"I work 8 hours a day 5 days a week, walking, moving doing things. After  5 months holes happened in the toe of the show and before they started to hurt my feet.  So would be good for part time wear not every day wear."
New_Balance,3,I work high paced on hard surfaces all day. I do not recommend these for this. The price is too much for too little padding and not enough arch support. I had to order inserts. These are light weight with a nice wide toe box when ordering then with the extra wide and slip resistant. That's about it.
New_Balance,3,"I would say it was true to size but the shoes had no support and was fairly uncomfortable after just one hour of walking. There is not much cushion anywhere in the shoe(especially ball of foot) so you can feel everything you step on outside. Overall the shoes are okay for minor things but if you want a nice supporting walking shoe, this is not the one."
New_Balance,3,"I would size up by a half size, I ordered my normal 8 and they were snug. Otherwise they are okay. I wouldn’t buy again, not as comfortable as I had hoped"
New_Balance,3,I’m always a size 8 in almost everything and these were way too small!
New_Balance,3,"I’m an avid runner, I own multiple NB shoes. I’m usually a 6-6.5 shoe so I go up to a 7 in running shoes. Something was just off with these, the left shoe looked funny and just felt off center. They were very lightweight and fit like a 6.5. I wouldn’t recommend these for actual running but if you want a sporty look, they’d do. Returning for a better product. Very pretty shoe, just wouldn’t recommend for runners."
New_Balance,3,I’m between a size 9-9.5 so I ordered on the upside per other reviews. These shoes are still a little small and I haven’t decided if I’ll keep them or return. Size 10 is only available from outside sellers and the price is double compared to the 9.5s! Otherwise it’s a nice looking; easy on/off sneaker. Disappointing.
New_Balance,3,I’m sad to only write 3 stars as this feels so good on my feet. I work 10 hours a day on my feet and these shoes feel like heaven even after a long day. The memory foam is great and somewhat cooling. My only issue is the sizing is so different from all my other shoes. I am normally a size 7 so that is what I ordered. I had to return and get a size up because the 7 was too tight. Upon reviving the size 8 I had to return again because it was still too snug for my liking since I do work long hours. So it was a bit of a hassle but the comfort is great I just suggest getting a size or two higher than normal.
New_Balance,3,"If I had brought my other shoes to the gym, I never would have cut the tags and worn these. These sneakers aren't meant for any type of real training. I tried running and strength training in them, but they don't have enough support in every way. I have thin ankles and the back of my foot is short, so these do not keep me in the shoe when moving side to side. They have a very thin layer of foam/ cushion that deflates after only 2-3 wears. I almost rolled my ankles doing side to side motions in these. I think they're more for casual wear- like people who want comfortable flats to wear while running errands on the weekend. They run a tad wide/ long and if you have skinny ankles, they will be loose around your ankle because they are constructed like slip-ons. I wouldn't recommend this for runners/ fit girls."
New_Balance,3,If you have no arch do not buy these. The arch area is extremely narrow and curved inward. The shoes are nice overall and look cute with jeans.
New_Balance,3,If you have wide feet- don’t order!!! Otherwise they are cute & very lightweight
New_Balance,3,If you need padding on the bottom of your feet this is not the shoe for you.  These are one step up from barefoot.  They're not for walking any distance.  Kind of like wearing heavy socks around the house.
New_Balance,3,If you wear wide make sure to go up in size. But other then that i love them
New_Balance,3,I'm a nurse that works 12 hour shifts and these are very comfortable for me. The memory foam is a great add on to a stylish shoe. Would recommend. I use these shoes with compression socks which is sorta thin.
New_Balance,3,Im impressed by the feel and lightness of these trainers. And they're comfy on the feet!!
New_Balance,3,I'm usually a size 6.5. When I first bought these in 6.5 they were a little small. Not a comfortable fit. So I returned them and ordered a size up - 7. These still feel a bit cramped. I recommend buying a size and a half up if you want a comfortable fit.
New_Balance,3,"It doesn't support my heel, and after wearing for two weeks I notice a lot of wrinkles on the sole. Not durable."
New_Balance,3,It feels like your foot is turning to the inside when you walk in the shoe. Not enough inside support. Would not buy again.
New_Balance,3,IT FELT GOOD FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE
New_Balance,3,It is comfortable and light BUT not recommended for those who have flat feet like I do.
New_Balance,3,It is not a running/jogging/walking shoe. No support. Good for just going back and forth to a store/doing errands.
New_Balance,3,"It may be one of those instances where it's better to not have any expectations, but the write up about this shoe that I read somewhere on-line made it sound like the most comfortable thing ever, so I was really looking forward to wearing them. They are pretty comfortable, but nothing outstanding and are not that cushy. Plus, the ""lace area"" is short....maybe half that of some sneakers, so you can not adjust the fit width-wise much at all and they are hard to get into because the tongue is not completely separate, so hard to open up wide enough to slip your foot in. The shoe may be fine/great for some people, but I came close to sending back for a refund. One reason why I decided to keep it was the muted color I got and the style and fabric make it look a little nicer/""dressier"" than my other sneakers/athletic shoes."
New_Balance,3,"It was a little tight at the toes, but they were my favorite shoes. Were. I kept noticing my feet were hurting then my right hip kept hurting. My right heel on the sole, had totally worn down. Just on one side. I was going to buy another pair or 2 because they were so comfortable, but the sole wear is an issue for me."
New_Balance,3,It was comfortable width BUT it was shorter in length.  I wear a size 7 normally these shoes feels like a size 6 1/2.  My toes are rubbing against front of shoes.  So I would recommend a 1/2 size bigger.
New_Balance,3,"It was difficult at first because I use an innersole, bus I was able to get it on.  The second time I wore the sneakers it was easier."
New_Balance,3,"It’s a nice fashion sneaker not a running shoe. When I went for a run in it, I was missing the support in my heal and it kept sliding left and right in the shoe."
New_Balance,3,It’s been about a month since I’ve had these new balance and the shoes are just ok. They are a step up from Walmart’s $10 memory foam shoes but I’m not really a fan of these either. They are acceptable because they are cheap but stylish. I wear these in a warehouse environment with concrete floors so I do go through shoes fast.
New_Balance,3,It's a comfortable shoe for a few hours and then it hurts the arch and is not a very supportive shoe.
New_Balance,3,Its design is cute. But the color isn’t black. Its very dark navy and The pad slips off. You get what you pay for.
New_Balance,3,I've had these like only a month and normal wear and tear and the soles are coming off. Very sad!
New_Balance,3,"I've had these shoes for a few months now, and they're very comfortable for casual wear. I like the way they look, they're easy to slip on, and my feet never hurt wearing them. However, I did get into the habit of walking about 6 miles a day recently, and I've worn these shoes for over 300 miles of walking. It's gotten to the point where I've realized they're not meant for this, because my feet will often hurt afterwards, and the insoles don't have the spring they used to. I would not recommend them for extended wear or exercise. But if you're looking for something comfy to just wear around and not run or walk seriously in, these are great."
New_Balance,3,"I've worn New Balance before so didn't hesitate ordering my usual size (half size up for athletic shoes). The shoes are great looking and I was tempted to keep them hoping after wearing they would stretch a bit; but I decided not to take the chance. Shoes have a good arch and the price was terrific. However, the shoe runs narrow in the toe area. I wear a size 8 regular for dress & casual shoes and always get 8 1/2 for athletic shoes so I can wear heavier socks. But even with thinner socks for summer, the toe area was still too tight.  I'll be returning this pair of shoes."
New_Balance,3,Just a little too tight had to return wanted to exchange but would not allow and now the price is  over $10 more and disappointed
New_Balance,3,Like how they look
New_Balance,3,Like the color but disappointed with the support. I will definitely wear them but not for any long walking excursions.
New_Balance,3,Like the way it looks!  Clean lines & sort of streamlined looking...but I think this not a shoe for the power walker...or anyone chalking up mileage on a serious exercise program...is lightweight &  looks to me like it lacks the amenities of other new balance walking shoes...I regularly find that when purchasing  new balance shoes one needs to add 1/2 size...they did this at the store when I bought my 1st pair & it has held true for my 3 newer pairs...I like this shoe...but will wear it casually & not for daily exercise
New_Balance,3,"Likes the look, but the shoe ran too small"
New_Balance,3,Little support and less comfort. It's not what I expected. I was ordering for work but was greatly disappointed.
New_Balance,3,Looked good.  But no arch support.
New_Balance,3,"Los pedí en un color llegaron de otro color,pero igual me lps dejé porqué estaba como segunda opción de color. Son muy cómodos, me encantan,lo único es que la plantilla se empieza a salir con el tiempo y aveces es incómodo.pero del resto bien"
New_Balance,3,"Love love love! Comfy, light, perfect fit!"
New_Balance,3,Love my shoes they fit good and feel great they have a arch and memory foam
New_Balance,3,Love that they’re lightweight but the support really isn’t great and they feel kind of cheap.
New_Balance,3,Love them
New_Balance,3,Love these but run very small! I’m usually an 8.5 but ordered a 9 and they are way too small.
New_Balance,3,Love these shoes... they are so cute and so comfortable.  I’ve ordered a pair for myself as well as my kids. We love them. However they run small. I wear a 9 but ordered a 9.5 and they’re fine. My oldest wears a size 6 and she needed an 8!!! That’s 2 shoe sizes! My middle daughter wears a 5 and she ended up in a 6.5 so again a whole shoe size and a half. My youngest wears a kids 10 and she is good with the 10.5 so honestly these shoe sizes are just a surprise when you get them I guess. Disappointed in the sizing as we had to send shoes back two and three times to get what we needed.
New_Balance,3,Love these! If you are looking for a strength traing shoe I reccomend these. They fit my foot perfectly so that I am not sliding around when I am doing squats or jumping jacks. Will definatly buy again.
New_Balance,3,"Love this shoe it’s so light weight and comfortable BUT my Gott hangs over the arch part of the shoe and that’s terrifying and asking for a rolled ankle! If you are not 110 pounds, this is not for you!"
New_Balance,3,"Loved the look, but the fit was less than I expected.  Fit extremely narrow with no support."
New_Balance,3,"Loved the shoe and pattern. However, it was too narrow. I had the 8 wide and it didn’t fit."
New_Balance,3,Loved the shoe. Was just way to small. I even ordered it a half size bigger than I usually wear!
New_Balance,3,Loved these shoes when I first got them 9 days ago - they are so lightweight and so comfortable!  But after less than two weeks they have ripped near the front seam on the right shoe (see pic). I've only worn them 5 or 6 times. I'll return them for a new pair and will review those. Hopefully this is just a fluke and the new pair will last a lot longer!
New_Balance,3,Loved this product
New_Balance,3,Material was a bit softer than I expected and not a lot of support but I'm ok with it for now
New_Balance,3,"May have gotten better reviews if it fit.  I ordered up a half size and it was just plain uncomfortable.  Not sure if the sizing was that far off, or if it’s just not compatible with my foot."
New_Balance,3,Me gusta cómo queda es cómodo la medida es la exacta
New_Balance,3,More support
New_Balance,3,"Most said buy a size up I did a half size up and it feels snug at my toes maybe it needs breaking in to . The shoe is light and beautiful for casual wear not sure I can do exercise in this . Would be back with a review

Go seize up for that toe box area"
New_Balance,3,"My daughter likes the shoes alot, but the heel strap on one of the shoes broke after 4 days of use."
New_Balance,3,My daughter needed black sneakers for colorguard and these for great and are comfortable during her long practices
New_Balance,3,My favorite shoes!
New_Balance,3,My favorite sneaker.  But came with a security tag on it!!!
New_Balance,3,My only dislike is needs more support inside the shoe
New_Balance,3,"My wife has had these shoes less than 1 month and loves them. They’re very comfortable and fit well. However, after only wearing them a handful of times, for just general wear, there is a hole in the seam."
New_Balance,3,Narrow and somewhat smaller than I expected.
New_Balance,3,Narrow toe box
New_Balance,3,Needed good walking shoe for trip to Europe. Memory foam was nice but shoe offered no support. Had to use arch inserts.
New_Balance,3,"Nice looking shoe, but runs a little small and the soles do not last.  Cute shoes, easy to put on, but not very comfortable or supportive."
New_Balance,3,Nice shoe but little support and runs wide.
New_Balance,3,Nice shoe.
New_Balance,3,Nice sneaker but my ankles roll
New_Balance,3,"Nice sneaker, however, I wanted a slip on, not a sneaker with ties"
New_Balance,3,"Nice style light weight, but fits small."
New_Balance,3,"Nicely designed product, but strange sizing. Too short, too wide at toes. Returned."
New_Balance,3,No cushion in the sole for running.
New_Balance,3,"No real side support. Even wearing casually, they’re just okay. I couldn’t wear them long just walking around because there really just isn’t much support at all. Cute for quick errands or going to dinner, but don’t plan hours of walking around in them."
New_Balance,3,No real support for arches.
New_Balance,3,No support
New_Balance,3,No support or cushion.
New_Balance,3,No support. Like wearing a slipper that laces up.
New_Balance,3,Not as expected. Although very light toe area not comfortable. Bought W750 and am thrilled with this running shoes. Black/Pink fantastic
New_Balance,3,Not as supportive as I would like. Will by inserts for them.
New_Balance,3,"Not exactly true to size. Using the same brand( new balance shoe) I ordered the same size  based off of that and it was too small. Otherwise the shoe would have met all the criteria’s I’m sure
Comfort, price, colour and hopefully quality too but I had to return it so no way of knowing now."
New_Balance,3,"Not much cushioning, feels cheap but looks cute"
New_Balance,3,"Not much support, had to buy inserts."
New_Balance,3,"Not sure why the shoes are super thin.
Would not recommend these as a running shoe but maybe they could be a good weight lifting shoe. Was hoping to get a cheaper shoe besides under armor but I think I’ll spend $50 on a basic black under armour shoe again instead of these."
New_Balance,3,Not whatbi was expecting from new balance but im sure thier other styles are more suitable for me
New_Balance,3,"Ok... Just Ok... there is some kind of protector piece on the inside at the tip of the toe and it bothered my toe nail... Other than that. Meh, I just wasn't impressed, had higher hopes."
New_Balance,3,"Okay so these shoes are mostly great, they are super cute, they fit a tiny bit snug at first but stretched out within a day. The problem is probably only if you get the wides. The shoe itself is definitely wider than average but the sole doesnt seem to be. My foot constantly slides off the sole to the inside of the shoe. I have wide feet and never gotten wide shoes before so idk if this is how wide shoes are supposed to be but I assumed they would have a wider sole. Otherwise I really like these shoes and I still wear them but only for short periods of time."
New_Balance,3,"One of the most uncomfortable sneakers I have ever owned.  They actually feel OK at first, but the longer I wear them the tighter they feel until at last I rip them in desperation  off my feet. Plus, the material inside is slippery and on inclines my feet slide to either side of the shoe.  I'm not sure why these are like this - I have purchased NB many times before. but these have a cheap mesh sponge-like material that you can't really see from the picture. There is also an elastic band on the sides of the sneaker , which is maybe why they feel they are constantly getting tighter."
New_Balance,3,Order a size up
New_Balance,3,Ordered 9W and the heel of the footbed feels too narrow and sometimes slips to the side when my heel strikes the ground.  I have other New Balance trainers in the same size that don't have this problem.
New_Balance,3,Ordered a wide because I’m flat footed and on my feet all day seen the reviews and that and that they had wides I most definitely had to order these. When they came in and I wore them for the first time I was like WOW these are amazingly comfortable but after a week of walking and work I noticed my feet cramping up like they had no room took my shoe off to look the tag but I just had a feeling these were not a wide and they weren’t😔 . The shoes are perfect but if you’re a flat footer like me be careful when ordering.
New_Balance,3,Ordered my normal size fit tight around foot and big at toes
New_Balance,3,Ordered my usual size. This shoe was too small.  I wore them about a week thinking they would stretch out in the toe area but they didn't. So I ordered a half size larger. These felt exactly the same as the original size ordered so I returned the new pair. If I could've returned the first pair I would've. I hate I wasted my money. Cute shoe but the sizing is completely off
New_Balance,3,"Ordered the black with pink/gold stripe, but got an all-black shoe. Don’t trust the picture to advertise what you’re buying. Otherwise though, tried it on and the shoes are perfect for my wide feet for a workout that quickly switches from cardio to weights. Will send back in hopes of getting a color more suitable though."
New_Balance,3,"Ordered these tennis shoes, I usually wear a size 8 in Nike Women's shoes and these fit WAY too small. I was impressed by how light these were and I loved the off-white color.

However, the tennis shoes paired with my regular exercise socks fit much too tight.  I suggest sizing up a half size to full size when comparing to Nike shoes."
New_Balance,3,Perfect fit!
New_Balance,3,please do not wear to work if you need slip resistant shoe's. I almost busted my butt at my job.
New_Balance,3,"Probably going to return these. I should have ordered a half size larger than I usually wear.  I’d have to buy some really thin socks or they aren’t going to fit at all. They have zero arch support and though they are very light, not uncomfortable and I don’t hate them, they aren’t what I expected. I don’t think they offer enough support for more than casual wear. They were in the “slip-on” category so I thought the laces were “fake” stretchy things. Nope. This is just a regular, cheap tennis shoe. The toe box is large, the rest of the shoe is narrow. They’re over priced for the quality. They’re comparable to the slip-on sketchers, which are $25 less."
New_Balance,3,"product was ok for the price, but poor quality"
New_Balance,3,"Pros: The shoe is very soft and light weight.

Cons: The shoe moved a lot during exercise. I walk/run for about an hour 5 times a week and I tested the shoes out for about a week.
It didn't matter what what socks I wore, or how loose or tight I would have the laces, the shoes didn't correctly support my foot, causing ankle and knee pain.
I double checked the measure for the size chart, and it recommended the size I purchased.

The shoe looks good and I really like them, but I will only use them for light activities."
New_Balance,3,"Pros: very cute and comfy could definitely see this more as a fashion sneaker.
Cons: no arch support. I felt my foot rolling in while walking in these  also, the sides dip down more than I expected. So I’m a little confused by the kind of socks yours supposed to wear haha"
New_Balance,3,purchased these and was sent a wide width and they were definitely too large for my foot. it just kept slipping up and down on my foot.
New_Balance,3,Queda muy pequeño
New_Balance,3,"Quick delivery, & I LOVE the color/look of the shoe, but size is off & is not correct. I bought the exact same shoe & size (10) in black from Rack Room a couple years, and these (gray with rose color) are not a 10. More like an 8 or 9. I like the look of them so much & already know they are a super comfortable shoe, so I'm going to order another pair in the next size up & hope they fit. Luckily the 1's I just received will fit my daughter soon so I don't have to mess with returning shoes. At least this pair anyway 🤞"
New_Balance,3,Read the reviews so I ordered a half size up and they still did not fit so I had to send them back and got a 9 still a little snug and it said the shoes were non slip and there not kinda of disappointing.
New_Balance,3,Really cute sneaker.  Unfortunately the were a strange fit.  My left baby toe felt like it was scrunched.  Right foot felt good.  Strange.  I returned
New_Balance,3,Really like the fit and support the shoe gives me. I was having knee pain from flat shoes and this shoe is snug and hugs the foot.
New_Balance,3,"Really like these shoes! But it doesn't have too much support on the bottom. Overpriced for what you kinda get, but I waited till they went on sale. I won't spend over $40 for these. If I am going to spend more than that then I need a shoe that will give me support and not feel like I'm walking on cement after a few weeks of wearing them. They have a nice look though."
New_Balance,3,Realmente muy cómodo y totalmente liviano. Espectacular.
New_Balance,3,"Received a defective pair, and Amazon for the first time in my history of being an avid shopper, -could not make it right.

 I purchased a half size larger based on many reviews stating you’d need to. They were way too large. I completed a return, and was given the simple option for an even exchange. (I’m guessing because the price was still the same. -THEN.

 I get the new pair, and they are a perfect fit, very comfortable- love the shoes, BUT- the left shoe’s lace  brackets are defectively sewn on, they are not sewn straight down the top of the foot, but off to the left, and at a left angle. The right bracket is almost top center of the foot, instead of on the side.

 This time, when trying to exchange, I was not given the option for an equal exchange, just a refund. I processed the refund, and planned to just purchased another exact pair/size. But, the price now jumped $25 more than what I paid, -more than half of what I paid for them.

I called customer service, and although the rep was very pleasant, I do not have anything negative to say against him, his hands were tied, - the system would not allow him to exchange them, (obviously because of the price hike) but I thought they’d be able to at least recreate the order with a price “adjustment” and take off the inflated difference, -but No.
 He could not do anything but offer me a $5 credit for the inconvenience, - which I didn’t accept at this point. I politely thanked him for his time, and didn’t take my frustration out on him, but this did upset me a little. I really wanted this pair of sneakers.

As far as the shoe, the shoe was GREAT, and this is why I’m upset. I finally found a comfortable shoe, that was a great fit, and very comfortable, but had the bad luck of receiving a defective pair. (I hope it was a fluke, and they are not a known batch of defective shoes, like people sell on eBay, - but DISCLOSE this info, and point out the defect.

So, I receive a defective item that’s at no fault of my own, and for once, -Amazon could not make it right."
New_Balance,3,Returned. But did find it at Bealls in 8 1/2.
New_Balance,3,"Reviews said you might need to size up, I wear a 7.5 so I got an 8 and they’re still too small. Hopefully I can exchange them without a problem bc the shoe itself is roomy (I got a wide size) and the insoles seem comfy from what I can tell. But if you order them definitely go up a full size."
New_Balance,3,Run much smaller than expected.  Not comfortable at all during my 12 hour shift.
New_Balance,3,Run short and not very much cushion on bottom layer.
New_Balance,3,"Run very small, order size up"
New_Balance,3,"Runs 2 sizes too small. I always wear 8.5, but I had to get a 9.5, which still felt snug."
New_Balance,3,Runs small
New_Balance,3,Runs too small I'm a 8 1/2
New_Balance,3,Shoe is a little narrow and it can have more cushion and arch support. Material is very thin and light. I walked outside this morning in the grass to my car and I could feel water hitting my socks on my toes. Probably wouldn't buy again because I was hoping for more support. Perfectly fine for someone to wear around the house or light activity.
New_Balance,3,Shoe is an little difficult to slip on and runs a little small. They are a nice looking shoe.
New_Balance,3,Shoe is cute but runs a full size too small. My daughter and I each got a pair and we each needed a full size larger than our normal size. The tongue in the shoe is stitched in so the fabric buckles and pinches the top of your foot where you tie the laces. Not my favorite pair but I wear them from time to time.
New_Balance,3,Shoe looks good and fits well. Only complaint is that I ordered new but they look like they had been worn previously as the bottom of the sole was dirty as if worn outside
New_Balance,3,"Shoe runs a little small/ narrow. Returned and half sized up , fit perfect then"
New_Balance,3,Shoe runs small.
New_Balance,3,"Shoe was very comfortable and fit as it should.  My issue is I do a lot of walking and I walked through the shoe in about six weeks and had to purchase new shoes. If you are not doing 17,000-18,000 steps a day like me the shoe is fabulous, if you walk a lot get a sturdier shoe."
New_Balance,3,Shoes are a bit tight. The rubber sole has fallen apart. Barely worn and its pealing off. My pair may be defective or it could be the shoe
New_Balance,3,"Shoes are comfortable, however they are slip-on and not lace.  Wish I had known that before purchase."
New_Balance,3,Shoes are slippery. Had to hold myself in the air while in the bathroom. Grip isn’t very good
New_Balance,3,Shoes look great but as soon as you take them out the box you can tell they are not wide. Nowhere on the shoe or the shoe box does it say it is wide. I am very disappointed because I have wide feet and these feel snug on my feet.
New_Balance,3,Shoes were a bit small had to return and get a bigger size then my usual. Love how they look but not to comfortable if you’re on your feet almost all day.
New_Balance,3,Size is not accurate
New_Balance,3,"Size up at least a half size, these seem to run small. The insole was cushy. Not sure how it’ll hold up though."
New_Balance,3,Size up if buying these shoes. Love the style but too small
New_Balance,3,Size was too small but Daughter like them
New_Balance,3,"Sizing was smaller than expected. I wear a 9.5 but needed to return the 9.5 and get a 10. The larger size doesn’t feel quite right, a little too loose in the toe box. These shoes are lightweight and surprisingly comfortable, but I’m disappointed by the overall fit."
New_Balance,3,Smaller than expected.
New_Balance,3,Smaller than normal sizing. Cheap fabric. Won't last. I guess you get what you pay for.
New_Balance,3,So disappointing and NB are my go to shoes. Ordered a 1/2 size bigger because I’m on my feet all day and quite often my feet are swollen at the end of the day. These were WAY too small.
New_Balance,3,"So I bought these due to the reviews and my job. I do retail construction and wanted new shoes for support and these were NOT it. I work 8hr shifts, constantly on my feet, on hard floors and they are a LOT less comfortable than skechers [with memory foam].

Heavily disappointed."
New_Balance,3,So if I could have the overall fit of a size 9.5 but length of a size 10 I would have given this 5 stars. For me the 10 feels to wide even when tightened with the laces. I order the 9.5 and it was perfect except to small for my big toe. I should have tried the 10s on before purchasing them but it is what it is. I have long narrow feet so I know my issue is a minority.
New_Balance,3,"So the picture on the right that includes the purchase date is what I thought I was getting, but picture on the left shows what I actually received. If they fit ok then I’ll keep them because I like when the bottom visual part of the shoe is dark, not white."
New_Balance,3,"So, my bad, I expected the usual substantial New Balance quality, but these are flimsy. They look nice, but I’m pretty disappointed."
New_Balance,3,"Sole of the shoe shrunk after two wears, no arch support, not for over or under pronation, they're lightweight but they are not for exercise/walking support. Not a lot of structure. They feel good as long as you're just wearing them for short distances. Not for long-term support."
New_Balance,3,"Something in the left shoe clicks everytime I take a step. It can be embarrassing at work. Otherwise I like these shoes. They were a bit snug around the foot the first few times, but I have narrow feet. I imagine they might be uncomfortable for anyone with wide feet though."
New_Balance,3,Started falling apartment just after a months use and I workout maybe 3x a week. Having to get a new pair already :/
New_Balance,3,"Such a bummer!  The shoes were feather light, good quality, comfortable and totally cute!  However, my heel would not stay in the shoe.  The material/fabric was not sturdy enough to hold my heels in place causing them to pop up with almost every movement.  Had to return.  😢"
New_Balance,3,Super comfortable
New_Balance,3,Super comfortable to work in especially if you're someone like me who works long hours however they are not non slip at all
New_Balance,3,Super comfy shoes
New_Balance,3,The “wide” I would say is average fit. I have normal width feet and one suffers from slight swelling at times so ordered a size up and in wide. For my left foot the shoe fit exact (the normal foot) and my right could not even get in. I will say the shoe was very light and super cute it’s a shame it did not work out.
New_Balance,3,The back came up and rubbed on my heel/ankle every step causing it to be very sore.
New_Balance,3,"The color was not as expected. I thought it was more beige with pink accent, but they are pink. I am a size 7 with a narrow foot, however the 7 fit snug. My toes are uncomfortable. I did not return because I bought them for a trip and wore them thinking they would break-in, but they are still tight. Other than the tight fit, the shoes are cute and supportive."
New_Balance,3,The heel of the sneaker is small and support is sucky
New_Balance,3,"The inner memory foam came apart t to easily and flattened out really fast. I like the fit and feel of the shoe the insole leaves a lot to be desired.
I really like New Balance sneakers and never wear anything else so you can imagine my disappointment when the insole was no longer any good."
New_Balance,3,The insert does not remove.  Have to put additional insert in as the one provided is terrible.  Would still buy again just know you have to supplement it with additional cushion
New_Balance,3,"The Instep was very low.. and I have a high I step! I could barely get them on
Very disappointing  because the shoe wS light and nice lookknf"
New_Balance,3,The label says wide width but it fits smaller.
New_Balance,3,The material is cheap. The fabric on the side tore open easily just from sliding across a tennis court ONCE. They're comfortable but quality is poor.
New_Balance,3,"The product ok, to simple, but ok
The delivery not good at all, could be lost"
New_Balance,3,"The product runs small so size up! If your feet aren’t narrow, you will have to get a bigger width. My feet are narrow and they were squeezed in pretty uncomfortably just at one use."
New_Balance,3,"The reviews when it comes to the critiques are mostly accurate. The toe box is slightly smaller, so I’d go half a size up. The sole is very thin and there is little to no arch support, to the extent that I bought them to workout in, and I’m now using them as a new form of indoor-only slippers."
New_Balance,3,The shoe felt like a slipper. Very light and soft.  I needed more support than the shoe had. I felt as if I could roll my ankle if I wore them long.
New_Balance,3,The shoe fits a little loose on the sides. The sole is also narrow for the shoe and provides little support. Its quite uncomfortable around the arch due to this. I would recommend potentially adding your own sole because they are comfortable in all other areas and also maybe size yourself down a half-size.
New_Balance,3,The shoe in itself is comfortable and fits true to size.. but it arrived with someone’s pet hair on the inside of the shoe!
New_Balance,3,"The shoe is nice looking, but really small. If you have more narrow foot, they will likely work fine for you."
New_Balance,3,The shoe is not true to size. I’m an adult and my feet aren’t getting any bigger. But I would have to get this shoe either a half inch or full inch bigger so my toes aren’t squashed. Never known shoes to run small. Comfortable fit in all other areas
New_Balance,3,"The shoe is ok.  I wear them to work, but I wouldn't try to exercise in them."
New_Balance,3,"The shoe is somewhere between a pull-on and a lace-up. I found the attached ""tongue"" uncomfortable on the top of my foot, because when you tighten the laces the fabric scrunches up on the sides. Also it runs slightly large compared to other New Balance shoes I have."
New_Balance,3,The shoe is very cute.  Looks great on.  Very lightweight.  The only thing I didn't like is that there is absolutely no support so I can't wear them for any length of time.
New_Balance,3,The shoes are adorable and look exactly as pictured however the sizing is incorrect. I ordered a 5 wide and although it says on the tag that it is a US 5 and a UK 3 I believe the sizes were mixed up and that it is actually a US 3. I have compared the shoe to several other pairs of my own shows as well as my daughters (size 2) and these shoes are in no way a size 5. This is not an instance were they run small they are incorrectly labeled so I would be very cautious before purchasing as the sizing is wrong.
New_Balance,3,"The shoes are cute and comfortable! The reason for the 3 stars is because after about 5 wears the tab on the back of the shoe ripped off. The shoe itself is still functional, but it doesn’t look nice and appears cheap to me."
New_Balance,3,The shoes are really comfortable just run REALLY small. I normally wear a 7.5 but ordered an 8 and they are still to small! Unfortunately I missed the return window!
New_Balance,3,The shoes are super cute and I own two other pairs now three. The shoes looked mostly new but one had dirt all over the bottom like someone had tried them on in a store. Disappointed they wouldn’t check there shoes before they sent out.
New_Balance,3,The shoes are very cute and they are a perfect fit. I ordered my exact size 5 1/2. If you're walking a short distance they'll be just fine however I was on vacation to New Orleans and walking around French Quarter as well as doing other things (all required walking) it was quite painful. They are lightweight but provide no support. As long as you're not looking for shoes for walking a super long distance I think these are perfect!
New_Balance,3,"The shoes do look like the photo, they just aren't the best for all day walking on concrete. I average 15,000 steps a day so these shoes are best suited for exercise sessions only, not all day wear. I love them!"
New_Balance,3,The shoes don’t have any cushion support on the bottom and not a lot of support
New_Balance,3,The shoes look great but they are very uncomfortable. So tight! You better wear long socks as well because the blisters are insane in these shoes.
New_Balance,3,The shoes ran small
New_Balance,3,"the shoes run small,  I wear 5 or 5  1/2  and these 5 1/2 are snug"
New_Balance,3,The shoes were a gift and she loved them!!
New_Balance,3,The sneaker runs smaller than expected. I always wear a size 7 sneaker and this sneaker is too small.
New_Balance,3,The sole is comfortable with the memory foam. I have a narrow foot but love new balance. The seam across the middle top part of the shoe is uncomfortable. Rubs my foot through the sock.
New_Balance,3,The toe area of the shoe is narrow and pinched me a bit so I didn't keep the. Nice style though.
New_Balance,3,"The toe box is too small causing my extra long 3rd toes to make contact with the front interior. Secondarily, the shoes do not offer the support I've come to expect from New Balance. (I remember the huge, klutzy looking New Balance shoes of yesterday. I owned a few pairs too. They weren't so streamlined, but they were supportive.) I bought these shoes for jumping rope, walking and casual basketball. I doubt they would hold up. They're probably great for the occasional lazy Saturday or Sunday where little walking is required, but definitely not a serious workout shoe. Will return."
New_Balance,3,"The tongue is stitched in, but oddly large. It bunches up and causes discomfort. The laces are long, even when tied for running, but that's not a big deal really. They look cute, but aren't nearly what I expect and enjoy from NB."
New_Balance,3,"The tongue is strange, seems too big for the shoe and sticks out somewhat, they are comfortable. The price was great, maybe that is why?"
New_Balance,3,"The way this shoe is made is very odd. I’ve actually purchased them twice thinking that the first pair must’ve been a mistake. The width by the toes and the top of the foot is great but near the arch and heel is incredibly narrow. While standing, I can actually feel the seams under my foot. Super bummed because otherwise I like this shoe a lot but I had to return."
New_Balance,3,"There weren't very many options for women with big wide feet for this shoe.  These were cute, too bad they didn't fit my feet well.  I ordered a 10 wide.  It was not wide enough and the length was not quite enough.  I was so looking forward to them."
New_Balance,3,These are cute and pretty comfortable for how low-tech they are. But the tab on the back of one of my shoes ripped off after half a dozen wears. For a slip-on sneaker one would think the pull-on tab would be better constructed/reinforced.
New_Balance,3,"These are cute, but be aware they do run small."
New_Balance,3,These are fairly comfortable but too narrow. Pretty frustrating when you order the wide size.
New_Balance,3,"These are featherlight, but do not provide much support at all."
New_Balance,3,These are for light walking... pretty flimsy and best used for light duty. I work at a restaurant and these do not hold up. Toe base runs small
New_Balance,3,These are just ok in comparison to the many other pair I have. They were smaller that I expected and the support is very average. They were cheap so I should have expected it I suppose. If you really cross train don’t waste your money. If you use machines then these are for you.
New_Balance,3,These are just okay. They are basically like a sock with a sole - super thin and no support. I wear these out and about for errands but wouldn’t rely on them for a walking shoe and definitely not for running.
New_Balance,3,"These are light weight and comfortable, but I was disapppinted that you can’t open the tongue on these shoes. I have a wide foot and I like laced shoes that are easy to put my foot in."
New_Balance,3,"These are light weight.  They are very breathable and get dirty easily and wet.  When they get wet, your socks get wet and then your feet get wet.  They also run very small.  I wear a 7 and after reading the reviews I ordered a half size up and they are still a little snug....but since I have worn them a few times they have adjusted and maybe stretched a bit so they are ok now.  There is not the typical NB support in these so if you are looking for a more structured shoe with good arch support these are not the best for you, but for travel and some walking around these are fine.  Since they are less than 30 dollars I think they are worth that.  Keep in mind that they do run small when ordering and they are not outdoor shoes when it is cold or wet outside."
New_Balance,3,"These are more like house slippers that madquerade as shoes. If you only intend to wear them at home they may last. I bought these for work and they squeaked incessantly, give no support, the foam support flattens quickly to nothing, and after just a few months of wearing the soles of the shoe are pealing apart."
New_Balance,3,These are my favorite sneakers. I have them in three different colors. They are so comfortable and I can easily wear them all day. The slip on design makes them easy to take on and off. I feel they run a little small so I usually order a half size larger than my normal shoe size.
New_Balance,3,"These are not slip resistant in the slightest, but I love the shoes."
New_Balance,3,"These are not true to size, order a half size up."
New_Balance,3,"These are slip-ons. I have major pronation issues in these shoes. It basically feels like my foot is slipping inwards as I walk (think Tommy Pickles). These shoes are definitely not good for runners or walkers. They’re good looking sneakers, but running errands is the extent of what should be done in these shoes."
New_Balance,3,These are so comfortable and so cute! I absolutely love them!!
New_Balance,3,"These are SO lightweight and comfortable! Just what I needed. They are easy to throw on. Although keep in mind the laces are attached in a way to the tongue, so if you have a narrow foot like me, ability to cinch them tight is limited."
New_Balance,3,"These are super comfy, fit true to size but just fit, can’t wear socks or they would be too small. I wanted some light gray shoes and these are the perfect shade, they’re BRIGHT just like I wanted! Cute with leggings or jeans, also very comfy and almost feel like wearing slippers."
New_Balance,3,"These are super cute and fit as expected, but they are really light with almost no support. After walking 2 miles in them my hips and legs are stiff and sore. I will definitely have to buy better inserts for them if I am going to spend much time wearing them."
New_Balance,3,"THESE ARE SUPER CUTE FOR WALKING AROUND, BUT DO NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR WORKING OUT.  ALSO HAD TO EXCHANGE AND ORDER 1 WHOLE SIZE LARGER BECAUSE THEY RUN SUPER SMALL."
New_Balance,3,These are super cute! And extremely comfortable! I’m normally a 7 but I would size up a half size in these sneakers. Otherwise the memory from insoles are a wonder for being on your feet all day!
New_Balance,3,"These are very comfortable for my feet but there is little support for working out. I found after a week, my feet were happy during my workout but my knees were feeling very sore. I had to stop wearing them for working out but will wear them for walking only."
New_Balance,3,"These are very cute and fit length and width the way it should I wear a 7.5 wide and that's what I ordered. Buuuut the arch part on the inside of the sole is too narrow. The actual part where my foot is was pretty comfortable, but it felt like my feet were being pushed inward like they were sliding sideways down a ramp. I feel like doing much in these would likely cause an ankle to be rolled. Also, they are super squeaky. Maybe that would go away after some time on the pavement, but on stained concrete, wood, or tile it's pretty distracting and painful to the ears."
New_Balance,3,These aren't nearly as comfortable as I expected based on the reviews. I waited too long and can no longer return them so I'll have to but some insoles to add some cushioning.
New_Balance,3,These fit true to size and are super light weight! However these have rubbed a blister on the back of my feet!!
New_Balance,3,"These run small & narrow, the wide was like a normal width shoe.  The insoles are also glued in so I couldn’t add arch supports."
New_Balance,3,"These run VERY small. I'm usually an 11.5 but end up buying 12's when a half size isn't available, and these 12's were too small for me to even get on. I'd say they run an entire size small."
New_Balance,3,"These seem v comfy and lightweight and I wanted to keep them. However, I ordered a size 7 which correlates to a size 5 uk which always fits me. When they arrived, I noticed they said size 37.5 eu size and 5 uk size which is incorrect, a size 5 is a 38, so these are basically a 4.5 UK size and are too small for me!"
New_Balance,3,"These seemed like they'd be comfortable to wear and are super light with a good sole cushion. They run very short, though. My 6.5M Mom got these and while she wears a true 6.5 or slightly less, her big toe was touching the front of the shoe. It was like a true 6.5M in all other respects except way too short. We'll try a 7 and see if that's too big or not."
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are a much wider fit than I would have expected. You can’t tighten the laces enough to pull the sides of the shoe tighter. I ordered an 8 1/2, and I feel like if I order a size 8 they would be too short, but they are very wide and I couldn’t run in these or do active sports if I wanted to"
New_Balance,3,these shoes are adorable but run small . I normally wear a 7.5 but these are to small  . I actually forgot to return and they are sitting in my closet now.
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are comfortable and lightweight. However, just after two months of wearing them, the sides are tearing. The material is thin and not durable at all."
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are comfortable, stylish, and affordable. I’m already ordering in another color."
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are cute and would be great for running errands as long as you’re not on your feet for an extended amount of time. They’re a Very lightweight shoe with minimal support especially under the ball of the foot. Would not be good for any strenuous activity such as jogging, lifting weights, or even constant standing, as shoes would not support or protect the foot."
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are light and comfortable if you like little arch support. Might be a good shoe to walk in but if you’re looking for a shoe for high impact, definitely not the shoe for you."
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are lite and airy which is great, unfortunately the width is not. I ordered wide and must have gotten narrow or something because they were so small. Very disappointing."
New_Balance,3,These shoes are not for running. Make sure you get a size up. They were too tight for me.
New_Balance,3,These shoes are not good at all for any type Of exercise. Maybe something just to wear and slip on if your in a rush
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are really thin. The sides are see-through. I happen to like that because it allows my feet to breathe. The memory foam is nice but flattens easily. I never considered my feet to be wide but these fit very snug, which I also like. However they might cut off circulation. I bought some inserts and they were too small. Overall the quality seemed cheaper than what I’d expect considering what I paid for them"
New_Balance,3,These shoes are so cute and stylish.  the support in the shoe is near nothing!  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this for a New Balance product which I have worn for years.
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are so nice looking! I absolutely love them but I definitely feel like they run small. I usually wear a 9W, I ordered a 9.5W and still a bit snug."
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are sporty looking and go well with jeans.  They fit comfortably and are properly sized.  The sole is quit spongy, so your walk is ""very soft"".  Also, the sides of the shoe are not firm.  So, they are okay for short-term wear, but don't count on them to be comfortable all day.  I would not wear these for any active sports, since they provide no bracing or structure.  I am afraid you would turn your ankle if you were playing active sports.  I found that I missed the leather sides that many athletic shoes use.  For looks--I give it a 5-star rating.  For toughness and active wear--I wouldn't recommend them."

New_Balance,3,"These shoes are super cute!! I purchased them to wear to Disney World and will probably still wear them but had to add an insert in them. I ordered the wide because I like a little bit more room in my shoes (even though I do not need to order wide shoes) but these are super narrow. The padding inside hits just inside my arch so it's super annoying. When I add my own insert it makes it much better but I shouldn't have to add something to be able to wear these shoes. If you have narrow feet, these will be great for you but if you have wide feet, these will be uncomfortable."
New_Balance,3,These shoes are very comfy and look so nice! I’ve worn them for HIIT multiple times and really felt great. My only complaint is that the second time I wore them I noticed the bottom sole has a loose piece that sometimes gets caught on the floor when I’m walking/exercising. Disappointing for shoes that should be good quality. I’ve included pics for example (they’re already dirty from hiking).
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are very cute and are probably very comfortable, but they run almost a size and a half too small. I have another pair, different style but same brand, and when compared side by side, these looked like a size 5."
New_Balance,3,These shoes are very light and easy to walk in. They do not have a lot of support for running in.
New_Balance,3,These shoes are very light weight. I would've liked a bit more cushioning because I bought them for standing on cement floor. Nice shoes to wear for casual stuff. They felt like air. I liked them. Not bulky or heavy.
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are very lightweight, cute and easy to put on. Negatives: run small and not supportive enough. Since I was experiencing arch pain while on long walks, I bought these because of the positive reviews. I think these shoes are better for the gym, not for walks over a mile."
New_Balance,3,"These shoes are very nice for day to day casual wear. However, they are not made for running or for a hard workout."
New_Balance,3,"These shoes felt great to slip on. Loved them until I walked around the house a while and I realized there was not enough sole support under the pad of the foot to go on even a mile walk. Would have worked to wear shopping, but I needed a pair to go for at least a 2or3 mile walk. I returned them."
New_Balance,3,These shoes look nice and look like they could be very comfortable but beware if you need a wide size. They are not wide at all. They come with a little tag zip tied on the shoe again claiming “wide” but the sole is VERY narrow and the sizing tag inside the shoe does not indicate they are wide either. Pretty disappointed.
New_Balance,3,"These shoes run at least a half size small. Even though I could not really walk in them because they were too small, there did not seem to be any cushioning either."
New_Balance,3,These shoes run small i got my size 7.5 my toes hurt instantly should have ordered an 8 they can be comfortable sizing up think im going to give these away and order a next size
New_Balance,3,"These sneakers are very light and comfortable, but much smaller than I had anticipated.  The fit is perfect, but I ordered a half size up as I usually do for walking sneakers.  I wore them with a sock and they were tight.  They'll be nice for the summer without socks- I may order the larger size wide width to allow for more room for a sock."
New_Balance,3,"These sneaks are very stylish and I get a lot of compliments on them. Unfortunately, they’re about as supportive as a high quality pair of socks."
New_Balance,3,These were not as comfortable as I was expecting from the New Balance brand. Not good for wearing long days.
New_Balance,3,"These were on the small size and I ordered my regular size.  Also, they come up high on the arch and were very tight and uncomfortable for me so I gave them away.  I am not flat footed but I don't have a particularly high arch."
New_Balance,3,These were too small for me. I ordered my normal size and couldn't fit my foot in the shoe. This was my first ever new balance purchase so I'm not sure if they run small. They had a cute design
New_Balance,3,These were very cute and very comfortable.  But they are definitely not good workouts.  I also didn’t like how much sock was showing when wearing them.
New_Balance,3,"They are beautiful , but fit me a bit tight I should’ve gotten a size up or maybe a wider shoe. I still love them and will wear them!"
New_Balance,3,They are comfortable but I am a bit disappointed that the color name “Pigment” is a shade of blue while the image looks black. I already destroyed the box and removed the tags but I really wanted a pair of black and gold shoes
New_Balance,3,"They are comfortable, but slide off my heal. Too large."
New_Balance,3,"They are cute and comfortable. Except for the fact they run small even though I ordered a half size larger they are still a bit small. And the back rubs into my ankle, I have to have a bandaid to protect my heal.
Hoping that goes away the more I wear them!"
New_Balance,3,They are cute but not very supportive
New_Balance,3,They are light and comfortable but I could never wear them standing all day at work. I have skinny feet and there is a lot of room on the top of the shoe. So when I tighten the laces there’s gapping.
New_Balance,3,They are nice but do run small. 😔 I would definitely size up. Other than that they are comfy and cute for the price.
New_Balance,3,"They are nice looking shoes, however the sides are very low and it's easier to roll your ankle. I bought an 8 but they felt a bit smaller."
New_Balance,3,They are not as comfortable as the fuel core. Memory foam does not really conform to shape of foot. First time I have ever been disappointed in a New Balance product. Outside material is nice and I like the design of the shoe. Comfort trumps it all so sadly I am returning them.
New_Balance,3,They are OK but doesn’t have the cushion I was hoping for. Won’t last too long as a comfortable shoe to walk the dog in
New_Balance,3,"They are OK without socks.

I bought a second pair at a larger size....."
New_Balance,3,They are pretty soft and there's only two slots for lacing up so my foot doesn't feel very secure in the shoe. They look super cute but don't hold up well in a high intensity workout.
New_Balance,3,They are super cute but the wear for me is awful. No support and very uncomfortable
New_Balance,3,"They are ultimately going back because they are a 1/2 size too small. However, I received them with a $40 Marshalls tag attached yet they are being sold for $60+"
New_Balance,3,"They fit pretty grea in most areas, ,  BIG thing was the toe area was too low.  I am an in-store shopper so I walk a lot, And my big toes hurt!  The bottom of my feet though did not."
New_Balance,3,They look great but soles are too thin - no Cush.
New_Balance,3,They look navy to me and gave me blisters the first time I wore them.
New_Balance,3,"They look nice, but they're so light that it feels like there isnt a lot of support. I bought these 8 months pregnant hoping they would help but my feet hurt worse in these than they do in my slip on shoes."
New_Balance,3,"They run small, I'd size up."
New_Balance,3,They seem to me like their cut small and not my actual size..I don't know If they are not the right size..I had worn them already!!!..Can't send them back..
New_Balance,3,"They were really tight and narrow. I actually have pretty narrow feet and these were uncomfortable. Also, there was nothing to the top of them - I have a large dog who often steps on my toes and these did not protect my toes."
New_Balance,3,They’re super cute and we’re a bit smaller than expected. When I opened them the shoes had hairs in them...? Kinda gross. I’m a nurse and I wouldn’t not suggest wearing these for 12 hours. They’re very comfortable at first but my feet and back are hurting by midway through my shift.
New_Balance,3,"This is definitely not the quality I would expect from New Balance. I have a similar version of the women's FuelCore and it is much more supportive and stable. This shoe just feels a little cheap and I get a noticeable pronation.The laces are overly long and it would take a great deal of effort to lace them so that they look neat; bought some Hickies laces. I suppose they were a good value since NB site store sells them for $64.95, but really they were hardly worth the $40 something Amazon charged."
New_Balance,3,"This is my third pair of these sneakers. I previously purchased the same black pair and loved them so much that I bought them in gray and black when it came time to replace them. One thing that is annoying is that the liner under your foot detaches from the shoe and comes out when you take them off. On my first pair I thought it was just me. But it happens with my second pair of black ones. The gray ones are fine, no issues.

I am very picky about sneakers because I need a lot of support. I can walk in these all day with no knee or lower back pain. Definitely recommend!"
New_Balance,3,"This is the cutest shoe ever… But there is absolutely no arch support and the inside of each shoe sort of rolls inward - if that makes any sense at all! My feet have an average width & a little higher Arches than the normal person, and I have never had a shoe that fits like this one! It does run about a half a size small but I wear between an 8 1/2 and 9 anyway, so I ordered a nine and it fits like an 8 1/2 which is OK with me! I am determined to make these shoes fit comfortably because they are so cute… So I am buying some arch supports and I’m hoping it will help. But like I said, the entire inner part of the shoe kind of rolls inward, so I’m not sure if it’s going to help that much. I will come back and update my review once I get the right insoles and try the shoe out! So for now I’m giving it three stars because they are so cute and fit pretty decently, but I’m hoping to up the stars to five soon!!"
New_Balance,3,This NB shoe runs small both width & length. I'll have to return it.
New_Balance,3,"This shoe definitely feels like it runs smaller, at least in the wide width compared to other new balance shoes of the same size.  I think the elastic that is around the top and side of the shoe makes the overall fit feel tight.  If you don’t wear socks, I think it fits just fine.  If you wear socks, you may need to go 1/2 size up.  Also I don’t think it offers a lot of support on the bottom even though it has the memory foam insert.  The shoe is very light weight and looks great.  I am happy with the purchase but will not be buying another pair."
New_Balance,3,"This shoe has a one piece construction, the tongue is not separate and won't work with a high arch. Also the toe box is short and put pressure on the top of my big toes. Did not work for me at all."
New_Balance,3,"This shoe is suitable for limited walking.  Not suited for over 5,000 steps or so.  A good switch up shoe to avoid putting too much wear out of my tried and true walking shoe.  Very limited arch support, but a stretchy comfortable shoe."
New_Balance,3,"This shoe is super cute and I wanted to like it.  I am a true 6 and this size 6 was on the tight side.  Also it offered very little support.  But if you're just looking for a cute basic sneaker, this could be just fine for you."
New_Balance,3,"This shoe is very cute and looks good on the foot. However, they won't last long. After one wear, the white foam sole is clearly squished to the point of creasing; and the memory foam insole is not supported by a firm arch support base, so it just squishes down and offers no support at all. These are okay for walking around town, but they are not the shoe for someone on their feet for long periods of time.

Additionally, the shoe runs short. I ordered a half size up to begin with, and I had to return them for a full size larger than I usually wear."
New_Balance,3,This type of shoes were hard to put on and very tight around the middle of the foot.
New_Balance,3,"This was my 3rd pair is this type of shoe, and the cushion and support is not like it used to be. My first pair was amazing walking all over Disney back in 2018.  I won’t be buying anymore of these from Amazon."
New_Balance,3,"Toes are scrunched, shoulda looked at other reviews and ordered a size up. I usually get a 7.5 in nikes and they fit but I like extra room so I order an 8.
I ordered an 8 in these and they don’t even fit like a 7.5 in nikes."
New_Balance,3,Too large
New_Balance,3,Too small
New_Balance,3,Too small and too stiff to be a comfortable shoe.
New_Balance,3,"Too small, I bought a size 6 and they don't fit me. Buy a bigger size."
New_Balance,3,Unfortunately these sneakers were a disappointment as far as their fit. They were a bit too tight esepcially in the toe area (and I have a relatively small foot) even though I ordered a 1/2 size larger and was not impressed with the arch support. I thought New Balance could have done a better job.
New_Balance,3,UPDATE..had these for a few months and the soles are wearing out. Not so great now****Of course return time is up****Great walking shoes. Toe room  is perfect.
New_Balance,3,Usually wear a 6.5 in Nike and I need a 7 in these.
New_Balance,3,Very comfy but you definitely need to size up half a size. I have NEVER had to size up even when things say to. And this is the first time I've regretted it. I had to return. Hoping the 7.5 fits better.
New_Balance,3,"Very comfy shoe but fits small and very narrow at the toe, recommend going a half size bigger."
New_Balance,3,Very cute . Run small. I wish I had gotten an 8 instead of a 7.5
New_Balance,3,Very cute and good for short wear. I’ve been wearing it on my 5 to 6 hour shifts and my feet kill me every single day. But the shoes fit well.
New_Balance,3,"Very cute and lightweight. Not sure these will be more than a fashion statement, but i haven't done more than try them on and they seem comfortable enough to run errands and a day out when I want to be comfortable. Wear a shoe 7 1/2 and ordered an 8. I have thin feet and ankles and the 8 was snug -toes almost touching the front of the shoe. returned and ordered an 8 1/2."
New_Balance,3,Very cute shoes!  Loved the color.  I usually wear an 8 or 8-1/2.  I ordered a 9 and they are still too small.
New_Balance,3,"Very disappointed, i didn't know it was made of fabric; not very easy to put on"
New_Balance,3,"Very good product, size was perfect, very lightweight, comfortable.
The price was right."
New_Balance,3,Very light weight and comfortable for casual wear. They would not suit me as a running shoe but I knew that before I ordered them. Good shoe for the price.
New_Balance,3,"Very light weight would be good general short term walking shoe.  Not as supportive as Kuru, but 1/3 price as well"
New_Balance,3,VERY lightweight.
New_Balance,3,"Very little stability or support for workouts.  If you just need it for work or walking, not a bad choice."
New_Balance,3,Very thin. Definitely not for serious runners. Wouldn’t even suggest for walking because they are so thin. I would say this shoe is only for looks
New_Balance,3,Waaaaay too small unfortunately. I had to return. Bummer.
New_Balance,3,"Wanted a basic shoe to wear when running errands or when out and about. Wanted a Shoe that is easy to put on and take off. This shoe met most of the requirements but I had to put in an insole in order for it to be comfortable and wearable.

This shoe is not proper for walking or running. The sole is very thin and offers no support."
New_Balance,3,Was super excited to get my shoes but when they arrived i put them on the fit was right but the nect day i was going to wear them for a walk when i started to notice that the left shoes towards the center it felt like limpy (sole) very uncomfortable to walk it bugged soooo much i had to return item . Also shoes shouldn't be more than $30 for the quality
New_Balance,3,WAY too small!  I own a pair of size 11 New Balance and these look like these are a size 9.  I think I would’ve liked them otherwise.
New_Balance,3,"We have Covid right now, but I'm waiting and then returning these, as they're too tight. I ordered a half size up and still too small."
New_Balance,3,"While these shoes are comfortable the soles are not very firm and have compressed over time. I have been wearing the shoes on daily, 10k step walks on paved paths.  After three months the soles have compressed enough that the shoes are no longer very comfortable to wear - especially in the heel.  While they aren't bad shoes, I hate that they were only good for three months of regular wear and will need to be replaced."
New_Balance,3,Work shoes not bad for the price.
New_Balance,3,You need special socks if you don't want them to be seen. Even my no shows are seen from the low cut side. It's really weird. The door leaves are super long! They're almost no reason for them except to tighten the top of the does which just makes the shoe fit even more awkward. So I leave them loose and I don't run in them. They're more a walking shoe not a running shoe.
New_Balance,3,"You will definitely need an additional insoles for arch support and..... for shock absorption.  The strings are short, but they are made from a material that stays tied pretty much.  The strings and other portion of the shoes are reflective.  Nice styling, BUT I would not recommend them because of the trouble of finding the right insoles."
Nike,3,"Actually, I returned the sneakers.....loved the look, but not the front half of the foot fit.  I was disappointed, because I love the appearance of the shoe, as well as the Nike brand."
Nike,3,"Amazon suggested I get a 7 1/2. The shoes were too small. Unable to get them in a larger size. I’m not sure if these are authentic Nikes? The bronze check looks as if someone just stamped it on the side.Otherwise, the fit and support from a narrow foot was there they were just too small."
Nike,3,"As someone with wide feet it’s hard to find cute good quality walking shoes. I bought this in my usual size 9 W wide width and to compare I got the asics gel excite 7 since that brand is known for fitting wide feet comfortably. The nikes were comfortable straight out of the box, but I could feel the side of my foot already stretching over the edge of the footbed. The material is quite breathable and stretchy so I’m not sure how long it’ll take for me to wear down the sides. Also in the inside heel portion of the shoe insert just seems like it’ll give out and become loose. Overall it’s a good casual shoe, I wouldn’t run or go long distances with these and expect them to hold up for a long time. They are as advertised a good casual shoe to run errands. The ASICS have a sturdier exterior, not much stretch but they do fit my wide feet comfortably. I feel secure when walking/ jogging. If you have wide feet and want something casual then the Nikes are great. For more athletic shoes go with ASICS. They’re not as cute as these Nikes but your feet will thank you."
Nike,3,As soon as I looked at these I could tell these are a knock off. NOT A REAL NIKE. still cute. My 7 year old doesnt care and loves them. But they are not real nike. I dont know how long they will last but seem decent enough for a year old girl.
Nike,3,Average
Nike,3,"Bought these as work shoes, since the running shoes dont tend to feel very comfy as standing shoes. Was not impressed with these."
Nike,3,Comfortable to wear! However I didn’t like the front toe area there is no support and after a few wears the toe area pops out.
Nike,3,Don't know if they are real.....
Nike,3,"Everything fit but after 3 months the shoes are falling apart. Big holes in the toe. This is unexpected for Nike so wondering if Trend Essentials, the store that shipped,  has a knock off shipment or are selling fakes."
Nike,3,First of all I got it with a repacks box. Then what I see is the shoes just randomly tossed in the box with no any brand attached on. Shoelaces are messy which looks like someone wears it before. I’m not satisfied!
Nike,3,"Fits great; looks great - however, they are not very supportive and my feet hurt after 2 hours into my work shift. Disappointed."
Nike,3,Great pair of shoes but I suggest getting them from a different seller. These arrived loose in a bag not in its original box. Had these been a gift id have been livid. I was lucky and they arrived undamaged but it could have easily turned out worse.
Nike,3,"Have to get a half size bigger, not because they don't fit.. But because you can see the lining on my toes which I don't like"
Nike,3,"I didn’t like the shoe when I received it I was disappointed ,because I was looking for the tanjun women sneakers for a while now.When I received the shoe I was so pissed ,because it was not what I had expected.I didn’t return the shoe I give it a friend."
Nike,3,"I fractured my ankle and was trying to find a pair of shoes with a supportive heel. I already had a pair like these. I want a pair with more support, I chose to return these."
Nike,3,I love these shoes to wear around. I wore them so much I put a hole in the toes on my previous pair.
Nike,3,"I was expecting red but the shoes are a neon orange. However, they are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever had!"
Nike,3,"I will get it later if it is not too much to you and also if I can have a look at the meeting on Thursday at least a chance to ask for the day and then I'll start looking into your beautiful smile and say you are not too much to ask for, NIKE Tanjuns."
Nike,3,I would give these shoes a 5 star but there is what appears to be glue all around the edge of the shoe. It is a little disappointing but other wise nice.
Nike,3,"I would have rated these a 5 star however the shipping took a very long time especially since I paid additional shipping costs since this seller does not offer the amazon free shipping but instead  charges additional shipping and handling. I paid the additional shipping charges March 1st and STILL did NOT receive them until today March 17th.  Too long and should include free shipping because of the time involved sending and receiving them. They are quite nice Authentic and very comfortable as well as  true to size .  These really are a quality product you can use for everyday, including errands, walking (exercise), working out at gym or home  but not for running or jogging. I will follow up in a few months on the durability and if these are still comfortable. They are SO lightweight on your feet which is quite nice on a busy day. Enjoy!"
Nike,3,I wouldn't use it for a work shoe.
Nike,3,"It fits but I just have to break them in, it's pressure on the top of my foot"
Nike,3,"It took almost a month for these shoes to arrive and when they finally did, the box was almost completely destroyed. The shoes are perfect though so overall, I'm happy with the product. I don't usually ding a review for presentation, I was honestly more irritated that they took so long to get to me."
Nike,3,It was pretty much whhat my daughter wanted
Nike,3,"It's more expensive than nike.com....
I knew that later that I already bought it.. so sad...
But Shoe is really good"
Nike,3,Liked the style and comforter but to short lengthwise
Nike,3,"Love the look and fit of these shoes and the fact that they're light weight/cool. However, within a week of wearing them I can see major wear on the toes of the shoes. My son is and 8 y/o, but this is the first Nike (or other shoe brand) that has fallen apart so quickly."
Nike,3,Me encantaron solo k no me kedaron
Nike,3,Most comfortable shoes I’ve own but I got a whole in both toes way prematurely. Super comfy so it was a shame.
Nike,3,Nice and light. Toes are going to show by wearing out if you wear these often. This is a just for show shoe.
Nike,3,"Nice enough tennis shoe, but very, very narrow.  Returned immediately."
Nike,3,"Nice shoes, but swoosh came with sticky stuff/mark up on it."
Nike,3,"Nice sneakers but runs small, I ordered my regular size 6 1/2 but the sneakers were small. I returned them."
Nike,3,"Not impressed, not the fit or quality I usually get with Niki , already donated them ."
Nike,3,Ordered a 3 and fit larger than other nike shoes my daughter has
Nike,3,"Picked mauve, thought it would be pinkish/purple.  Turns out to be brown."
Nike,3,Popular shoe but runs small. Had to return.
Nike,3,"Pretty mediocre shoes, hurt my back and wore out complete with holes on the TOP in less than a year. No grip on the bottom."
Nike,3,Really great shoes except for the security sensor still attached. The box was also torn and held together with a rubber band. It kind of makes me wonder if these were stolen and being resold. Sketchy. The shoes themselves are great other than the sensor. They are comfortable and super light. I am in need of them now so I guess I’ll try to get the sensor off.
Nike,3,"Received my shoes in a timely manner and fit true to size.  However, there was a security tag on the shoe which seemed strange to me.  Was it stolen?  Did they grab it off a store shelf and forget to remove it?  idk.  Anyway I had to go to the local outlet and have them remove it.  Whole point of me ordering the shoes online was to avoid going to the store.  Guess that didn't work out well."
Nike,3,"Sent the wrong color, returned"
Nike,3,Shoes did not fit and I had to return them. This seller's return policy is terrible (which they say is stated up front but I did not see).  That aside they felt comfortable but did not feel they would last long with constant wear
Nike,3,Some portions of the glue is showing on the front and sides.
Nike,3,"The color Solar red is misleading I thought they would be red on the brighter side but they are an odd orange/red florescent color.
I like it so I'm keeping them just not what I expected."
Nike,3,"The shoe is comfortable, but the color is not even close to being red or so called atomic red its neon pink!"
Nike,3,"The shoes fit okay in the foot bed, but they require an insult to be comfortable. The laces don't tie very high on the top of the foot so the heel feels a little bit insecure, but I'm only using them for an in-home gym for light weight lifting."
Nike,3,"The tongue of this shoe is pretty cheap. It's a small gripe, but it is something that you notice immediately. Also, the arch support is pretty week. I wouldn't wear these to actually run in, but they are comfortable enough and look good to just wear out and about while running errands or something."
Nike,3,"These are comfortable, but would not use them for running.  Thin insoles, no lace locks."
Nike,3,These are one of the most comfortable shoes I’ve warm.
Nike,3,"These are one pair of good looking shoes that skimp in the they-feel-like-a-well-made-product department. Some of what was subtracted to makes these shoes light weight, and they are that, compromises my three stars rating so I should stop writing before I change it to two."
Nike,3,"These run small, get a bigger size! They’re narrow and run small. In order to be comfortable I had to get a size 8 instead of my regular size 7."
Nike,3,These shoes did not feel as I expected! Not enough cushion or arch support!
Nike,3,"These shoes fit as expected. They are very comfortable and very lightweight. Brand new, they were very stylish. I really enjoyed the shoes. That being said,

I bought these for work. I'm in IT and our floors are concrete. If I walk in the city for lunch, it's less than 1mile a day on sidewalk, if at all.

After about 5 months of daily semi-daily wear to work (where I mostly sit down), the tread on the bottom of these shoes disappeared. The lightweight effect is a trade-off for durable tread.

Nike's shoes made for walking/running never did this to me (except for long distance hikes for 1-2 years). I was walking on the sidewalk a morning after rain the night before and fell flat on my ass! The tread is mostly worn off the in the parts where there is 0 visible remaining tread, there are actually divers which I believe are capable of growing into actual holes.

Overall, I liked the shoes, but considering I didn't put a lot of miles on them, I would have liked to get more than 5 months for a $60 pair of shoes."
Nike,3,They fit
Nike,3,Very comfortable but the fabric at the toes has already gotten a hole in it. And I hardly have wore them.
Nike,3,"Very comfortable, good fit. However, the fabric needs to be stronger.  After six months, my big toes went thru the fabric,
and now there's a hole.  For the price, the shoe fabric should last longer. I wore them a few times a week, not all day, and not everyday."
Nike,3,"Very comfortable, I am a little upset because the shoe seems to have been worn before I got them."
Nike,3,Very cute but does not give much support making it uncomfortable to wear all day or even a few hours. More for the style
Nike,3,We bought for my son and my younger daughter ended up with them. We always buy bigger for under armour but this didnt work out for him. My daughter wears a whole size smaller than my son.
Nike,3,Width is tighter than other nikes I’ve bought and the toes are tight.
Nike,3,Wish they were like regular sneakers. The sneaker doesn’t open and the sides of the tongue is attached to the sneaker. Wouldn’t order again. Does wash well in the washer.
Nike,3,Zero arch support really makes it difficult to look forward to walking wearing these sneakers... Tad bit snug I need to wear my thinnest peds to have them not be too tight. I’m an 8-81/2 I got the 81/2’s.
UA,3,A good looking shoe but too small
UA,3,"Color is a light to medium grey, not dark as pictured."
UA,3,Cómodos...lo malo y terrible es que uno es más pequeño que el otro =( y como soy de sudamerica no puedo hacer cambio
UA,3,Cuts into back of the ankle if you don't wear above ankle socks. It took some time to get use to them.
UA,3,"Decent shoe for the price. Great for an on-your-feet-all-day-long kind of shoe, but not good enough for distance running. Not enough cushion or ankle support for my taste."
UA,3,Fits small. I made the mistake of wearing them outside otherwise I would have returned them. They are a bit small and are slightly uncomfortable to wear.
UA,3,Good but kinda cheap feeling and no arch support I kept them but not my go to shoes
UA,3,"Good fit, comfortable. Wrong color."
UA,3,"great product, will buy again"
UA,3,Hurts my heal on left shoe.  They seem a half size off so order accordingly...to tight.
UA,3,I am a true woman 9.5 shoe size which is what I ordered.  I can wear them for short periods of time because they are just a tad short.  I wouldn't order these again and will look for a different brand.
UA,3,"I am almost always a size 10 - sometimes a 10 is even a little big in athletic shoes. So, I of course ordered a 10 in this shoe, but it was too tight in the toes. It's too bad, because they seemed like they would be comfortable. I wish they had a 10 1/2, but they don't."
UA,3,I bought these sneakers a couple days ago and have run in them twice. I love the way they look and they felt great when I first put them on. But now they are greatly bothering the outside of my right ankle bone. Anyone else had this problem?
UA,3,"I bought this pair of shoed because my husband has a pair and loves them. However, they were so uncomfortable and hurt my feet so much that I had to return them. I can't recommend them. They fit a little larger than expected and my feet felt like rolled inwards too much with these shoes."
UA,3,I don’t believe these shows are so stiff & as a runner I need support & arch added fo support in the shoes. Went up a size but still too much room. Works well if you wear THICK socks. I don’t Wish it was comfortable ! After one month my ankles hurt. Husband has UA pair his is softer & not tough like my UA pair. Wish I could have returned. But tossed out show box after realizing it was the shoes giving me trouble.
UA,3,I don’t have an issue with the product… It’s just that it didn’t work for us… Our daughter is special needs and she has braces on her feet the braces even though they fit pretty well… They sadly were too wide for the shoe and then overall the shoe was just too small and narrow and it did not work for her braces to fit comfortably. Had to return
UA,3,"I got these shoes for Christmas in late December and i noticed in March that in the toe area the mesh was coming off. I do not wear these shoes more than 3 or 4 days a week so I find it odd. It makes me feel like the material is cheap, the shoe itself is really comfortable however, I am unsure if I would buy this product again."
UA,3,"I had high hopes. Unfortunately, these are at least a half size too small, and they have absolutely no arch support. Other than that, they fit well. My heel does not rise out of the back of the shoe, and the fabric is comfortable against my feet. I usually wear a 7 1/2, these are eight and my toes hit the front. They are going back."
UA,3,I like the shoe but it is not the color that is shown in the picture.
UA,3,"I love the shoe color, comfort  and support. But it was some oil stains on the front of the  right shoe. Just didn't want to go thur the trouble of returning them my trip was in 2 days and I needed them to work out on the trip."
UA,3,"I love these shoes after sending back the first pair. Ended up with a full size bigger than usual. Been using them for work, aerobics and golf."
UA,3,"I normally wear a 6, I bought these is a 6-1/2, they are too small.  I am trying to exchange for a 7 but I can only get the option to return:("
UA,3,I normally wear and 8 or 81/2.  I had to get a 9 in these.  They are also narrow.  I was expected more support.
UA,3,"I ordered 8.5, which is typically a size I can wear depending on the shoe, I can also fit in an 8. I ordered the 8 and it was just too tight, so I sent it back and got the 8.5. Still too tight. So my recommendation is to go to the next full size up if your ordering. Othewise, shoe well made, I am still using them to work out for the 2 hrs, but to wear them all day, no."
UA,3,I ordered the black and white as pictured and the all black was delivered. They are also too small. I always wear a size 7 and would definitely need to size up a half size for these sneakers.
UA,3,I ordered what was pictured.  The shoe I received is very light gray.  It will get dirty quickly.
UA,3,I purchased these shoes based on reviews that stated they ran true to size. I was really disappointed when I tried them on and they were too short! I rarely wear any shoe larger than a 7. So I will return them and try a 71/2.
UA,3,"I thought I was getting a black shoe with a white sole. I got an all-black shoe. The size is fine; the comfort is fine. They're a little clunkier than I thought they would be--they feel a little heavy. Was hoping for something a little lighter. Being all black, they look a little heavy on your foot too. I wish they'd been as pictured with the white sole and white logo."
UA,3,I typically wear a 7.5 and 8 is tight on my foot with this shoe
UA,3,I was no longer able to find the charged 2 shoe so I ordered these no where near as comfortable or supportive as my other one. These have harder soles and make my feet hurt after wearing. Don’t recommend this one.
UA,3,"I was super excited to get a great deal on these shoes, but was disappointed when I received them. They are very comfortable - I will give them that - but it's a very tall, bulky shoe compared to all of my Nike shoes. It made my feet look large and awkward so I decided to return them."
UA,3,I wear 8.5 should of ordered a 9 these run small
UA,3,"I wish these shoes were a bit wider. Otherwise, no complaints."
UA,3,I wouldn’t buy these to run in for long term or for longer runs. They are a cheaper shoe. I switched them over and just use them as an ever shoe..
UA,3,"I’m always an exact 8, I don’t go up or down depending on shoe type or brand. These feel smaller than 8. Tight and difficult to break in. Most workout shoes will have skittle of that but these aren’t easy to run in. Definitely just for walking."
UA,3,"I’m still working on breaking these in, however these are the first pair of tennis shoes I’ve ever had to break in. They’re rather stiff and the backs rub against my ankles painfully. I am hoping once broken in they will be a bit more comfortable.

I think they fit true to size. They are a cute pair of shoes and I will wear them for running errands or walking but as a runner I definitely would not wear these for running. Not a whole lot of support in these."
UA,3,"I’ve been wearing these sneakers for 4 months now. Unfortunately a few weeks ago my big toes made holes in both sneakers. Why? Unsure. They were a perfect fit; not too big, not too small, but they ripped pretty easily. I love these sneakers but I’m very disappointed in how long they held up."
UA,3,"It isn’t supportive in the arch at all.  Many comments indicated that it was.  Though it is cushioned, I can tell that my feet are starting to burn and I have only had them on for less than 15 minutes.  Can’t decide whether or not to keep them and put an insert in them."
UA,3,"It seems to fit as it should,  however , my first use was a 3 mile walk ( I made sure I wore sport socks) and I ended up with sores on the back of heal/ankle area. Not sure why that happened. I’m debating whether to keep them."
UA,3,"It's a good running shoes but the material is hard, i can not put it every because it gives pain on my toes."
UA,3,It's beautiful and true to size. It's not made for standing long hours.
UA,3,"Mine came with a defect on the toe part, the leather area of the toes looked peeled;  after wearing for 2 hours the heel part of the shoe gave me blisters, bad design."
UA,3,"My shoes were not the same color scheme as depicted in the picture I chose for order. Mine were supposed to be black with the white sole and white UA emblem. Instead my shoes are 100% black, so please be warned. They do fit a little bit more snug than other UA shoes that I own also by about half a size."
UA,3,Not enough support. Caused a lot of knee pain. Returned
UA,3,Not the color I ordered but the shoe was comfortable. I would definitely order again if they can get the color right.
UA,3,"Ok, I honestly don't know how these can be comfortable for running. But, running shoes are such a personal purchase because everyone's feet and running style are different. I bought a half size up to make room for my superfeet which wasn't necessary. My normal running shoe size fits as expected though without the superfeet. I ended up getting these somewhere else after returning these so that I could test them out and return if needed. I could barely last 20 mins walking in these so I didn't even attempt running in them. They're cute and comfy for everyday wear though and are a good shoe to run errands and stuff in. They offer good support for when you need to be on your feet for a while or for regular exercise like weight training."
UA,3,"Ordene esto para mi esposa pero
Me enviaron el color equivocado igual le gusto pero presten atención a la orden , el calzado es bueno el precio está bien y la entrega fue rápida pero no es el color que elegí y eso les resta
Puntos , espero que el vendedor responsable vea esto"
UA,3,"Ordered this shoe because it’s wide width, it is great & very comfortable. The 3 stars is because I’m bummed I’ve had them just 2 months & the inside of the inner left heel fabric is shredding."
UA,3,"Really love Under Armor shoes, but, I haves long big toe and the toe on this shoe was too short. I had to return them."
UA,3,"Recieved the wrong color, pretty disappointed in the misrepresentation. Otherwise the show fits well, maybe a tad on the small side. It feels like it has great support."
UA,3,Runs small n tight even though  I ordered  size 8 which is what I wear
UA,3,"Runs small, started to hurt after over an hour of walking"
UA,3,Seems to run smaller than normal.  Had to send them back only to find out they were out of stock.
UA,3,Shoe is stiff and not enough padding.
UA,3,Sizes aren’t true. Need to go up a size
UA,3,So far so good . My ankle very sensitive just now trying them
UA,3,Son muy cómodos pero ya se me despegaron
UA,3,"The first few months I was OK with these, but then the warm weather arrived and apparently my feet swelled a little.  These shoes seem to run NARROW.  There is not enough width in them.  I normally wear a 9, ordered a 9.5 in these because I always have to go half a size up in tennis shoes.  STILL too narrow and a bit too snug in general.

My return window's closed so no luck for me but - you will want to order a FULL WHOLE SIZE up from your normal shoe size."
UA,3,The fit around my ankle was off. Maybe too low? The sneakers felt a little bulky yet not supportive around my ankle. Sneakers work in a pinch.
UA,3,The picture showed black white and turquoise blue but they are actually only black and white. Picture is very misleading.
UA,3,"The shoes fit as expected, look great and comfortable left shoe.
The right shoe rubs on my ankle bone and has caused red irritated skin."
UA,3,"The shoes look really nice, but they were heavy and hard. I was expecting a more cushioned or softer material."
UA,3,The sneakers are soooo comfortable BUT the pictures so black and blue or black and pink yet the wording says black/white. I wanted black and blue and received black and white. VERY MISLEADING AND IM DISAPPOINTED
UA,3,The sneakers are very sturdy and hard.
UA,3,"These are great shoes but too small and narrow, I returned and order half size bigger and wide.. I use them for golf.."
UA,3,"These are really comfortable shoes for those that set or do little walking. I have been wearing them for over two weeks and really loved them BUT the part behind the forefoot right behind the toes under the foot becomes very painful. I do a lot of standing and walking, I know you have to break them in but I have been wearing them for over two weeks for 14 hours a day, I wouldn’t think it should still be so painful. If I take my heel out and wear them there is no pain. If I am working setting down there is no pain. For that reason I am giving them three stars.

I really like the shoes and if I had a set down job they would be idea for me."
UA,3,These seem like very good shoes.  My daughter loved them until one of the shoe lace holders broke.  She did not wear but for very good occasions. I have to figure out how to fix the shoes. They are comfortable.
UA,3,These shoes drive me bonkers!! I keep getting blisters if I wear ankle socks and the shoes are squeaky. I have had them for a few months and they still won't stop squeaking when I walk.
UA,3,These shoes gave me a blister and feel clunky.
UA,3,"These shoes looked very nice however, they were too short. My toe came all the way to the end of the shoe. I knew I could not wear them so unfortunately I had to return them."
UA,3,"They feel very stiff, and the fit is about a half size to whole size too small. They are very attractive, but I wish they were more comfortable."
UA,3,They fit ok. I do like that they came in wide. The shoe lace has a pulled string on it like they were shipped to someone else and returned then shipped to me.
UA,3,They look cool but no support. I actually got shin splints at the airport as a result! Wear them to go out to eat or something not to workout or even a long shopping spree.
UA,3,They look good of my feet but the shoe feels stiff for a running shoe even after I have worn them several times.
UA,3,"This is a nice looking shoe, but it lacks the support and cushioning that one would expect in a running shoe."
UA,3,"This shoe is NOT the same as it looks in the picture, colors are totally off."
UA,3,"This shoe is running almost a full size too small. I already returned a pair and really considering returning the second. Besides the size, the comfort seems ok. I'm not sure about working out yet because the shoe still fits a bit tight"
UA,3,Tight fit. Not tue best for veing on your feet all day.
UA,3,Too small
UA,3,"Too tight, Too stiff, not comfortable at all"
UA,3,"True to size and nice looking, but narrow toe box and thin, insufficient insole cushioning. Toes and forefoot were uncomfortable very quickly into workout. Returned."
UA,3,Usually wear a six but too small
UA,3,Walking in these shoes were better for me than running in them
UA,3,Walking outdoors is fine but don’t recommend when grass is wet- shoes soaked completely through to my socks real quick
UA,3,"Well, I do like them But unfortunately I didn’t receive what I ordered. So that was a little disappointing but they are comfortable."
UA,3,Would give better review.  But they squeak when I walk on concrete.  10hrs a day. They get on my nerves . Should have bough better pair.
Adidas,2,A very sharp looking shoe and the fit is perfect. My problem with it is that I need a shoe with a removable insole so that I can replace it with an orthodic insole. The memory foam is very uncomfortable for my foot which I didn't realize until I wore them outside.
Adidas,2,"Absolutely no support. They are cute and fine for around town and errand running, but I do not recommend for recreational running, walking or for people who are on their feet all day. I work at a hospital and I am on my feet all day. My entire body hurt after one day of use. I had to go to a DSW after work to buy new shoes because I wasn’t going to make it another day in these shoes at work."
Adidas,2,"As another review informed me (I should've listened!), although these shoes are pretty comfortable just walking around, they don't provide enough support while running. After about 30 minutes on the treadmill, my feet were aching! Definitely stay away if you're looking for any type of workout shoes."
Adidas,2,"bought for a long distance ""walking shoe"" - not a good idea. I have a very high arch and bone spurs on both heels - had to take shoes off after 1st day of 4 day walking trip and wear another pair of shoes in order to keep walking. As an around town shoe it is fine but for any distance - not good."
Adidas,2,"Bought these for my daughter who is in a women's size 5.  Couldn't even slide her foot in past her toes.  Order at least a full size if not a size and a half bigger than normal.  Also, material seems cheap but could be to market as a ""light weight""  shoe.  Who knows, but I am returning."
Adidas,2,Buy a size smaller! Uncomfortable and flat.
Adidas,2,"Came dirty and stained, as if they were used before. Gross."
Adidas,2,Cheap fabric makes your feet sweaty
Adidas,2,"Cheap materials
Fits below ankle"
Adidas,2,Cute but no proper cushioning with soft insole
Adidas,2,CUTE LOOK BUT DEFINITELY NOT A RUNNING SHOE. I PURCHASED THESE SNEAKERS APPROXIMATELY 6 WEEKS AGO.  I RUN AN AVERAGE OF 5 DAYS/20 MILES A WEEK.  THE SOLES OF THE SHOES ARE WORN THROUGH.
Adidas,2,Cute shoe but it has zero support! I have a high arch and this shoe is completely flat and offers no support for real workouts.
Adidas,2,"Definitely too big, size down half to one whole size. Comfortable but not supportive. A good lightweight tennis shoe for running errands, that’s about it."
Adidas,2,Didn’t like how they fit. Too small at the top I could barely get my foot in but the shoe was the perfect size
Adidas,2,Didnt like how the shoes look s diffrent  in different  shape one shoe look different one had different shape
Adidas,2,Do they still make real sneakers? These are light weight and good enough for errands but I wouldn’t do sports in them. They discolor quickly too.
Adidas,2,Everyone said to order half a size smaller because they run big.. they were to tight and small.  Very disappointed. Also when I went half a size smaller they cost more!
Adidas,2,Fit super weird. Tried these shoes on at the store and loved them. When they came in the mail they didn’t fit right. Returned. Not a fan
Adidas,2,"Got these as running shoes. They are comfortable, light and look good. However, I ran 1.5 miles on them and got bad blisters in both feet. Unacceptable based on the description of the product."
Adidas,2,Great shoes for gym or running errands.  Easy to throw then in washer & easy to get clean.
Adidas,2,Had this product for less than a month and it’s already falling apart. Idk if adidas is not as good of a company for shoes as I thought or if they are knock offs but I hoped they would last at least a year. They’re cute but not worth the price for this.
Adidas,2,Had to return because the back of the shoe was digging into my Achilles and had no flexibility. Shoe was very light and cool looking but didn’t fit functionally at least on my feet.
Adidas,2,"Hard to get on, and get dirty way too easily. Comfortable enough though"
Adidas,2,Hmmm insole was too small for left side of shoe. My foot was stepping on the edge of the insole and made it extremely uncomfortable... looks great but disappointed...
Adidas,2,"Honestly l feel cracking in @ least 1 shoe as the back heel support. The entry of your FOOT...mine exceptionally small found to be extremely hard to get my teeny ankle & foot into. I truly am disappointed. Thiugh my husb had a quadruple bypass prior mo we both were not real well.  Ot jiwing l now have since his recent 6day ICZU stay for both me w/him.

Adidas,2,"I agree with some of reviews. The quality of this shoe isn’t good,  can’t wear for a long time. The sole is not durable and too soft, so I return it"
Adidas,2,"I am so disappointed. I thought the name of these shoes immediately screamed comfort and after trying them on, they are just your average shoe. No support. No cushioned insole. False advertising. Sending them back."
Adidas,2,I bought as I work in the medical field and everyone recommended them. They did not support my comfort my feet like I anticipated they would. I give it a 2/5!
Adidas,2,"I bought these as school shoes for both of my girls (12 years, 14 years) and they've worn them for exactly 1 month and the material has already ripped from the soles/has holes. Disappointed because they LOVED these shoes."
Adidas,2,"I bought these for working out and everyday shoes. They fit perfect and are very comfortable, but they are pretty flimsy on the top. My right shoe developed a hole within a week. By the end of the month, the shoe was unusable. Also, the grey mesh gets dirty quick. I walked on some blacktops and grassy areas, and each time the colors rubbed off on the shoe.

SO - if you just want these for walking around the house/indoors and looking cute, then yes, buy them. But don't use them for vigorous activity! Or much of any activity really."
Adidas,2,"I bought these to replace what I thought was going to be the same model of Adidas Cloudfoam shoes I bought last year at Nordstrom Rack. When these arrived I noticed they looked a bit off.

The shoes appear to be different sizes and made funky. The tag inside both shoes is size 7.5, but the right side is definitely shorter than it’s mate. Also, the left heel has a strange lift at the back where the right does not, and the white foam border isn’t even all the way around and is especially noticeable from the heel.

Bottom line, this intended replacement pair does not fit like they should, so I’ll be returning."
Adidas,2,"I did not care for these, not sure they are real Adidas. My daughter and I compared mine and hers, and the cloud feel is different. Also the top of this show puckered. It looks weird so I am returning. I thought when I purchased through Amazon that I would be able to return at Kohl's just like other purchases. Wrong - I have to pay to ship them back and then wait for the refund. Not real happy about this. I guess I missed the fine print somewhere!"
Adidas,2,"I didnt realize when I ordered these that they are SLIP ON shoes. There is no ""tongue"" and the laces are pretty much for decoration. The foot opening is SO small. If you have a high instep or high arches, dont even consider these for a second. You'll need a shoehorn and a lot of elbow grease. I felt like Cinderella's stepsister, trying to jam my foot into a tiny shoe. Except the shoe isnt tiny...I bought my typical size 8 and received what is labeled as an 8, but the shoe is several inches longer than my foot. Not sure how everyone is raving about this shoe...how are you even getting it on your foot?"
Adidas,2,"I don’t know how this shoe is marketed as a running shoe. For a true runner, this shoe has ZERO support. I even just went for a 30 min walk today and they were not supportive enough and killed my feet by the end of the walk. Cute for running errands or to round out an athletic outfit but NOT good for doing actual athletics."
Adidas,2,I don’t know how to rate this yet as far as comfort but FYI runs large like a whole size! I am always a 9.5 but even size 10. Which I ordered a 10 way to big exchanged for a 9.5 and still to big. So now I am trying a 9
Adidas,2,"I don’t love these.  They are definitely not for working out.  The heel is too wide for my foot but the length fits perfect, so I wouldn’t really be able to go a size down for a better fit in the heel.  They aren’t the most comfortable.  I like a good, sturdy sneaker and these just don’t fit the bill."
Adidas,2,"I ended up returning this shoe. I felt like the opening of the shoe was too wide, gaping and did not look snug around the top of my foot. The laces don’t come all the way back to functionally hold your foot bed in place. The shoe looked nice but could never be an actual work out shoe."
Adidas,2,I got lots of compliments when wearing the shoes. They are very cute and feel comfortable when you first put them on. Definitely cannot be worn when walking a lot due to having virtually no support. Actually started to get pain in my feet while walking just average distances around work or my neighborhood.
Adidas,2,"I got the shoes two days ago and walked around the neighborhood, mostly sidewalks, and the bottom of one the sneakers already feels flatten, like the sole is already worn."
Adidas,2,"I got these shoes mid September and I am having to replace them mid October. I bought these shoes because they are advertised as a running shoe. I run/ walk 3-4 miles a day pushing a double stroller. After only a month the bottoms of the shoes are worn down so much that my feet slip around when I walk after a rain (not very safe when pushing a stroller). I expected more from adidas shoes.

For what it is worth, if you only want these shoes to wear casually, they fit well and were comfortable. Just don’t expect to use them for exercise."
Adidas,2,"I had to return these shoes. They offer very little support while running. After a short three mile run my legs and feet were in a world of pain. I gave them  another shot a few days later and exact same outcome.

I have another pair of Cloudfoam and they were more expensive. It’s obvious comparing the two visually and after running that these are much more stripped down version."
Adidas,2,"I have been wearing the Adidas cloud form for about 2 years. I've never had an issue, although I always purchased at a local shoe store. It was time for a new pair, so I decided ordering online. I won't be doing that again. The shoes I received are much more narrow than the same exact shoes and size as I've purchased at a shoe store in the past. The left shoe seems more defected than the right as the sole of it extends way out to the right. Adidas makes a comfortable shoe, and the cloud forms are no exception, but I strongly suggest going to a shoe store. The ones I ordered online even came in a different box than what I've always gotten at the shoe store. Makes me wonder if these aren't some kind of knock off or perhaps they are true Adidas, but rejects from the factory. I dunno. I'll be looking for a different shoe due to this experience."
Adidas,2,"I have owned many Adidas, but this pair was unlike the others.  There was not much support, the shoe was narrow and stiff on the top of my feet.  The sole just didn’t look like any of my other Adidas.  I returned this pair right away."
Adidas,2,"I have the same style and brand but in black, and I bought this grey color as a replacement. Somehow it fits differently and I have blisters on the top of my foot from the sneaker’s “tongue” (the material that sticks up at the top).  It is such a bummer because overall, the sneaker is very comfortable for outdoor exercise."
Adidas,2,"I have worn New balance, Nike, and Brooks in the past.  These have little to no support.  Cute but not supportive enough for me."
Adidas,2,"I just recieved the teal color and they are way too wide (but really cute). I expected them to be M width, as stated when purchased. However, on the tag and box it says 5 D 61/2. I'm assuming the D may be the width....just my assumption. I called the Adidas help line listed and was told to purchase a 1/2 size smaller and it will be narrower...???!!!"
Adidas,2,"I like the shoes overall, however the adidas emblem came coming off... disappointed for the shoes being brand new"
Adidas,2,"I like these shoes for work, i also have the white they are super cute and comfy. However my package came destroyed. There was a plastic bag around the shoe box undamaged, but the box inside was ripped up A LOT. The whole side panel ripped off and just thrown in the bag, the top of the box had a huge hole ripped in it. the shoes were not damaged but this is very irritating. just the point that i paid money for a nice new pair of shoes, and it comes in a ripped up box is unflattering and annoying in my opinion."
Adidas,2,I like these. Visually they're nice and not bulky. Size I think is about right. The one thing I can't take is the tongue of the shoe is so stiff and it's attached to the upper so you can't move it like a typical shoe tongue.  It cuts into my shin/ankle and I can't take it. I even wore high socks which looked bad. I would not run in these but for day to day errands they would work if the tongue wasn't so stiff.
Adidas,2,I love the look and comfort of this shoe! However I only had the shoe 13 days (not worn everyday) and the side has come apart from the rubber. Very unsatisfied.
Adidas,2,"I love the style of these shoes but when I received them, each shoe was shaped/sized differently. The tags say they are both a size 10, but there is clearly some discrepancy in the sizing/design."
Adidas,2,"I love the style of these shoes but when I received them, each shoe was shaped/sized differently. The tags say they are both a size 10, but there is clearly some discrepancy in the sizing/design."
Adidas,2,"I love the way these shoes look - but i've been wearing these for SIX WEEKS - and not even every day - and there is already a hole in the bottom of one of them. The soles are made of foam but you'd think they'd be a *little* more durable than that. Very disappointed, even at $50, and kind of wondering if these are counterfeit due to the horrific quality. Guess it's time to switch to Nike!"
Adidas,2,"I love these shoes and have bought multiple
pairs. I picked up this black pair for outdoor walking shoes and weirdly the entire tread wore out in three months. I have never worn out the tread of a sneaker in my entire life so I think that pair might have been defective. I am buying them again because they are one of the only shoes I can wear comfortably, but you might want to limit these shoes to indoor use only."
Adidas,2,I loved the color of these shoes and how much cushion there was. But I had to return them because they were entirely too narrow and the end of the shoes. I am so disappointed that they were like this.
Adidas,2,"I loved these shoes at first. They’re super comfortable, lightweight, and have a nice fit. They don’t, however, last long. Within 6 weeks there were holes in the foot soles. I walk about 20 miles a week and these just couldn’t hold up."
Adidas,2,"I loved these shoes when I got them. They are true to size and very comfortable. I walk about 15 miles a week (taking my son to and from school), and my feet don’t hurt at all when wearing them. However, I’ve only had these shoes for a month, and the soles are almost completely worn at the ball of my foot. I am not doing any strenuous running or climbing with them, and I only walk on paved roads. I feel like they will be completely unwearable in the next few weeks. So I payed $50 for 6 weeks of wear..."

Adidas,2,"I loved these shoes, I got compliments on them (the white ones) and they were comfortable. They were not for working out, but walking in them was great until the tread on the bottom completely wore off within 2 months time. I didn't walk in them a lot and didn't even notice until I made a trip to zoo wearing them and I wanted to cut my feet off by the time I left because there was no support left under the ball of my foot. They still look great on the parts you can see, but they no longer offer any comfort or support. Its disappointing to have shoes that don't even last 3 months."
Adidas,2,"I ordered these for my wife. The first pair was an 8.5 and they were just a little too small so we sent back and ordered a half size bigger, 9. She got the shoes and they are huge. The half size larger was more like 1.5 bigger.. She really likes the shoes but now we don't know if we should retry to order a 9 or try the 8.5 again.."
Adidas,2,"I ordered these shoes in my usual size 10, but they were much too wide and long.  These are a twisted ankle waiting to happen.  The fit is sloppy and my feet slid around inside the shoe so much that my toes would be pushed all the way forward, even past the foot bed.  There was not a way to tighten the laces so this wouldn’t happen.  I returned the shoes."
Adidas,2,I ordered these to go walking in but they are no support.  They are not comfortable at all.  Will not be ordering again.
Adidas,2,"I really liked these shoes. They are very comfortable however, I bought a pair for my husband and I and after wearing them for a bit our feet slowly started smelling at the end of our day... always wear clean socks, always clean feet... I can't even wear them anymore because they make my feet smell...."
Adidas,2,"I really wanted to love these shoes.  I run about 3 miles a day, and the first couple of runs I felt like I was running on air.  Then I realized that these are way too big, and I was started to get blisters on my toes.  I normally order an 8 in running shoes, but I could have gotten by with a 7.5 or even a 7 in these.  They also don't have much cushion after you've run over 50 miles in them.  I may go back to just buying Nike."
Adidas,2,"I received my package not in it’s original packaging stating that the original box was damaged, which would have been fine, but the bottoms looks like someone wore them then put them back. I expected to receive new sneakers not “new to me” sneakers!"
Adidas,2,"I sort of wonder if these weren't the real things as well.  The left one looked okay, the right shoe was sewn onto the sole badly which made the shoe look longer from toe to ties.  They make nice slippers/quick shopping shoes, wouldn't wear them exercising at all.  Sad, because the picture makes them look much nicer - Not sure still if these were real or fake."
Adidas,2,I took them for a 2 mile walk. I was dying from my feet coming back. No support and definitely not good for long walks.
Adidas,2,"I tried this same brand and style in the store, and what I received was not the same shoe. It felt completely different. I was so disappointed, and had high hopes that they would be the same as the adidas I tried on in a major department store."
Adidas,2,I wanted to like these. I was looking for a lightweight shoe. The problem is that there basically is no sole to the shoe. The foam is very thin. If you get them be prepared to buy inserts or don’t plan on wearing them very long. They are definitely cute...but going back.
Adidas,2,"I wanted to love these shoes so much... I bought them based on the 20k plus reviews on the amazing “adidas” shoes... the fit was a bit tight. I usually wear size 8, and I had ordered 8.5. I am a nurse working on a busy hospital medical floor, and I am on a search to find the best shoes that won’t hurt my feet or lower back from running for 13+ hours. I wore these shoes today for one shift (14 hours total). I came home to find swollen bilateral anterior parts of my ankles. Some reviews had mentioned this flaw. The top lip of the adidas shoe is abnormally longer than a normal shoe, therefore if your foot is different, it’ll make you hurt and swollen. Be cautious of buying... I’m returning them right away unfortunately."
Adidas,2,"I wanted to love these shoes.  So many influencers have them on IG and they're adorable with many nice features; however! if I had to rate for comfort my Nike's versus these, my Nike's a 9.5 and these a 3 at best.  I have size 8 in Nike's. I tried the 8s in these, sent back for 7.5 and again sent back for a 7.  I've worn them to walk once for a half hour and they hurt my arches a bit.  I wore today for the second time and the Adidas lines on the side of one shoe are already peeling off.  Junk."
Adidas,2,I was disappointed in this shoe the first walk I took I could feel everything on the road I do not recommend this shoe.
Adidas,2,"I was really excited about these shoes, but have owned them a month and my excitement is gone. I use them for walking, and they are already worn out, the cushioning is squished and the tread is all but gone. Really disappointed. They are very comfortable, but aren't great if you plan to wear them regularly."
Adidas,2,"I was really excited to get these shoes. I have the exact same model in another color that I bought from the store  and wanted to expand my collection to match my work out gear. These shoes, however, did not fit the same as my other pair AT ALL. I compared and the stitching seems off causing the stretch of the material to not be as forgiving. I couldn't get my feet into the shoes since the opening was so tight. I finally got them in and they fit tight. I wore them around and got them to stretch enough to work out but I will not be purchasing from an online store again. I think these are the shoes that don't make the quality inspection and are sent to be sold here. They aren't even cheaper than they would be in a store retailer so I say save your money and buy them in person if you can."
Adidas,2,I was unable to put the shoe on without crunching down the heel portion.  Thought  they were a typical lace up shoe with the ability to loosen the laces - not so.  The appearance is nice and they were lightweight but since I couldn’t wear  them I can’t speak to any of its other possible attributes.  I donated them rather than return them.
Adidas,2,"I was underwhelmed when I got these.  Quality was lacking, it doesn't seem like it would hold up well.  Returned it.  It was lightweight though, which was what I wanted, but that's not enough for me to keep."
Adidas,2,"I was wanting extra length for comfortable running, but the were too loose and couldn’t really be tightened."
Adidas,2,I wear a size 6 so that is what I ordered and I couldn't even get half my foot in the shoe. They were way too tight.
Adidas,2,I wore them 1 day and my feet stink! I never have stinky feet! The stupid tab that helps you pull on the shoe catches your pants. So every time you sit and then stand you have to fix your pants.
Adidas,2,I’m a nurse who suffer from bunions and these are actually COMFORTABLE! I’ve tried so many different kind of shoes but I finally found something I can wear for my 12 he shifts! I was looking into getting h ultra boost by those run $180. These were only$40! Way better dra!
Adidas,2,I’ve bought cloudfoam before and these tennis shoes aren’t the same comfort. This shoes feel like your walking on concrete. Very disappointed.
Adidas,2,I’ve bought two pairs of these cloud foam in the past and I order half a size up which is a size 10 and they are great and usually fit perfectly. These are so tight I thought I ordered the wrong size! Super disappointed! Super snug and I ordered half a size up!
Adidas,2,"If I could put 0 stars for workout and support, I would. These are purely for looks not for exercise. 5 star for looks but fashion is all these should ever be for."
Adidas,2,"I'm normally a 7.5 but ordered a 7 after reading reviews, but the 7 is still too large. I would recommend ordering an entire size down. Also the picture for the blue tint / white looks much more white online, but in person is more of a sea foam green color and not what I was expecting. They seem cute to walk in but I don't think I'll be able to run in these as there's almost no support in the front of the shoe."
Adidas,2,It feels really hard for being cloud foam. The person I bough these for  is on her feet all day and says they aren't comfortable. I will not buy these shoes again. Also for being prime they took a while for me to get them. I usually love adidas but save your money.
Adidas,2,"It is better to check with the stores. I didn't find this shoe comfortable and great as my previous adidas shoes. I like the brand so much, so ordered it. Also the size I received was way too large. Not worth the money."
Adidas,2,It is comfortable but it's definitely not for training. When I was pushing a loaded sled my shoes kept coming off and it made my workout more difficult.
Adidas,2,"I've always have Adidas, but this one is too narrow and it gave me a major blister on the right side below the big toe.  Not sure if it's defective, but there's a rough patch in the right side.  I only used it once."
Adidas,2,"Just received my sneakers today and was disappointed that they look like two different shoes. The material is not the same and actually the left on doesn’t fit like the right one. But they are super comfortable, just wish they were the same shoe"
Adidas,2,"Looks nice, but did not hold up well. These sneakers are great for short walks. I wore them to Disney and these did not hold up at all. I was really disappointed in how the cushioning wasn't able to withstand the day. I'm going to stick to my asics and sketchers for Disney."
Adidas,2,"los mas comodos que he tenido , mi hija lpos probo y ya me los quito, tendre que comprar otros jajaja"
Adidas,2,"Love the shoes and would love another pair...but not if they don’t hold up like these! I’ve worn these maybe 5 times and the side “stripes” are coming off one shoe! Overall love the shoe, but wish this wasn’t happening!"
Adidas,2,Loved the look of these and the initial feeling of the cloud foam souls. HATE thesis my feet feel after going for a walk. The balls of my feet are so tender and have blisters forming. So disappointing.
Adidas,2,"Loved the looks of the shoe, but they’re extremely hard to get on. The tongue of the shoe is totally attached with no separation. Very light weight. Not sure it would be considered a substantial running shoe, but if you’re looking for just an everyday shoe and you don’t mind the struggle of getting your shoes on they would be fine. I returned mine."
Adidas,2,"Material feels light and cheap, edges are tough which hurts and causes blister after walking a while, sole is thin"
Adidas,2,"My feet may be a touch wide due to buttons but these were the most uncomfortable shoes.  The “support” or lack of was inadequate and the tongue part just rubbed on my shin.  After walking a mile on the treadmill, I had blisters on my feet, could barely walk, and an open wound to my skin on the front part of my calf from where it just rubbed constantly.  I’m really grateful that they accepted the return."
Adidas,2,My wife originally loved these shoes. She’s been wearing them for about to months just running normal errands nothing excessive. Now both shoes have holes in the bottom. The shoes do not hold up to normal wear and tear for to long.
Adidas,2,"Nice shoe, but too narrow (for my ""Fred Flinstone"" feet anyway 😂)."
Adidas,2,No padding or arch support!
Adidas,2,No padding to speak of in the sole  of the shoe. Not sure how someone could work on their feet all day wearing These.
Adidas,2,No support
Adidas,2,No support. Too flimsy. I sent them back.
Adidas,2,Not enough support.
Adidas,2,Not much comfort foam. I had to add my memory foam inserts from an old pair of Skechers.
Adidas,2,not sure if these are authentic or not but I did have the same pair I bought from the Adidas store and it came with a yellow tag with the word cloudfoam.. this one I bought off amazon did not.
Adidas,2,Not very durable! Cheaply made.
Adidas,2,"Order 1 to 2 sizes up, way to small"
Adidas,2,Order a size to 1/2 size smaller than normal for the best fit.
Adidas,2,"ORIGINAL REVIEW (4 stars) Very soft and comfortable sneakers. I ordered an 11 and found that they are slightly too narrow for my feet, but the sneakers are so soft and stretchy that I can wear them comfortably despite this issue. I like the light pink color, it looks better in person.

UPDATE: After two days of wearing them, these shoes look horrible. The fabric stains very easily and the shoes are becoming uncomfortable from lack of support. I wish I hadn't bought them, despite the low $20 price tag."
Adidas,2,Picture makes it look like one of those lace less shoes but it’s not. They just look weird on the foot and ain’t supper supportive
Adidas,2,"Pros- Super cute and stylish if you’re only wearing for fashion purposes

Cons- these were delivered March 25. Today is April 29. These shoes are COMPLETELY worn on the bottom. There is absolutely no tread left on the bottom of the shoe, under the ball of the foot. I mostly used them for walking/ jogging and I’m a beginner so typically it was only for a mile or two at a time. For an Adidas shoes to last less than a month is totally unacceptable. I have no idea where these positive reviews are coming from. My knees suddenly started to hurt (I’ve never had this issue before) and I 100% attribute it to these. Look elsewhere."
Adidas,2,Received my shoes today and tho the fit great and they look nice they had obviously been worn before. None of the paper packing was in the box or inside the shoe and the souls of the shoes where dirty.
Adidas,2,Returned these. I have other cloud foam sneakers that are super comfortable but these seemed to have a thinner layer of foam so they weren’t as comfortable. The insole also didn’t fill the bottom of the sneakers so I could feel where it ended as a walked.
Adidas,2,Rubbed on side of foot and created a sore. I bought these for jogging purposes and at first they were comfortable and then I noticed they rubbed and rubbed on the inside of my right foot until they eventually created a sore that bled. They are definetly cute but I returned them and bought different sneakers at goodwill for $20 that work fine. Wouldn't reccomend for running.
Adidas,2,"Runs a little bit big. Disappointed in this shoe, relatively no support. Very cute look and design, great price, but you pay for what you get."
Adidas,2,Shoes had scuff marks on fabric and rubber. Ended up returning.
Adidas,2,Shoes look good. Not comfortable
Adidas,2,"Sizing is off some what, toe box very large."
Adidas,2,"So disappointed in these! I wanted WHITE shoes, ended up with blue....shoe lace holes have red underneath- so strange. Comfy, but will be returning."
Adidas,2,So disappointed!  I have probably worn these 30 times and they are completely worn through on the bottom!
Adidas,2,"So I am 5.10 / 184 pounds, also I walk about 5-15K steps a day almost every day. This pair of shoes lasted 3 months! After that I got holes on the soles of them, unwearable! Wouldn't recommend for bigger ppl who walk quite a bit. However they are comfortable, light weight, and cute. You just gonna need 4 pairs per year."
Adidas,2,Strange laces and uncomfortable
Adidas,2,"Super comfortable, loved running in them but just after 4 months the insides of the shoes started to tear along the seams."
Adidas,2,Super cute but not for exercise. Went on a couple light jogs and my knees were killiiiing me the next day. The only change was the shoes!
Adidas,2,"Super cute but way to tight, I wear a size 6 and have skinny small feet and I couldn’t get these on. Super disappointed."
Adidas,2,"Super cute, not comfy. My feet ache after wearing these and I’m just doing basic walking...not serious workouts."
Adidas,2,The insole is a half inch smaller than the shoe. I think they must have been trying to save money.
Adidas,2,"The item doesn’t come in a 10.5. So I ordered the 11 after reading reviews. It’s way too big. I try to exchange it for the 10, but the size 10 is twice the price. No thank you. I don’t like playing pricing games."
Adidas,2,The right shoe has a defective sole it sticks out on inner sole looks as if it’s molded wrong! Please send me return info! Thank you
Adidas,2,"The shoe is cute, but it has absolutely no arch support and almost no padding in the sole. I put them on and walked around the house for a while, and it was almost like walking barefoot. In my opinion, they should not be advertised as a ""running shoe"" or an ""exercise shoe."" I gave them two stars because they are a cute fashion sneaker and would be comfortable enough to wear while driving around town to run errands but not for walking any great distances. I am returning them."
Adidas,2,"The shoe is very narrow. Even though it has shoe laces they do little more than decorate. If you want the shoe to have more room, loosening the laces will have no affect on it."
Adidas,2,The shoes are comfortable once on. If you have wide feet this shoes will not work for you. I have very narrow (thin) feet and I have a hard time putting this shoes on. I would not buy another pair like these.
Adidas,2,The shoes are comfortable to wear with shorts but not to walk long distance in. I wore these shoes on a gravel path and I swear you could feel all the rocks dig into your feet. The sole is not thick.
Adidas,2,"The shoes are made way to wide, and the material is so flimsy that it gives the shoes no structure, hence no support. The shoes could perhaps pass for causal shoes for outfits, but definitely not supportive enough for exercising or even just long walk"
Adidas,2,The shoes are very comfortable but they are extremely wide and the fabric stretched out significantly. They stretched out within hours of wearing them and now the fabric is loose. When trying the laces to make them fit the fabric bunches up. I would go down a half to one full size for a good fit.
Adidas,2,"The shoes feel very cheap, they don’t have good back support and they are not good to wear for long periods of time."
Adidas,2,"The shoes look very nice, but they are wide and do not have enough comfort for the toes. They are not running shoes."
Adidas,2,The size of the shoe was correct but the laces could not be tightened around the foot.  This made the shoe slip around the top and sides of the foot which was incredibly uncomfortable.  This shoe is not good for running but if you just wanted to wear it for short walks it may Work for that.
Adidas,2,"The sneaker looked cute, but doesn’t look well made. I wear a size 9 and it was at least a half size too big. Just looked cheaply made."
Adidas,2,The tongue of the shoe is to long - therefore it pushes into my ankle - definitely not for running and not a great amount of support
Adidas,2,The two shoes did not look quite the same. The white lip on one shoe didn’t come up as far as the other in the front and sides. It was too noticeable to me. Maybe it’s a factory defect.  It is a shame because they are cute and comfortable.
Adidas,2,"There are certainly stylish, but not functional for working out / running. The inner liner is very thin, and the whole shoe doesn’t seem like it will last long. These are cute though if all you’re looking for is a lightweight shoe to run errands in or wear to the airport.

I bought these because they were marketed as running shoes and I planned to use them for walking and light exercising too. However, based on the lack of support and lack of overall quality / feel of the shoe - I will be returning."
Adidas,2,There is almost no coushion in these shoes and they are very narrow. I have narrow feet and they are still small.
Adidas,2,"There is memory foam in one, and not the other. Unfortunately I did not try them prior to the day I needed them to walk around a theme park. So it was a long, uncomfortable day."
Adidas,2,"There is no support for overpronation, shoe fit like a sock. The tongue was too long and dug into my ankle as I walked. At the end of my 12hr shift, my feet were on fire."
Adidas,2,There’s a deep sewn seam about .5 inches from the top of the toe that your big toe will rub with every step you take. I think these came from an outlet adidas store. The quality is really bad.
Adidas,2,These are adorable fitting and comfortable at first but as you're wearing them and walking even just for daily activity you will find they become very uncomfortable and offer no support.  These are definitely not for exercise (not even walking)..... but they are cute with a pair of lululemon tights!! :)
Adidas,2,These are called running shoes but after less than a month the bottoms are so worn away that they’re ready for the trash.
Adidas,2,"These are comfortable when you put them on at first. It’s like there is no “breaking in” of the shoe, but they don’t seem as supportive as the other brand of shoes I usually wear. I feel like I’m lacking in arch support and my back hurts me after I wear these. I’m not a small person but I’m not obese either."
Adidas,2,"These are cute and nice for errands, or going for a walk. Also very comfortable. I got them when they were on sale for $35. I think that’s what they should be priced at regularly because they are not running shoes. They’re not very high quality in general. After wearing to walk around in twice, the base of them already have wrinkles, making them look old."
Adidas,2,"These are cute but feel weird and cheap and plastic-y. They’re fine for the $40 I paid, but I would never pay $70 for them."
Adidas,2,These are not adjustable at the laces and are crazy difficult to slip on.
Adidas,2,"These are not supportive at all. These would not be good for any type of workout, my foot would slide right out."
Adidas,2,"These are really cute, but they give me the worst blisters on the arch of my foot if I jog more than a mile. These shoes are fine for walking around but would not recommend for running. Also they run about a half size big."
Adidas,2,"These didn’t even last me a year. I love the way they look on my feet, but they have never really been comfortable. My feet hurt after wearing them all day. They offer very little support. My advice: spend a little more money and get something that won’t hurt your feet and will last longer."
Adidas,2,These look really good but I suggest trying them on at the store before purchasing. They weren’t comfortable and fit weird.
Adidas,2,"These run big, I suggest at least a half size smaller than normal size"
Adidas,2,"These shoes are comfortable and fit well. I walk about 12-15 miles per week in them and have had them since July 2020, it is now April 2021 and the soles are completely worn off. The foam is not durable for walking and I CANNOT imagine it would last at any rate for running. If you are looking for a lifestyle shoe then they are great, if you actually want something for activity, with durability, do not pick this shoe."
Adidas,2,"These shoes are difficult to put on (very tight), then the toe is quite narrow, so uncomfortable.  Maybe the designers should study some cheap Chinese slip-on shoes for some ideas?"
Adidas,2,"These shoes are insanely comfortable but I wish they were made better. I have worn holes through the sole of these sneakers after only 4 months of daily dog walking. I had 2 other pairs... same thing happened. As comfy as they are, I will not be purchasing again... not worth the money when I can only wear for a few short months."
Adidas,2,"These shoes are larger than size and can't be tied very tightly due to the laces. Also, they don't offer much support. Very disappointed."
Adidas,2,These shoes are made very poorly and look cheaply made. I don't think they will last so I had to return.
Adidas,2,"These shoes are really hard to put on. The “tongue” is sewn into place and is not a separate part of the shoe like most sneakers: it doesn’t move. Once you get them on, they are fairly comfortable,  but not for very long. I wouldn’t wear them to go for a walk/hike in. They are fine as a fashion sneaker, but not comparable to most Adidas."
Adidas,2,"These shoes are really weird. Aesthetically I like the look a lot, but they have ZERO support and might as well be slippers. It’s very uncomfortable to walk in them. I def would not ever buy these again."
Adidas,2,"These shoes are so wide and loose, and I had already sized down based on other reviews. Even when you try to tighten them, the ankle part doesn’t tighten. I had to double check the box to make sure I didn’t accidentally order a wide, but I didn’t. I don’t recommend them if you have even a slightly narrow foot. I’ve never had this problem before. They are cute though! Wish they fit."
Adidas,2,"These shoes are the exact same size and style as previous pairs that I've purchased. However, they are NOT the same quality. The white edge of the sole that surrounds the toe is supposed to be significant and in the photo you can see it is hardly existent. It changes the entire look and feel of these shoes. I HATE doing returns so I will keep the shoes for that simple fact. They are just not the same and makes me question their authenticity."
Adidas,2,"These shoes are very light weight which is nice, however the foam sole goes flat after a few wears and offers no support. It’s a cute and affordable sneaker though I wouldn’t buy it for support."
Adidas,2,These shoes are very tight on the top of my foot. It fits like a painful glove. I don't have high arches so I was surprised how this shoe has no elasticity or give. Getting a size larger didn't help. It only led to a half inch of space near my toes.
Adidas,2,These shoes hurt my feet so bad. Ive never had heel pain like these inspired. It took a few weeks of not wearing them anymore to get back to normal. I do give an extra star just because they are really cute sneakers. I could understand pain anywhere else because I have wide feet and high arches but what on earth is wrong with these that they damaged the interior of my heel? I'm not talking about blisters. I'm talking bruised feeling. So weird. Never happened with any other shoes and pain is gone since I had some separation from these torture devices. But still. Really cute.
Adidas,2,"These shoes initially worked just fine for daily use (working as a teacher), but not even 6 months later, the glue and other odds and ends started falling apart. They really do seem to be a pair of Adidas that didn’t meet the quality standard, and now it makes sense why they were available for much less. They arrived May 5th, and I stopped being able to wear them regularly by October."
Adidas,2,"These sneakers came in a regular box with a note saying the original box was damaged, ok, well I didnt think the sneakers I paid 70$ for would be damaged also..the bottom soles are scuffed all the way around.It looks like they were drug across something. I am not happy with that at all. My bf said maybe its just the way the rubber is made but no, I just got a pair of all black adidas same exact brand 2 weeks ago at famous footwear and they still have no scuffs at all, and I paid less! Love the sneaker, fits great and comfortable. If they were cheaper I'd understand and accept it but I paid full price for theses shoes! Def returning!"
Adidas,2,These were not comfortable at all. The cushioning felt very thin and like it would wear out quickly.
Adidas,2,They are comfy.
Adidas,2,"They are quite different from the pair I bought in store. No arch support. Too ride. Love the color, but will be returning. Sorry."
Adidas,2,They are so loose my foot kept moving around in them.
Adidas,2,"They look nice, but after wearing them for only a week, I am beginning to have foot problems. Definitely not for working out, but even for my daily walking, they were not up to par."
Adidas,2,They looked good initially until I attempted to put them on. They are built for long and narrow feet. I went up a 1/2 size because I prefer to have sock room and in doing so there is a three finger width length difference and they are way tighter than my normal sized shoes would feel. I know shoes stretch over time but I need to be able to wear them for more than a minute to stretch them.
Adidas,2,"They were light weight and comfortable for walking around the house, but didn’t feel like they would have enough support to get me through a 5k, as I do every weekend. I don’t need house sneakers so I sent them back for something with more support."
Adidas,2,"They’re cute.  Just ok.  Probably will return.  They run big, and aren’t as “spongy” as I thought they’d be.  I don’t think they’d be comfortable for “road running”."
Adidas,2,This athletic shoe has no tongue! I have small average feet and could not get my foot into the shoe. Very strange.
Adidas,2,This is a cloud form shoe. Not good for work or working out. Comfortable for running errands and attractive.
Adidas,2,This is definitely a knock off! Beware when buying! The style is completely different fit from the one you would buy at a reputable retailer !
Adidas,2,This is the 3rd pair of these I bought for my wife. She absolutely loves them
Adidas,2,"This product runs larger than they say. I am a half size and they recommended that I go up a size and I am swimming in these shoes. These shoes are like a slipper. Do not anticipate wearing these for any athletic endeavor as there is no support. Every pebble is felt through the sole. After even a week of wearing, I can tell that they will not hold up. They look nice... DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A RUNNING SHOE."
Adidas,2,"This shoe is HARD on tender feet. I get no energy return from the sole of the shoe and the insole has very little cushion at all. I have poor circulation so the more ""lift"" I can get from a shoe, the better. These are lightweight, though slightly difficult to get on if you have high arches and a narrow instep."
Adidas,2,This shoe Is lightweight- and that’s the best I can say for it. The sole is very thin and the cushioning practically non-existent.  It will not hold up over time or with any serious use. I would say spend a little more money and get a better quality shoe. It seems flimsy straight from the box. Disappointed and returned immediately-
Adidas,2,"This shoe is not as it is in picture. I have a similar shoe in another brand which did not have laces to tie up.  I decided on this one as it looked very similar.  However the first thing I saw in the box were the long laces..  Also I usually wear an 8 but on  “tennis” type shoes but I got 8 1/2.  It is more like a 9.  I am sending them back.  Sad, as they are kind of cool but very thin as compared to my pair I paid $200 for."
Adidas,2,this shoe is really cute and I love the color but it is very difficult to slip on and the laces do not adjust. I do not have a narrow foot and this shoe is too narrow.  disappointing.
Adidas,2,"This was definitely bought for fashion initially, and the style of it I find truly adorable. However, I’m on my feet most of the time at work, and wearing these for only two months had worn out the cushion very quickly.
Not worth the amount if you are looking for something durable and long-lasting."
Adidas,2,"this was not a comfortable shoe, not soft insole or ""cloudfoam"".  I'll be returning"
Adidas,2,"Thought the ascent color would be more of a beige, it’s definitely gold.
Also, I’ve had 2 other pair of the cloud foam and usually wear a 7, but these fit extremely small for some reason?!"
Adidas,2,Too thin does feel real or authentic... I think the sole will run down sooner than it supposed to.
Adidas,2,trash
Adidas,2,"Two stars because I like the color. I have an older, similar model of this shoe and wanted another pair. I have been a size 10 since I was a teenage girl. Very rare that a size 10 is too big. These shoes are too big, no support to walk in let alone workout in. The laces don't really tighten the shoe. The insole is too small to fit the entire shoe so it felt like my toes were slipping off into the abyss. Not comfortable. Return for sure. Disappointed!"
Adidas,2,"Two things

1. Today is July 25th but in “my orders” is shows that this was delivered Tuesday, July 23rd...oh okay let’s just make up dates.
2. I’m actually amazed these are legitimate Adidas considering this is how the box arrived.

The shoes fit and look fine but come on people, at least  pretend to care about the customer."
Adidas,2,"Unfortunately had to return as these weren’t wide enough. I think soooo many of shows now don’t come to fit an actual foot. I don’t think I have an overly wide foot? But regardless, these looked cute, and would’ve been great if they were a bit wider."
Adidas,2,"Very comfortable, lightweight shoe BUT Low quality. I wear these 2-3 days a week and exactly 2 months in and the stripes are falling off. Not worth the money!"
Adidas,2,Very comfy until you start any type of running or HIIT training. Feet and knees had no support and I had to go back to my old shoes. Also somehow the shoes start twisting while working out. In the long run these shoes would be better for walking or light jogging.
Adidas,2,"Very flat, not very comfortable"
Adidas,2,Very hard to get your foot in. Fit is small
Adidas,2,Wanted a white shoe. Bought the white shoe. It’s actually light blue. Shoe fits ok however the opening is huge and not firm fitting. It’s a bit hard and I noticed it while running.
Adidas,2,"Wasn't aware they were slip-on style. The laces are purely ornamental. The side hems stick out a lot and rub into my feet. The foam cushion is also not very cushiony. They're the cheapest made shoes I've ever seen and extremely uncomfortable. Will be returning, and I advise anyone considering buying to not waste your time."
Adidas,2,"Way too light with no support. Also no treads on the bottom. Definitely not a running shoe. Fine for wearing out and about, but not for running."
Adidas,2,Way too small and narrow.
Adidas,2,We have the identical gray pair and the black is made smaller.  It's crazy!
Adidas,2,"What the heck happened to this box?
I bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas, however their is no way I can give her something that looked like I dug it out of the trash.
Come on... really?"
Adidas,2,When I opened my package my box was squished that wasn’t a big deal to me but then when I looked at the shoes there was glue on the top of the shoe that I could not get off. Also when I tried the shoes on the shoelaces to one of my shoes were uneven. I tried to fix them but with these shoes the shoe laces are inside so when I tried to adjust them they were twisted and unable to fix
Adidas,2,Why… the insole is weird it dips down around the edges. I could not get over this awkward feeling under my toes. Otherwise would have been a comfortable shoe and ran true to size . Had to return.
Adidas,2,"Without a regular tongue in the shoes they are difficult for me to put on. They are quite stylish but did not work for me. Once I put them on, they were too tight on top."
Adidas,2,Would not purchase again.
Adidas,2,"Would not recommend for anyone who is trying to do training, running/jogging, or cycling. The sole does not offer enough support from outside elements. I wore in a cycle class and my feet hut 15 min in.

The cloud foam is so comfy for hanging out, but offers no support for running & jogging. They are also too flexible so your feet will slide from side to side while doing agility exercises or any side to side movement (like side lunges).

I don't know if anyone else experienced this, but my toes also touch the sole beyond where the cloud foam stops so that is awkward and slightly uncomfortable.

Save your money and pass on these."
Asics,2,3rd time wearing them and the rubber part in front of the shoe is already unsticking from the cloth. The shoe laces are too thin as well. But I can say they are very comfy to walk on just dont know how much longer they would last. Definitely not buying again.
Asics,2,"After a week of using them, i started experiencing  neck pain, back pain and it was impossible to walk ... my feet were so painful.
I had to put them n the trash.
I will never use this brand again"
Asics,2,"After two months, these shoes are already falling apart. The insole is sliding around inside the shoe, which does nothing for the stability of the shoe. I work on my feet all day, and have had multiple ankle surgeries, which is why I was drawn to the product in the first place. For the price tag, I would have expected a more quality made product."
Asics,2,After walking only a mile the bottom of my feet ache
Asics,2,Any time I buy a tennis shoe at this same price from another manufacturer I don’t get the same support so I stick with Asics brand. I had to return them as I’ve purchased the same size Asics for years and these are too short. My big toe keeps hitting the end of the shoe. They are also too rounded on the top.
Asics,2,"As others have posted, these were initially very comfortable. I've had these for less than 5 months. I average 10-15,000 steps a day, mostly on sidewalks. While these were my primary shoes, they also aren't my only pair so they should have had a much longer life. As you can see in the photo, they have gotten holes in the toes. I'm switching back to my New Balance."
Asics,2,As stated above.
Asics,2,"At first these sneakers weren’t bad. They felt as new sneakers should. But when I picked up the miles and also started running, they were hurting my feet. They are trail runners so I was a bit disappointed. I decided instead of spending another $50+ on sneakers that might or might not fit right that I’d go to a local shoe store and be fitted properly. I was right that I take a 7 wide (as ordered) but the higher quality running shoes fit SO much better. The toe box was too small in these shoes and come to find out, the wide isn’t very wide. My new shoes, as fitted by a professional, feel so much better than these. You get what you pay for!"
Asics,2,Bought these for my wife - size 10D.  This is a great shoe for the price but the toe box was still not wide enough and if you have high arches these may be a little tight as well.
Asics,2,Cheap product. Would not recommend.
Asics,2,"Compared to the Gel Venture 6 this is a very poorly made shoe. I bought these six months ago; just now starting to wear them.  Poorly designed foot bed, cheap shoelaces, no support and they are wearing out after only 6-7 wearings. Materials used are very cheap compared to the Gel Venture 6. Will never again buy Asics. Asics have gone the way of Saucony, Nike, Adidas and all the other big brand names; cheap production and highest price point."
Asics,2,Did not feel like a 5.5. Too wide and long weak support. Going back to Brooks.
Asics,2,Didn’t fit
Asics,2,Disappointed. I have high arches and these did nothing for them
Asics,2,"Estos zapatos se vender para hacer ejercicio y correr específicamente, pero su suela y composición es muy rígida por lo que no es lo más aconsejable para hacer ejercicio"
Asics,2,"Felt great at first, but in less than a month my feet are hurting again and on the toes the rubber some is peeling away from toe end."
Asics,2,fITS LIKE A SLIPPER ... NO SUPPORT .. NOT GOOD FOR WALKING .. RETURNING PRODUCT
Asics,2,Fits perfectly. Very comfortable shoes!
Asics,2,For these reasons these shoes did not work for me:  Shoe strings were very flimsy and thin and stretchy; top fit so tight to the point it left an indentation after walking in my house a few minutes; returns are not easy - beware
Asics,2,Great support as always but the stripping across the top of the foot are tighter then the meshing so its making pressure points on the top of the fot after a while
Asics,2,Had to return as they were too small.
Asics,2,Have been wearing this brand for years. I put my arch supports inside and have plenty of room for my toes.
Asics,2,Heavyweight
Asics,2,I always wear 8.5 medium in Asics. These are tight and short in the toe area. I’m returning these and will order 8.5 wide to see if that fits better. I opted that instead of ordering a 9.0 in fear they would be too long. We will see.
Asics,2,"I always wear the same size in Asics shoes and the product information says ""fits as expected"".  Well, I ordered my usual size and they felt a bit too large.  I thought they'd be fine with thicker socks, but they are not comfortable.  I should have returned them.  Having second thoughts about ordering athletic shoes online!"
Asics,2,I am a nurse who is on her feet all day. I have always bought Asics and loved them. This pair and thedidn’t have the good support my older pairs.
Asics,2,"I am on my feet at work for 8-12 hours a day. Standing, walking, running, up and down stairs.. my feet don't rest until I get home. I really thought, after reading reviews, that these were THE shoes for all day wear. Unfortunately, they are not. They feel great for the first hour or so.. but by 2 hours in, you are already begging to take them off.
Not only do my feet kill me, my ankles are sore, my calves cramp up, my knees hurt more than I've ever experienced before, and even my hips feel out of line. I get more comfort out of wearing heeled booties for days in a row. These shoes are terrible. I wore them for a few months to see if breaking them in would help, and it didn't. These shoes have caused nothing but foot/leg pain.
Don't waste your money."
Asics,2,I am very dissappointed with these shoes..no arch and not very padded..had sore feet at the end of the first day..hoping that i can add inserts.
Asics,2,I bought these due to all the great reviews. I have multiple  pairs of asics.  This is by far the worse  shoe I ever wore. I worked all day in them and by end of day I was in so much pain from hips to toes. Never  will I by this particular brand again. I am wondering  if it's a knock off brand!!!
Asics,2,"I bought these shoes April 17, 2020 and now it the start of August 2020. In under 4 months the front end of it is ripping off and there are pieces of thread I am constantly trimming on the sides.

These shoes were amazing for a couple months... I just really wish they would’ve help up better. I’m going to try and get a few more uses in before the front tears even worse. I expect shoes to last at least around 8 months before needing replacement."
Asics,2,"I bought this shoes cause of my plantar fasciitis, but they’re very uncomfortable to me and run small. Order a bigger"
Asics,2,"I bought this sneaker since it is considered a trail running sneaker, but when I took it on a light trail, I found that the sole is too thin/flexible for trail running.  I could feel most rocks very distinctly through the shoes, which made the soles of my feet uncomfortable after 40 minutes of walking/running.  On the flat street the soles were fine, although the upper top of he sneaker is a bit stiff, so not my favorite choice for street running either.  I eventually replaced the sneaker's soft insert with a hard form-fitted insert, which helped to reduce the feeling of the rocks through the shoes somewhat.  I can use it on short runs/walks, but won't take it on the trail for longer than an hour.  For reference, I used to do trail running/walking with regular running ASICS Gel GT-1000 series sneakers which are not trail shoes, but I never felt the rocks so prominently with that sneaker.  These sneakers are cheaper, so I guess you get what you pay for.

I will say that I do like the traction on these sneakers, that part is good for the trail and helps keep me from slipping when I'm running/walking on a downhill slope.  And the color is great for trail running too.  I live in the southwest where the trails are very sandy.  The sneakers don't look dirty after trail running since they are already a greyish/cream color."
Asics,2,"I broke my ankle and was looking for a very supportive athletic shoe for after recovery.  After doing some research, I landed on this shoe. I liked the look and colors. On inspection, it looked like a very supportive shoe with nice padding around the ankle. It was true to colors. However, when I tried it on (my non-broken ankle), I noticed that my toes went all the way to the end. I am a solid size nine and have never had any problems ordering this size before. Also, the band of leather going across the top of the shoe at the end of the laces toward the toes was very tight. And the shoe laces were cheap and short."
Asics,2,"I buy new shoes every 6mts and normally buy Asics brand. They are comfortable and usually have great cushion. I've had these shoes for about 2 months and the cushion is practically gone. I'm not sure if these are true Asics or not, but they have not met my comfort level as other shoes have lasted the 6mts and still had good tread and cushion left in them. I am on the hunt for a new pair already, as these have my feet hurting after a days walk in them. I feel the hard concrete in every step."
Asics,2,I buy these shoes and model every year and this shoe had absolutely no cushioning or support compared to prior years. Not sure if these are fake or they changed the manufacturing but I went back to wearing my old shoes which still had more support than these brand new ones.
Asics,2,I don’t recommend this product. They are not slip resistant.
Asics,2,"I don't normally buy shoes online, but I honestly hate shopping while wearing a mask. So, to avoid the mask I've purchased 3 pairs of shoes off Amazon recently. All the shoes are great, although these ASICS must be seconds as the right shoe is slightly longer than the left shoe. Also, there is barely any arch support. However, given the price, they fit well enough for me to keep and I've added arch support insoles.

UPDATE: I decided to return the shoes. Wore them on two dog walks and the right shoe was just too uncomfortable. Both shoes had 9.5 size label, but the right shoe actually fit like a size 10 in length and was slightly a wider shoe, as well. No matter how tight I laced the shoe it did not keep my heel in place."
Asics,2,"I expected more comfort, I wear these for work as a Nurse and I prefer brooks"
Asics,2,"I had to return them. I tried to go down haf a size and get a wide fit. It was a good length but even the wide fit was too tight across my foot. I really like asics brand. They are the most comfortable shoes, but I'm really disappointed these didn't fit right."
Asics,2,"i had worn same shoes for many years,dont know what went wrong but this pair,but this one does not fit right. Back of shoe very low,my feet slips off.Arches in wrong places. I ordered 10W. I guess Wide part got lost somewhere. Disappointing. Returning,not going to order again."
Asics,2,I have a 2year old pair I don’t know what happened but it’s totally different the inside is cheap the soles are very hard. Maybe they are being made by a different place they my originals but the are terrible
Asics,2,"I have always trusted the ASICS brand. It has become the only brand I order for me and my son.
I kept these sneakers boxed up until my current pair of ASICS finally ripped. I have never had a problem with fit, however this pair seems too small. My toes feel very cramped causing pain and I have only worn them twice! I missed the cut off for return, but do I qualify for a future discount?"
Asics,2,I have always worn a 9 wide. I’ve always had good luck with ASICS until this pair. I think I may have arthritis in my toes. These were definitely not wide enough in the toes. They hurt like crazy.
Asics,2,"I have been a die hard ASICS fan for quite some time. As a nurse, good fitting running shoes are a must...at work or at home. I got these exactly one week ago today. You can tell by the pictures that the quality is subpar now. Crease lines in the toe box,ike they are a few years old. The name logo has mostly worn off on the inside of the left shoe already. I already had another pair of ASICS picked out, but I am sad to say I doubt I will buy any more of their items after these shoes. Shame."
Asics,2,I have been wearing versions of this model of ASICS for a decade and have never had a fit problem but not this pair.  The Toe box is too small even though the length is appropriate.  Unfortunately I learned this the hard way on the golf course and cannot return them.  Experienced sore toes by the 12 hole.  But I like the shoe and will buy a half size larger to see if the fit improves.
Asics,2,"I have bought ASICS for the last 5 years and they have been amazing! I wear customized orthotics and they fit them perfectly and are so comfortable even with the orthotics. I have bought the ASICS Gel-Venture 7 Carrier Gray/Silver and Mantle Green/Piedmont Grey and I have bought the ASICS Gel-Venture 6
Mid Grey/Purple Spec (twice) and Black/Pixel Pink (twice). Well I wanted a new color and since I have had great success with the Gel-Venture 6 and 7’s, I decided to order another pair in Peacoat/Hot Pink. Oh my gosh they were horrible! My feet were killing me at work ALL day. I had to put gas in my car at lunch and I had to do it barefoot because my feet hurt so bad. And I had to keep taking them off all day randomly at work. I’m so bummed because I’ve already worn them for a day and I can’t return them. What a waste of $70!"
Asics,2,I have owned several pair of Asics. They have been my preferred brand for 10 years now. These are the stiffest and most uncomfortable pair I have ever had.  They don't bend easily and there is NO cushion.
Asics,2,"I have used asics sneakers for years. I love the Ventura 5 model so I thought the Ventura 7 would similar. Boy was I wrong. This shoe was so unfortunately that tried leaving blisters within 10 min of wearing them. It was not too small either, just the design of the toe box area. I returned them as this was not going to work out for me at all."
Asics,2,"I have worn this style for years and sadly, the show is more stiff and narrow then it used to be.  I imagine a new manufacturer is making them and cutting them differently.  Darn. I finally find a shoe and now have to start all over again to find a different one.  Darn it!"
Asics,2,"I like Asics, and my Asics Venture 5 is the best pair of trail running shoes I've owned. I bought the Venture 7 thinking they'd be the 'new, improved' version. Nope. These are flimsy and cheap, and don't resemble the Venture 5 in construction, durability or materials. The 7's might be good for people who like light, flexible shoes, but I look for sturdiness and support in trail running shoes. Re-purchased the Venture 5."
Asics,2,I like the shoes and they fit great but I have only had them 3 months and they have a hole in the toe!!! I paid $65 for these shoes!! Not very happy 😡
Asics,2,I like the way it looks but it feels too loose and hurt when I tried walking in them
Asics,2,"I normally wear a size 9.
I bought a 9 1/2 in the shoe thinking I would be giving myself some extra room because my feet hurt so much at the end of the day but this shoe is tighter than my 9, and stiff and uncomfortable. I’m very disappointed because ASICS came highly recommended."
Asics,2,I ordered 10.5 wide but what I got was very narrow  and couldn't  not fit at all. I usually wear 9.5-10 wide so I figured 10.5 wide would fit. It couldn't even get on.
Asics,2,I ordered 7.5 Wide...which usually fits me perfectly.  I wish I  tried them on before I threw out the box...they are too narrow... trying to sell them
Asics,2,I ordered a wide and they are very narrow. That is unlike ASICS. They are usually true to size.
Asics,2,I ordered an 8 wide apparently it must be a 7wide because it sure doesn't fit comfortably. I Will not buy from this company again.
Asics,2,"I Ordered black and silver, the black looks more like a navy."
Asics,2,"I ordered this shoe because it came up when I searched for ""shoes for plantar fasciitis"".  I have a very high arch and need good support.  This shoe did not have as much as I expected.
The shoes are attractive but I did return them."
Asics,2,"I really like the company Zappos.
These asics were narrow for my foot.
And these were wide shoes."
Asics,2,"I recently bought these to complete a long distance hike in.  Many of my miles are hwy miles and not trail, so I needed something reputable and light weight. Unfortunately I’m very disappointed. I went with ASICS because of the brand recognition and reputation, but I’ll have to upgrade to the more expensive trail brands out there because these offer very poor foot support. I’m breaking them in at my house on padded flooring &  during HIIT training and I can feel the lack of cushion— especially in the front/toe  during high impact movements.  My 10 year old nikes offer better support.

I wanted to believe the hype reviews, but I can’t do 20+ miles a day in these.  Neighborhood strolls, you’ll be fine."
Asics,2,"I run 5 days a week about 4 to 7 miles per run on gravel/sand terrain. At first these shoes were fantastic. They fit well and supported my flat feet plus I loved the colors. But after about 120 miles (about a month and a half) of running in these shoes, they started to fall apart and lose support. Due to these shoes deteriorating so quickly, I’ve suffered a minor injury and now have to take a break from my runs to allow myself time to recover. If you’re serious about running and want to avoid injury, spend the extra money and get some quality running shoes. These are a rip off."
Asics,2,I suspect these are fake.  They are much lower quality than my usual ASICS sneakers.  I slipped and fell the first day I wore them.  Be careful when ordering.
Asics,2,I thought the size was not true.
Asics,2,"I use these for jogging. These have little support and feel very hard some. No softness for just walking.  I use ASICS gel 19 and these are a good quality shoe.  So disappointed. I am looking for another brand at this time.
Please don’t say these a running shoe!"
Asics,2,I usually wear an 8 1/2 or 9.  I ordered a 9 and it was a tight fit.  Going to return and try a 9 1/2.  Giving 2 stars because I think there sizes are way off.
Asics,2,I wanted to like these since I’ve been a huge fan of ASICS. I wore them for a few months using them to walk outside mostly and they started to fall about pretty quickly. Mainly the back part of the shoe started cutting into my heals until it started bleeding. The toe box was also pretty narrow. I had this happen after buying one full size up.
Asics,2,"I wanted to love them but they're just not for me.  The color is nice and true to the photo, the shoes are well made, and the fit is correct, but the shoe is overall very stiff.  This wouldn't concern me except the sole is very stiff too.  For me, trail hiking needs a sturdy but flexible sole.  These were returned painlessly thanks to Amazon Prime."
Asics,2,"I was extremely disappointed.  I have a high arch and plantar fasciitis, where my feet hurt when I am on them for any length of time.  I researched and saw that these shoes had high arch support.  However, when I received them and put them on, I found that there was absolutely little to zero arch support."
Asics,2,"I was looking for a more affordable option to my go-to Brooks, but these were not it. They are stiff and not very cushy.  I only wear these for a short outing or a couple quick laps around my work place. Any longer than that, I get cramps in my legs and toes. I'm sure other people will have better luck with these than I did."
Asics,2,"I was super excited to get a new pair of sneakers and I looked for days and read tons of reviews online. I ended up choosing these ASICS Gel Venture 7 shoes after reading reviews. My husband warned me not to get ASICS as he is a runner and tried them in the past and hated them. But I got them anyway thinking he's just too picky. Unfortunately, he was right. I had read these have great support but they don't. They are extremely hard on the feet and super uncomfortable. I got a 8.5W as that's my normal size but these do not feel like wides and they run big. My pinky toe rubs against the shoe and my heel slips out of the back. I normally just buy Sketchers and I should have done so again. If you have wide feet I do not recommend these shoes. If you plan to do a lot of walking in these I don't not recommend these shoes. They are fine for short distances or running errands but I used to them for a vacation that had a lot of walking and these were awful. Which is all very sad because I loved the design of these! That's really the only bright side about these is the design."
Asics,2,"I’ve a,ways worn ASICS shoes but these shoes hurt my feet."
Asics,2,"I’ve owned various pairs of the Gel Ventures (maybe 5 or 6) over the last few years. They’ve been my go to shoe for work and walking and have always held up well. This pair disappointed me. The stitching over the big toes has unraveled after only 3 months of indoor use at work. I’m bummed as now I’ll have to find a different go to shoe.
I would appreciate it if someone would contact me regarding this order."
Asics,2,"I've worn size 8.5 running shoes my entire adult life.  Though my feet are on the wide side, it's not enough that I need the wide width shoes.  My last two pairs were ASICS Venture 5 and I loved them, so I took a chance and ordered the Venture 7's.  Wow, it was like I had ordered a whole size smaller.  Extremely tight at the toe box (though ASICS claims on their web site that Venture 7's are roomier than previous versions)...my feet hurt immediately.  So they're going right back."
Asics,2,Laces untie non stop while working out
Asics,2,Las zapatillas no traen arco y no es muy bueno para correr.
Asics,2,Like many others have worn ASICS for many years....walk about 5 miles a day....after 3 days I have horrible knee and hip pain....soles seem plastic and don’t bend.....this shoe was about half the price of my other ASICS.....maybe you do get what you pay for but wow...... thousands of great reviews...I disagree!
Asics,2,Look nice. The green is darker than expected and they ran really small
Asics,2,"Looks good, but uncomfortable shoes."
Asics,2,Loop where shoe lace goes through broke as soon as I tried pulling the shoe laces together and the support is awful. You can find better shoes within this brand at that price. I wouldn’t buy. Look for something else.
Asics,2,"Love the fit and they're super comfortable. But I bought a pair on January 20th of this year, 2020 and there is already a worn area all the way through the fabric on my right pinky toe. And they fit perfectly. Not happy about that especially for 60 bucks"
Asics,2,"Love the looks of these but no arch support and everyone likes memory foam, actually I hate it. Now I'm looking for the perfect insoles to put in these. Not impressed."
Asics,2,Loved the look of the shoe but it wasn’t wide enough.
Asics,2,"Low quality, fit is small and uncomfortable"
Asics,2,Made from hard garbage material.
Asics,2,"My feet begin to hurt after just a short time wearing these shoes. This is the first time that I have had an ASICS pair of shoes that hurt from the beginning. I usually have to break a pair down completely before they hurt my feet and knees. I ordered the same size I always get in ASICS but these feel a bit smaller. I don't understand how a brand can have differences in sizes between different models of basically the same thing - they are all running shoes, after all. I won't get this style again. I may try to find the older model I had before but it has been discontinued so it is harder to find. :("
Asics,2,My foot felt like it was bound up in the shoe! I've been wearing Asics running shoes for many years now. I usually buy a half size bigger than my normal sneakers to have a little extra room. These are even smaller than my normal shoe size in length and width. I was running on Gel-Venture 6 and didn't think 7s would be that different.
Asics,2,My wife and I got this shoe but after long walks we both get ankle blisters. We had the previous model and we did not have the same problem. I do not recommend this one.
Asics,2,"Narrow foot bed, hard sole"
Asics,2,"Nice shoes, but instep and arch support was too high for me. My feet hurt when I took them off. I'm sure this was just due to my foot shape. Might be great for someone else."
Asics,2,"No arc support, too flat. Not a good running shoe"
Asics,2,"Not as comfortable as I was expecting from ASICS. I’ve always bought ASICS through the last decade because I’m on my feet all day, and they used to provide better support. This pair however causes my plantar fasciitis to flare up and I’m not able to wear them to work."
Asics,2,Not as good for walking as I expected
Asics,2,"Not comfortable at all. Very stiff, no “gel” sensation at all."
Asics,2,Not comfortable at all...
Asics,2,Not like my other ASICS! These have very little cushion and the support is lacking. I’ve worn asics for 15 years and these are not what I’m used to. Disappointed but already wore them so I can’t return :-(
Asics,2,Not much cushion. Hard bottoms. Would not purchase again. Only plus is the toe box area.
Asics,2,"Oh my goodness these shoes are HOT, HOT, HOT! Walking is more if an effort that my Merrill's... the price was right... but unfortunately simply did not work!"
Asics,2,Ok show for walking. I do not recommend for running unless you like getting injured from lack of support.
Asics,2,Ordered size I always wear; heel didn’t fit right and toe to the end.
Asics,2,"Product was a good fit. Reasonable price.  My only dislike is the color I ordered was not what I received.
I ordered Black/Silver but received
Navy/ Turquoise. I was in need of running shoes as am on vacation. Other wise I would have sent them back ."
Asics,2,Quality is subpar with past orders of this product
Asics,2,Quality shoe with the exception the padding can not be removed to add personal inserts.  Planters fasciitis flare with this shoe.
Asics,2,Really like them but size was to small make sure you get one size up
Asics,2,"Really liked appearance of shoe.  However, inside of  shoe at the front—where material is sewn together above the toe area—-there is a “ridge” and consequently bothers the top of my toes.  I am returning the shoes."
Asics,2,"Really liked shoe, very comfortable BUT developed a hole in the toe after very minimal wear.  I only had them for 7 weeks."
Asics,2,Returning and ordering a bigger size but other then that my daughter loves them !!!
Asics,2,Run small!
Asics,2,Run smaller than most shoes of this brand.
Asics,2,Run smaller than previous styles
Asics,2,Sadly these running shoes did not hold up well. I had to replace them in less than 90 days of lighter use because the pink rubber sole peeled away on the front of both shoes.
Asics,2,Says there wide but they feel as if they werent . The feel average . So probably either wear with.no wocks or order up
Asics,2,"Seller doesn't allow returns.  The shoes were too small for my daughter and now they are just sitting in the box, unused."
Asics,2,"Shoe fits well, sole is easily worn off with just walking.. chunks come off of it."
Asics,2,"Shoe is a very comfortable shoe if you have a slim foot.  I compared my New Balance insole with the ASICS, one picture side by side and the other picture with the ASICS sole on top of the New Balance.  BIG difference for both of these shoes supposedly being an 8 WIDE.  THe ASICS is 1 and 1/4"" smaller where your arch is and 1/4"" smaller in the toe box.  I can only where the ASICS shoes for a few hours before I have to take them off.  The New Balance shoes I can wear all day long (Model W1540V2)."
Asics,2,Shoes are heavy
Asics,2,Shoes did not fit the same as previous version of this shoe has in the past. It felt stiff. The heel was short and kept slipping no matter how many different types of lacing I tried. There appears to be a seam right across the heel that digs into my heel also that makes them more uncomfortable. As I checked the stores. All their new versions of trail shoes appeared to have this. Disappointing because I loved this brand.
Asics,2,"Shoes fit a little larger than my normal shoe size. But not bad. There’s some discomfort in my ankles after wearing them for the frat day. But hopefully they need to just be broken in. My issue with these shoes is in the design. I don’t buy shoes that often so when I do buy them I would like them to be worth every penny I spent. These shoes are not. They press on the top of my ankles and are not sized wrong not the worst things in the world and I could learn to live with these issues if it weren’t for the discrepancies in the sewing if the pink trim. The pink inside lining of the shoes is supposed to extend to the second set of eyelets on the laces. On one shoe they are noticeably shorter on one side. On the other shoe, the pink part is already unraveling after just 4 hours of wearing them. It’s almost like they are seconds. Like they didn’t pass quality control. Just double check everything on the stitching before wearing them because most places won’t take them back after they’ve been worn. Or better yet. Look for a better quality shoe."
Asics,2,"Shoes fit great, unfortunately can't actually run in them yet since they arrived with a security tag on the left shoe. Otherwise in great condition"
Asics,2,"Should have listened to a previous reviewer . . . . the Black/Piedmont Grey is not have a purple tone as the picture's denote.  It is a very dark blue including the side of the sole is very dark blue.  No way that picture is this shoe. I am very disappointed and am returning.  I""m giving two stars because otherwise these are great shoes and it arrived a day earlier than expected."
Asics,2,Sizing runs small
Asics,2,"Smashes the big toe when I walk, no arch support."
Asics,2,"So, I decided to give an updated review about these shoes. I originally gave 5 stars because they fit well and were comfortable from day 1. However, as you can see from the photo, these shoes I've had for less than 5 months have started to rip at the toe on each shoe. I was hoping they would last as long as my previous Asics (which was YEARS), but as you can see they are not holding up well. I walk 4-5 days a week. I'm not walking through terrain that justifies these holes, and I noticed someone else reported a similar problem. So, at this point, I can no longer recommend this shoe. Look for another brand that won't fall apart so quickly.😩"
Asics,2,Style was nice as was insole. I usually wear wide width  but these were too wide
Asics,2,Stylish and fit true to size but not for running or aerobic exercise.
Asics,2,The color is NOT black/silver as advertised.  It is clearly navy blue.  I ordered the black to wear with black work pants so I’m disappointed. The shoes otherwise fit well and are comfortable.
Asics,2,The color orange in the picture is more coral/pink in reality.
Asics,2,"The exterior tread has good grip, but I can't recommend this shoe for trail running or any high impact activity. There is no arch support or cushioning on the inside of the shoe. The exterior upper might as well be 100% mesh.  The colorful exterior design is merely decorative - it doesn't provide any support or protection. This sneaker is fine for indoor wear or casual about town use."
Asics,2,The hill slips out too easily because the hill area is too wide.  The color is not what I thought it would be. WILL return
Asics,2,The last Asic shoes I bought were so comfortable. These had little solid cushion.
Asics,2,"The reason for a lower rating is because I'm irritated that these shoes were advertised as wide and yet they are not...i wonder how narrow a regular shoe is? To simply label a shoe as wide, does not make them so. If you are needing a wide fit, do NOT order these."
Asics,2,"The shoe fits well and is comfortable.  However, they have the worse soles I have ever encountered.  The soles grab and lock dirt/grass in them to be tracked inside.  Stomping your feet before walking indoors does not even help.  I would never buy these again and wish I could exchange them."
Asics,2,"The shoe offers good support and is very light. However,  I would have preferred an extra oz. because it has absolutely no padding except for the tongue. I have to wear an extra thick sock to compensate for it. It fits well but makes my feet look huge."
Asics,2,The shoes fit too small even though I ordered a 1/2 size too big. They are tight around the toes too even with wide width.
Asics,2,The shoes hurt my feet and make blisters on my heel.  Wish I could return them.
Asics,2,"The shoes look good and are as I expected them to be, however, I ordered the wide width and these shoes are anything but wide. They seem very narrow."
Asics,2,The sneakers are not true to the description. No gel at all is used in this sneaker. I had to buy my own inserts for them so they can have some shock absorbers in them. Ver hard soles.
Asics,2,"The stitching around my toes on the left shoe is
coming undone. I am sure the shoes will be unwearable after a few more wearings."
Asics,2,The venture 7 is not the same as the previous venture 4-6. The design is changed and no longer suits the needs of my feet.  So disappointed.
Asics,2,"These are not like the past asics that I’ve known and loved. They got holes very quickly even though I always make sure to untie my shoe laces before removing them, which should help prevent this kind of wear. Very disappointed."
Asics,2,"These are super comfy and the really good outdoor running shoes are not too easy on the eyes.  I haven't tried them on trails or on the treadmill yet, but for pavement and sidewalk activity, they're not too supportive in the ball of the foot.  They seem extremely cushy when you first put them on, but as soon as I started walking the support flattened out real quick.  Returned and will be going back to Brooks.  Not even worth keeping for light use."
Asics,2,"These do not fit my wide feet even though I ordered the wide pair, disappointed"
Asics,2,"These don’t have much support and they are uncomfortable.
They are already falling apart and I’ve only hiked in them twice!"
Asics,2,"These really hurt my toes. I don’t normally review, but these don’t fit well."
Asics,2,These shoes are cute but did not provide me any support.  I purchased them to exercise by walking alas it was a fail.  My feet hurt and they offered no comfort of any kind.... Money wasted
Asics,2,These shoes are nice and comfortable. I just took stars because they are slippery in wet tile.
Asics,2,"These shoes are not true to size. When I tried to walk in them, the area where the shoe creases near the toes is really tight. Shoes are too narrow in the front and cut off circulation. I can't do anything with these shoes. And I'm out $75. I tried to return them but Amazon wouldn't let me."
Asics,2,These shoes are really tight across the top of the foot where the laces end near the toe so you can’t adjust it. Very disappointing. I thought they would have stretched out by now but they are so uncomfortable I cannot wear them.
Asics,2,"These shoes are unbearable to run in. The left shoe gives me a sharp pain on the side of my foot when wearing, a feeling I’ve only ever experienced in poor fitting ski boots. The heel of my right foot screams in pain after wearing them. I’ve never experienced such pain from running shoes."
Asics,2,These shoes run small
Asics,2,"These sneakers are a bit smaller than others I've purchased from ASICS. I wish manufacturers would stop changing the sizes of shoes like they have changed the size of cereal boxes.  An 8.5 is an 8.5, not an 8.25.
They fit, but they're not as roomy as others I've purchased in the past."
Asics,2,"These were talked up so much, they are not very comfortable."
Asics,2,"They are very uncomfortable and hard. I am very disappointed. I read the reviews and heard all good things, especially for heal pain and plantar. They don't help. I think im sending these back."
Asics,2,"They feel cheap and uncomfortable. The outsole is made of some unpleasant plastic and is uneven. There is not enough cushioning under the ball of the foot and the toe ad much more on the other side. If you happen to have an overpronation, then this will probably make things worse. However, this model may be good for underpronation. Please, pay attention that Asics does different models for different pronation. Unfortunately, in many cases, this is not explained clearly to customers. Many may not even know what pronation is and probably buying the wrong shoes. Also, models made for overpronation are for some reason the most expensive. This information is available on the Asics website. I actually mentioned overpronation on one of my feet after I was wearing Asics Onitsuka Tiger model for a year or two. So it may be a result of wearing the wrong shoes I guess. I think Asics need to add some tags with clear information about the model type and what pronation is. Otherwise, they are creating possible orthopedic problems for us."
Asics,2,"They look nice, however I wound up being unable to use them,  I ordered a pair that was a 10.5 wide however there was no difference between their regular and wide variety. I ended up giving the shoes to my roommate."
Asics,2,"They run small, like half size small, more narrow that I wanted. And the color.... I ordered the Black/Sliver and it came as navy, grey and lavender. I guess they don't know what black and grey is. too bad because they are comfortable. Because of that and the good price I decided to keep them for my around the house shoes. I had originally ordered them for work at the clinic. I decided to try another pair in another color and a half size bigger."
Asics,2,"This shoe looks navy in the picture but THESE SHOES ARE ALL PURPLE!! EVEN THE SOLES!  Not a purple fan, so disappointed by that."
Asics,2,"This show has been recommended as a good work shoe for workers who walk on concrete.  This shoe is fine for a rec shoe but does not meet my work needs.  My shoe size is 6.5.  Bought 7.  Even so, shoes too short.  Toes bunched.  Toe tops rub against shoe top.  Keeping shoe for rec but going to nurses shoe store for new work shoe."
Asics,2,"Thought I did my homework before purchasing these sneakers. They are very expensive for what they offer.  I purchased a size 8 although I wear a 7 1/2. My toes are at the tip which is what I tried to avoid. I purchased these because I thought they were a great alternative to buying actual orthotic sneakers for over pronation and flat feet. They have a special bar under the sneaker to prevent over pronation but they are not supportive as advertised by ASICS.  I wear size M in most sneakers. No way, are they a size M. They feel like they fit those with a narrow foot. I tried finding orthotic inserts but they only make the shoe feel even tighter.  On the positive side, the color is great."
Asics,2,To small
Asics,2,Toes tearing open on both shoes 5 weeks after purchase.
Asics,2,Too much hard plastic
Asics,2,Too wide in the heel. Too much slippage. Returned for credit.
Asics,2,Trying to walk more so bought these to help the pain I get in my feet. I didn’t like them at all. Even tried new insoles in them and still hurt my feet. Back to using my old shoes with the new insoles. I just need some good shoes 😭
Asics,2,Very comfortable to walk in but has like a hard cushion that presses against the sides of my foot that really bothered me.
Asics,2,"Very disappointed in this pair of Venture 7's.  They are beautiful (the red tones are wonderful) shoes but run way short, as well as narrow in both width and toe depth.  I have three pair of Venture 6's (one is just a couple weeks old) , plus two ""old"" pair of Venture 5's, all of which fit perfectly and are SO COMFORTABLE...but not this pair of Venture 7's.  Wonder if Asics changed the last/overall shape with their Ventures model for the #7 issue??  This pair is being returned, needless to say."
Asics,2,Very disappointing. No ache supports.
Asics,2,"Very narrow, zero arch support, and not enough padding. It was worth a shot but I returned them and went back to Gel venture 5"
Asics,2,"Way to heavy, more like hiking shoes. Not comfortable"
Asics,2,Wife said shoes were heavy and made feet hot. We sent back for refund.
Asics,2,Would not fit leather sides too small
New_Balance,2,7.5 wide was tight
New_Balance,2,"A very comfortable shoe. Enjoyed it for walks and weight workouts.
Unfortunately in two months it developed rips and had to be returned"
New_Balance,2,Absolutely horrible. I didn’t realize these were neoprene shoes with a sneaker base. Excessive stretch makes your foot slip out and feel unsecured. No support or arch shaping because these are neoprene. Laces are basically for decoration. Nice and lightweight and stylish for a casual street shoe but I can’t believe these are so highly rated on here as a gym shoe. I wouldn’t feel secure wearing these for gym training. Definitely not a running shoe but I wasn’t planning to use them for that.
New_Balance,2,Absolutely no arch support!
New_Balance,2,Advertised as footwear for bunion sufferers. Bought size 8D- which is a wide width. The toe box is not wide at all and the shoe itself is too short lengthwise to be a true size 8. It also fits extremely tightly over the instep. Shoe is more like a size 7M.  Can’t wear them. Disappointed and returning.
New_Balance,2,After 10hrs of wear these make a terrible clicking noise when you walk! I can’t figure out what’s going on. The noise drives me insane but they’re incredibly comfortable.  I’m on my feet 10-12hrs at work and my feet still feel great. If it wasn’t for the clicking/popping noise when I walk these would be an excellent purchase.
New_Balance,2,"After reading previous reviews regarding the tightness of the fit when you first try the shoe on, I was prepare for the snug fit. However, the shoe ripped on the just shortly after reaching the 40 day mark. For that reason, I do not recommend this show. It obviously does not hold up."
New_Balance,2,After reading reviews on these sneakers I purchased them and returned them as soon as came.  They run SMALLLLLL.  I’m typically an 8.5-9 depending on the brand so I went with a 9 thinking they’d be a little big..They fit like an 8.  My toes were ready to bust out of the top.  They offer no support and are very thin and flimsy.  They look really nice but that’s about it.
New_Balance,2,After several months of wearing I have decided to adjust my original 4Stars to 2 Stars because the padding on the feet have compressed and feel like you are walking on the hard ground with zero arch or foot support.
New_Balance,2,"After wearing these a few times it became obvious that something is very wrong with the left shoe.  It is made in a way that forces my foot to the inside. It took a few wears to figure out it was the shoe, and not me walking funny.  You can clearly see that it is constructed crookedly.
 Now I find that I’m past the window to return the shoes. I really just want a replacement for the defective shoe.  The right one is very comfortable, the left one not at all.  I’m going to try to get a replacement."
New_Balance,2,"All of my New Balance athletic shoes are size 7s so after reading the description  and reviews, I ordered a pair of size 7s.  However, after trying them on, they are shorter and tighter than my other New Balance shoes.  I'm returning this pair and exchanging them for a half size larger."
New_Balance,2,"Although these shoes are somewhat comfortable, they are not very durable. The bottoms are falling apart. I am so disappointed! I work at the USPS so I’m walking constantly. I need reliable and durable shoes. These are not it! I want my $50 back. 😑"
New_Balance,2,Athe sneaker wore too much in a month.  I walk every day 3 miles and never had a sneaker wear down that quickly plus I washed the first pair and part of the sole cushion came out.  Very disappointed as I only buy NB and I was happy they were so light in weight.
New_Balance,2,bad product wife has these shoes and they fit bought these ones and they do not fit at all
New_Balance,2,Black sneakers purchased are actually an unexpected shade of navy.
New_Balance,2,Bought these to be new work shoes they feel worse than the old ones the middle is too small so you’re walking on the side of the shoe and my big toe was sore from rubbing aunt the front I suggest to get a size up and a wide
New_Balance,2,"BUYER BEWARE! I purchased these on Amazon for $64.95 via prime.  When I received the shoes, they came with a Marshall's price tag of $39.99.  I spoke with customer service and they were unwilling to make any adjustments as they noted it was a third party seller.  While I do understand it is a third party seller, I feel that Amazon should back these errors.  As a consumer, it puts a bad taste in your mouth knowing you just paid $25 more for a pair of shoes.  Maybe they should be more conscious on what third party sellers are selling items for and be sure all lower priced tags are removed from products before they are shipped.

Otherwise, these are my favorite kind of shoes.  Very comfortable and fits great.  Have multiple pairs.  Just will have to be more cautious on where I purchase them from now on."
New_Balance,2,Comfortable but already after 2 weeks looking like they will not make it long.
New_Balance,2,Comfortable but provides no support. Podiatrist said worse shoe I could wear while dealing with plantar fasciitis. I used it twice And was in pain after. No longer of any use to me.
New_Balance,2,Cute but not made well poor support.
New_Balance,2,"cute shoe, sloppy fit ... too wide by toes
shoe broke after 2 weeks.. cheap"
New_Balance,2,Cute shoe. Sole inserts were not properly glued down so they fold up and come out every time you take your shoe off.
New_Balance,2,"Cute shoes, insole is comfortable.  You just have to be careful.  The shoes not only offer no arch support, it felt like they increased my pronation.  I returned them.  Probably great for people who need no support whatsoever."
New_Balance,2,"Definitely need to order a half size up.  I wear a 9 and ordered both a 9 and 9.5 based on the reviews.  9.5 fit perfect.  However, they are very low cut around the ankle.  Wearing them with low cut socks looks weird. You would have to either wear the lowest no show sock you can find or no socks at all.  And, really these are what I call a ""knocking around"" shoe.  I run and cross train and these do not have any support.  However, they do have a cushioned foot bed..  If you wear your shoes without socks for running errands or casual wear then these would be great.  If you need support, want to run in them or like to wear higher socks I can't recommend.  I have to return them."
New_Balance,2,"ES UN ZAPATO COMODO ,PERO DE MALA CALIDAD NO LO VOLVERIA A COMPRAR"
New_Balance,2,"Few things.... to start out the shoes are very nice looking! On the negative, they run SMALL I mean VERY small! I am usually a size 9, I ordered a size 10 (because of reviews) and it was still too small. Second the shoes is not supportive, my knees hurt so bad after a long nursing shift. The shoe laces will not stay tied, the material is one that you cannot tighten and even when double knotted they still come undone. Lastly, the shoes click when walking down the hallway, super irritating when trying to be quite going into a patient’s room."
New_Balance,2,Finally found the perfect shoe for work. I am a nurse working 12 hour shifts. These are so comfortable! Almost like walking on a pillow. I want a pair in every color.
New_Balance,2,Fit
New_Balance,2,"Fit feels a little loose and not very stable as far as balance goes. But they also seem to run a bit small though, because my toe always hits the front."
New_Balance,2,"Fit is ok, but the support of the shoe is awful. The outer material has zero support, so feet lean to the side. I thought maybe it was just my feet, but I had someone else try them, and it did the same. Would not recommend"
New_Balance,2,Fit perfectly but when I wore them for a walk it made my feet hurt.  Not enough cushion.
New_Balance,2,fit was not good. small for usual size and arch support was rigid and uncomfortable
New_Balance,2,Fits a size small extremely tight. Also very narrow
New_Balance,2,Fits very small
New_Balance,2,"Footbed is not removable to use an orthotic.  Shoe runs small - about a half size shorter than any other 10-1/2 I've owned.  Too bad, its a cute shoe with a pivot point for aerobic dance."
New_Balance,2,"For me, the product is too small. Need to get 1/2 size larger.  Pay attention to the percentages! Fit percentage is 71% for this item. I was hoping to be within that bracket but unfortunately I'm not. Will order again adding a 1/2 size."
New_Balance,2,"Get so many compliments on these shoes..they look great, they're easy to put on and they feel great on my feet! I wear 7 1/2 and they fit perfectly."
New_Balance,2,"Great looking shoes but they run small. I tried ordering the next 1/2 size up but, no luck. I had no choice but to return these shoes."
New_Balance,2,"Great slip on shoe for work until the smell, I don't sweat excessively on my feet; but after a few months the smell was unbearable even after a washing machine cycle."
New_Balance,2,Has no arch support. I got a WW and still feel it fit a little on the snug side considering it’s a wide width.
New_Balance,2,Have bought other shoes of new balance brand and am disappointed in the fit of this shoe. Too small across the arch and very little support.
New_Balance,2,"Have had these shoes for about four months now and they have stretched out so much they’re nearly impossible to wear. They are very cute but I am super disappointed in how they stretched out and are now too big and really not comfortable at all.

Workmanship is excellent though and the materials are high quality, so stars reflect that, not the fit."
New_Balance,2,I am a runner and the shoe has no support for running. My toes hurt after I use them. I have wore them twice and will never wear them again.
New_Balance,2,"I am a size 7.5 in every shoe.  In this one, the 7.5 fit more like a sock.  My toes were all the way to the end and it was tight all around.

Order up!!"
New_Balance,2,I am normally a size 7.5 or 8. Decided to go with an 8 since my intention was to use these shoes as workout shoes and didn't want them to fit to tight. Put the size 8 on when arrived and they were SUPER snug. Waited a day to decide if I could get away with the way they fit and definitely can not. Bummed that I have to return and extra bummed that I have to pay to return them. My recommendation would be to order a size up for sure.
New_Balance,2,"I am returning these, because I walked around my kitchen for 5 mins and my feet were already hurting.

The memory foam is soft but it compresses and then youre just walking on the rubber essentially. Theres also not any arch support.

I have another pair of New Balance Ortholite sneakers that I LOVE so much, but they dont really make that type of insole anymore. I was hoping these would compare but... they really felt cheap and hurt my feet."
New_Balance,2,I bought 2 pairs of NB shoes at the same time. These were cheaper but are by far the comfiest.
New_Balance,2,"I bought some insole for these and they are quite good for my 12 hour shift at a warehouse.

***Update***
The material is too thin at the front for warehouse. A splinter went right through it and stabbed my foot. My feet slipped too much in the shoe and now my two index toes are bruised. So these must be for light walking or every day shoes."
New_Balance,2,"I bought these based on reviews only.  The first time I wore them, they were fine but the next day after a full day of walking, my right foot had a burning sensation on the ball of the foot.  This is not normal for any of my shoes  It is too late to return them as I have worn them a few days.  I will continue to wear for short time periods but not depend on them for long term wear."
New_Balance,2,I bought these for working out but they don’t have good support or cushion. More of a fashion athletic shoe I suppose.
New_Balance,2,"I bought these in January and they were destroyed by April. They were really comfortable but they got several holes in the toe. If you're buying these to look cute and wear once in a while, go for it. If you're looking for a durable, everyday shoe skip these!"
New_Balance,2,"I bought these shoes for in the home only, Its been a couple weeks and they’ve become extremely uncomfortable on the pad of my foot. There is a hard part of the shoe that is felt through the insert, I’ve even replaced this with a dr scholes insert and it’s still bothersome to walk in or stand in. Very disappointed."
New_Balance,2,I bought this work 12 hour work shifts where I am on my feet a lot. After about two weeks the support just was not there and I felt like I was just walking directly on the ground.
New_Balance,2,"I did not find this shoe durable enough for daily exercise.  I walk three miles a day, and it was really not supportive enough for actual exertion.  It was fine for knocking around the house or a quick trip to the store."
New_Balance,2,I did not read reviews before ordering so size up because these fit small.
New_Balance,2,I didn't like the the shoe. The material was hard thinking it was a soft leather. Gave them to my mother. She like them
New_Balance,2,"I dislike that I was not clear on the actual shoe. It was not the original ""New Balance"" Shoe.
These shoes are light weight and thin in the soles. I would not recommend them."
New_Balance,2,I do recommend going up a half size. I had a lot of new balance shoes and all are size 8. These fit extremely tight.
New_Balance,2,I don’t like that the red extends all the way to the other side. I also don’t like that it is Disney. I did not know it was Disney and therefore had to take out the mini mouse red polkadot bowtie off of the shoelaces. At least the Mickey Mouse emblem is black so you can’t see it.
New_Balance,2,I feel that this product is not sufficient in trackton on wet surfaces. I have fell twice on wet surfaces. Thus resulting in damage to the knee that I had a partial knee replacement last year!!!!! Beware! I am applying to send them back with a full refund!!!
New_Balance,2,I first got a size 9 and then 9.5. these shoes are not comfortable. No sole support or support for arches (I have flat feet).
New_Balance,2,"I gave it 2 stars because it’s light weight which I really liked, but I could feel the floor; they need to make it more cushioned. My feet hurt at the end of my shift because of that."
New_Balance,2,I got the black and gray. Definitely size up like the other reviews said. I’ve been wearing these for about a week now and I’ve had so much aching in my shins and knees. They are very light and flimsy. Not much support at all. I feel like it’s the equivalent to the $10 sneakers at Walmart. I’m not satisfied at all with my purchase and will be looking for a new pair of shoes very soon.
New_Balance,2,I got this shoes in5/13/2020 and the sole of the left shoe is already starting to come unglued. Other then this I absolutely love this shoes.
New_Balance,2,I had different answers from the company on returning an item that wasn't big enough to put on a Barbie DOLL. They promised a return label...Never sent it.  I contacted A-Z.  They stated I have to pay to return it.  Then they will refund your money.  Only time will tell.
New_Balance,2,I had high hopes for these shoes but thankfully not to run or jog in. These are not as comfortable as they’d have you believe - No arch support. I’m keeping them but I’m not interested in buying any more.
New_Balance,2,I hate the style of these shoes.  The tongue area was super loose and didn’t fit snugly enough.  Had to return.
New_Balance,2,I have a small foot and I typically wear a size 5.5 or 6. These shoes run super small. I figured I try to even give them to my daughter because she wears a 4 and they even fit her small. Cute shoes. Disappointed. Not sure if I got a defective pair or they just ran that small. And I am scared to swap and just have same issue happen
New_Balance,2,I have lots of size 10 shoes. This is the only one that was too short on my foot
New_Balance,2,I have platform high heels that are more comfortable then these.
New_Balance,2,I have wide feet so it makes it hard to find cute looking sneakers. Based on other reviews I thought these would be perfect. Other non wide shoes are wider than these by the arch. Size is as expected but not comfortable to walk in. Will be returning.
New_Balance,2,I have worn a size 7.5 for over 30 years and owned countless pairs of new balance. I was highly disappointed when they didn't fit. They are a least a size to small.
New_Balance,2,"I kept these for a couple of months before I wrote a review. I loved them initially. However, I will not purchase them again.
They are like slip on shoes. No support. The little bit of “cushion” lasts a few wears.  They have no grip on the bottom. I mopped my tile floors and fell."
New_Balance,2,"I like the looks. They are very light, I ordered a wife and I feel like that's accurate however the 8.5 fits more like a 9.5. I recommend sizing down."
New_Balance,2,"I like the style and weight of the shoe (very light) so much that I bought two pairs in different colors. I wear these maybe three times a week. The tops still look like new, but I haven't had them 3 months, and the sole is peeling off. I work a desk job, so am very disappointed by the shoe failure."
New_Balance,2,"I liked the look of these sneakers, but my usual size did not fit even though other New Balance styles do fit."
New_Balance,2,"I looooove the look of these shoes and was happy to find that Amazon carried them in wide BUT I don’t understand the shape of the insole. No one’s heel looks like that. You can feel the instep edge of the insole and seam with every step. Such a bummer. The toe box is great for someone with wide feet though! Definitely a fashion sneaker, mayyyybe a weightlifting sneaker, but very little support for anything super active."
New_Balance,2,"I love the look of these shoes and they feel breathable and airy when wearing them. However, the middle of the shoe is very wide, making it easy to roll my ankle. Even if tied super tight, I just don’t feel my foot is in there solidly. My feet are on the narrow side, but nothing crazy. The UnderArmour sneakers I had before fit better."
New_Balance,2,"I love the shoes and they are amazing, my only complaint is that after I purchased them the tread on the bottom began peeling off. It’s really
Unfortunate."
New_Balance,2,"I LOVE the shoes themselves, they’re super cute and comfortable. Just very disappointed that after one week of wear only at work the bottom layer of the sole is lifting."
New_Balance,2,"I love these shoes and have purchased my second pair. The first pair lasted about a year with casual wear on walks and hikes during warm months. Unfortunately, the second pair is having some issues. I'm outside of my 30 days, so I can't return them. Just over a month after purchase the inserts are sliding out and bunching up every time I take them on or off. This has created a permanent bump on the insole that makes it uncomfortable to wear. Based on this issue, I wouldn't buy them again."
New_Balance,2,I love these shoes. So comfy! I actually purchased a second pair to wear everyday. I strength train 4 times a week and these have been great!!
New_Balance,2,"I love these sneakers. They are lightweight comfortable and reasonably priced. The only thing I didn't like is that the soles are too slick, they should have more grip."
New_Balance,2,I loved these shoes until this past weekend. Now they have ripped at the seams. Poor quality
New_Balance,2,"I LOVED these shoes when they first arrived. The fit great and they were lightweight.
However, after 3 months of wearing them the heal and around the base of the shoe where the sole is attached started to peel away.
Very disappointing. I really wanted to buy another pair at first but if they’re only going to last me 3 months, I think I’d be better off going with a different brand or style."
New_Balance,2,"I loved these shoes,  so so comfortable but they didn’t hold up well . 3 months old and I already need new shoes!"
New_Balance,2,"I loved these sneakers for a month and then the soles seemed to flatten out and were very unsupportive. The insoles started falling apart almost immediately and the laces never stay tied. They are easy to slip in and out of, which is nice but these didn’t last as long as I hoped they would!"
New_Balance,2,"I loved these sneakers, disappointed that I had to return them. If you have low arches like I do, these sneakers are not for you. The picture shows this product (on the left) and my other NB sneakers (on the right). The difference in the soles is very clear. Again, 2 stars because I really liked these sneakers, but not happy I had to return them."
New_Balance,2,"I need to return, they do not fit. I had to by a larger size. I tak e a 81/2 please I have been I'll not able to get out but to hospit E.R and dr. Can you help me to return they have never been worn o lu to try on. Thank you Tina Lukey"
New_Balance,2,"I never buy shoes online because I really prefer to try them on. In light of world situation though, I figured I'd buy the same brand as my last pair of sneaker and hopefully luck out. Now, I may have just gotten the wrong size but regardless, I think they would have been too narrow for my feet anyways. I tried them on at home and decided I'd just wear them snug but my first time going to run in them, my feet cramped and I had to turn around and walk home. I love the way they look but I'd rather have ugly shoes that don't cramp my feet, if it I had to choose."
New_Balance,2,"I ordered a half size up and it was still a little snug but manageable. However, I was very disappointed because it seemed like the insole was too large for the shoe and it kind of bowed up to wear my foot rubbed on the seam of the insole which was quite annoying. I wore them for 30 minutes in the house and decided it was too annoying of a fit."
New_Balance,2,I ordered a size 10 and they were so tight. For more like a 9 . I wasn't happy at all work them.
New_Balance,2,I ordered a size 7 and I could barely get them on my foot. Too small
New_Balance,2,"I ordered my regular size, 7 wide, but I could barely get my foot into the shoe. I think the style with no separate tongue doesn't allow for much stretching in the shoe."
New_Balance,2,I ordered the pink and black and when I select to view my order it goes to the pink and black but I received an all dark gray shoe which I do not care for. Very disappointed.
New_Balance,2,"I ordered the same size I have worn for years and I couldn't even get it on my foot!! there was no traditional ""tongue"" on the shoe, it was all one piece. I was so upset because I like the new look!"
New_Balance,2,"I ordered these shoes for work and I really wanted to like them. They are too tight, even though I ordered a wide,  and do not provide enough support for me to wear them for 12 hours. I ordered a different pair of shoes for work but I kept these for casual wear."
New_Balance,2,"I own a lot of different athletics shoes for targeted purposes. The purpose of these was to have a lightweight, supportive pair for yoga, weight lifting and general wear around the house. I also use them when I travel since they take up less room in my baggage than a pair of running shoes.

Pros: lightweight, comfortable (at first), stylish and a good price
Cons: the foot bed support broke down after less than one month of light use. Subsequently, the side support went next after 3 months on both shoes (see photo from back view; side view to show the newness of the shoe)

In comparison, I purchased a pair of the NB Arishi V2 foam running shoe which now has about the same use level and the performance is great. I have purchased a second pair of this model."
New_Balance,2,"I own several pairs of these shoes, but the cream/gold ones were smaller than my others. Totally uncomfortable, and I ended up just having to get rid of them. The fabric doesn’t stretch like my others."
New_Balance,2,I purchased the wide width and they definitely are not for wide feet.  I found them to be extremely narrow.  Which makes me sad because they look super cute.
New_Balance,2,"I purchased this pair at the end of February, normal use, and the bottom on one of the shoes is flapping already. I love this style of shoe, I have another pair in black that has lasted more than a year, maybe closer to two and they're still going! Unfortunately, the amount of time to return to Amazon has expired. I'd like to get these replaced, hoping when I reach out directly to New Balance, they'll help me out."
New_Balance,2,I really like these shoes and they fit nicely and slip on easily but they squeak like mad and I find it too annoying to wear them all the time! I can’t even believe this is a problem with New Balance shoes....? Definitely strange and I have no idea how to fix the problem.
New_Balance,2,I really liked the look of this shoe however my feet were a little to wide for them.
New_Balance,2,"I really liked these when I received them. However, the in-soles are coming out after only a month of occasional use. Now the insole has a crease in it due to moving around that makes them uncomfortable and causing blisters. Now I can’t return because it’s been over 30 days."
New_Balance,2,"I really wanted to like this shoe. It’s SO comfortable, but, they’re are terrible for everything except very short walks. They provide zero support. Which defeats the purpose of them being so damn comfortable."
New_Balance,2,"I really wanted to love these sneakers since they're cute and lightweight, but the sizing is just so far off.  I normally wear a 7, but they were too tight so I returned for a 7.5.  Those didn't feel any bigger so I went for an 8W (8 wasn't available in the color combo I wanted).  My toes still touch the front so I'm giving up at this point."
New_Balance,2,"I require good support in my shoes, and these just didn't have enough."
New_Balance,2,I returned these right after I got them. The “toe box” (from your toes back to the first seam) felt like HARD plastic. I only gave them 2 stars because they are cute. Too bad they feel like Tupperware over the top of your foot.
New_Balance,2,I returned this shoe. The memory foam sole just disappears under your weight. It’s like it isn’t there.
New_Balance,2,"I thought I was getting something cute and quick to slip on, soul feels like hard plastic tried walking one on the carpet and feels like they are about to fall apart, sending them back ASAP!"
New_Balance,2,"I trusted the brand, but I was disappointed that these shoes didn’t met my expectations. The shoe is definitely lightweight, but the foot bed had very thin padding, and the soles started to crease. The materials used to make the shoe didn’t hold up to daily walking after a couple of weeks. The shoes are not a terrible fit, but the quality leaves much to be desired."
New_Balance,2,"I used to but New balance does all the time but this is the first pair in years that I've tried and they are very narrow, especially since I ordered the wide size, I tried 2 sizes and ended up sending both back. Normally I'm a 9.5, and I tried both 9.5 wide and 10 wide and my toes were being crushed at the front of the shoe in both sizes"
New_Balance,2,I usually like New Balance but these just don’t hold up well. In less than 6 months they are pretty worn looking. Wouldn’t buy again.
New_Balance,2,"I usually like New Balance, but I found this style disappointing. No arch support."
New_Balance,2,I usually love New Balance and wear an 8.5 wide. I ordered my usual size in these and they were VERY small all around. I've also tried these on in store and they are the same so I think this style just runs small. These were cute but I ultimately decided to return them because they were just so narrow.
New_Balance,2,"I usually wear a 9-9.5 in sneakers, I have 3 pairs of these New Balance in light grey, castlerock, and burgundy. All are a 9.5 all fit pretty much the same. I guess the all black are a different production run or a newer version of the shoe. They fit COMPLETELY different. At first I ordered my usual 9.5 and they were about a half size too small so I returned them and ordered the 10. The 10 fit just like the 9.5 but they are wider. Also, the foam in the right foot was almost non-existent compared to the left. I am extremely disappointed in the all black sneaker :("
New_Balance,2,"I usually wear size 7 in tennis shoes BUT I ordered 7.5 in these.  They are so tight in the front around the toes. Will have to return.
I like how lightweight they are and they look good"
New_Balance,2,I wanted these for work since I’m standing on my feet all day basically. But these were a let down... instead of feeling like $40 shoes they felt like $20 champion shoes. I hate spending so much on shoes so I thought these would be perfect. But they’re more for casual walking and I’d certainly not wear them running.
New_Balance,2,I wanted to like these but couldn’t. I bought them for walking around my neighborhood with my dogs and it turned out disastrously. I ended up with massive blisters on my heels even after breaking them in. There is no padding in the heel so there’s to way to really protect you from the rubbing that happens with walking. They were also very much on the small side which contributed to the blistering.
New_Balance,2,"I was disappointed in the support of this shoe. I regularly buy New Balance for the great arch support and prevention of pronation. This shoe offers neither, so I cannot wear them for my workouts. I do like the look and they are very light weight, so I wear them casually."
New_Balance,2,"I was excited ti get these shoes and was quickly disappointed. I got them in a 9.5 wide due to having a bunion on one foot. When first opening the box, they looked somewhat small. I tried them on and they fit fine. Well, I wore them the next day to work and it was not good. You have to either wear no socks or extremely thin socks for them to not fit too tight. They did not fit like other 9.5 shoes that I have. Even if I got a size 10 I don't believe they would fit better. The shoe says it has memory foam in it, but not enough. After wearing these shoes for 7 hours at work, my entire toenail in my big toe hurts. These will more than likely go in the trash."
New_Balance,2,I was excited to order a 10.5 as that is hard to find in shoes. It fit the same (possibly smaller) than a 10 I have in another pair of new balance shoes.
New_Balance,2,I was expecting more support around the ankle. I had to add step ins to give my feet support
New_Balance,2,I was highly disappointed to unbox and discover the inside of the shoe full of what looks like dog fur! As if someone tried on the shoes with dirty socks with pet hair on them and then returned the shoes before they were sent to me.
New_Balance,2,"I was hoping for a comfortable fit based on all the positive reviews but these shoes are not comfortable on my feet. The back keeps rubbing up on my ankle and has given me blisters. I thought I needed some more time to break the shoes in but it’s not the case. After two weeks of wear, the same discomfort is present. Will be returning these."
New_Balance,2,"I was really disappointed these fell apart so quickly because they were SO comfortable!

Normally I wear Vans or Chuck Taylors but I was going to the UK and knew I'd be doing A LOT of walking (inner city, no crazy hiking or anything), so I wanted something a little more comfortable that I could wear for longer periods of time.

About a month into my trip (and I didn't even wear them every day) the sole split and started to fall off. It was such a bummer. I had to go buy a pair of Vans that are still holding up nicely. :("
New_Balance,2,I was really liking these shoes. I walk all day for work and these shoes were perfect. Very lightweight - almost felt like I wasn't even wearing shoes. But I've had them for only like 2 months now and already have a whole in them.
New_Balance,2,"I was SO excited for these sneakers. I seem to go through sneakers crazy fast as the sole wears right through. I thought I’d give new balance a try now that they are more stylish. I love the color and the style. The fit was perfect for me and they can go with a lot. Fast forward a few weeks and maybe a handful of wears and the finger loop on the back tore right off the top of the back of the shoe. I had my shoes untied when I went to put them on and was pulling lightly to get them over my heel. One little pull and poof. I was SO disappointed. So while I do love these sneakers, I am disappointed in how quickly they are falling apart."
New_Balance,2,I wear 8.5 in pumas but I liked the look of these. Got them yesterday tried it on super narrow and was disappointed to see that the sides of the shoes are super thin mesh that you can see through.
New_Balance,2,I wear a size 9 in my Nikes I wear now. So I ordered the size “9 wide” Bc I’m flat footed and it doesn’t fit with my socks on. It’s not even wide.
New_Balance,2,"I wear normally wear a size 8 shoe so I ordered an 8.5 just to be safe. When my order arrived, I wash surprised that I could barely get my foot inside the shoe. They were so tight there was no way I could have stood much less  walk in these. I’d probably have to order a size 9.5 to get the same fit as my previous ASICS and Nike’s."
New_Balance,2,"I wear size 7...I've never encountered a shoe where I had to size up unless it was a shoe I wanted to wear with really big winter socks. I couldn't even get my feet in these shoes. As for the insole in these, my 3+ year old sneakers that are all worn out have more support and more padding than these. Very disappointed in these..."
New_Balance,2,"I’m a culinary student and I stand on my feet all day, bought these for school thinking they would last a long time. By the end of the first month the memory foam padding was shot and I had to inserts to help, and by the end of the sem two holes on each foot started on the top of the seem on the shoes. Wouldn’t recommend for everyday use"
New_Balance,2,I’m a size 7 women’s shoes and my daughter is somewhere between 7 and 7.5. Bought these in a 7.5  for her. She tried them and said they were too small so I thought I’d try them... wow... these fit more like a 6.5.  They run very small!
New_Balance,2,"I’m not sure who these shoes are made for. If you’re on your feet at all, then these shoes are certainly not for you. I work on my feet all day, and by the end of the first week of wear, my whole body was aching.

The fit is quite comfortable. But order a size up. For whatever reason, the sole is SUPER narrow.

If you need these shoes for more of a fashion statement — like to pair with yoga pants when you go out for brunch, then hey, these are perfect. But if you need athletic shoes for doing things like... you know.... walking or standing, then find another shoe."
New_Balance,2,"I’ve been buying NB for too many years to count! This is the first time that I’ve been disappointed, so I’m returning them. They’re great looking shoes, but they don’t have the support NB has always had."
New_Balance,2,I’ve had these shows for little over a month and the inside is tearing. I’ve had Nikes for over 5 years and these shoes can’t last a month? They’re extremely comfortable to stand in. But I would not buy again due to the inside is falling apart.
New_Balance,2,"I’ve ordered this shoe twice... with two returns. The first was my original size of 8.5, but waaay to small. The second was a 9 and also too small. So sizing is off a full size? The second pair came with cat hair all over inside. I had to lint roll them before even trying them on. I wish I had taken a picture before returning. Gross."
New_Balance,2,Idk sized up since 8.5 was a little snug but after wearing for a day they were just loose altogether so it doesn't feel comfortable plus they kind of look like a really dark blue in certain areas I thought I'd love them but they just aren't what I was hoping for
New_Balance,2,"If it's important to you to have rubber soles for traction, this is not the shoe for you. This is the reason I chose this pair. However the soles are man-made, not rubber. Other than this error in description, shoes are cute and comfortable."
New_Balance,2,"If they don't fit you (I got the right size, but they're too wide)...there isn't much way to tighten them.  I usually love New Balance, but these weren't for me.  Same quality I would always expect, and arrived quickly."
New_Balance,2,If you are in the food industry I would look elsewhere. Not once but twice I fell on a slick floor. I have used for a couple of weeks so wont return but wont but again
New_Balance,2,If you have wide feet do not purchase they absolutely are not the width they’re supposed to be.
New_Balance,2,"If your ankles are at all weak, or if you don't want them to eventually be, avoid this shoe!

As you can see in the pictures, the entire shoe curves inward, on both shoes. This combined with no arch support leaves ankles at risk for rolling and leaves arches collapsed and ankles sagging inward.

The box of the shoe (toes) is not wide; the heel area is not wide. The only area I would consider wide is the widest area of the shoe which is only slightly wider than normal.

The stretch is okay. The materials are decent. There was no cheap chemical smell when opening. But all in all, these are a bad shoe that will leave people aching feet, ankles, knees, and backs!"
New_Balance,2,"I'm a 9 1/2. My toes went right up to the end. Usually a 9 1/2 gives me a bit of toe room, but not in these ones. It was bad enough where I'm considering exchanging them. Also, the pad inside causes my feet to fall inward, which makes me feel unstable. The pad in one shoe was also shorter than the other."
New_Balance,2,I'm a size 6. I've never had to size up or down before. These were too tight on my toes. They run small.
New_Balance,2,Im usually a size 9 wide. To be safe i got a 9.5wide and it was still too small. Lame
New_Balance,2,"Incredibly cheap, no support. Would be okay if I’d bought them at Payless for like $18, but they’re not even sort of supportive. Bought them as a work shoe (I’m a waitress) and after wearing them once my legs and feet hurt SO BAD. Figured I just needed to break them in, but they’re just cheap material and flimsy. Cute if you’re just wearing them around, but only buy for looks, not utility!"
New_Balance,2,Insane how small these run. I bought a full size up and couldn’t even fit my foot in them.
New_Balance,2,It feels like I have put my foot in someone else’s shoe - a well worn shoe that someone else’s foot molded into their footprint. I’m hoping they’ll get better after wearing them (a lot) but right now they don’t feel comfortable.
New_Balance,2,it has very cushion and my step seems to be going inward.  my feet almost seem to be touching the floor.
New_Balance,2,"It is a nice looking shoe. However, there is not very much support and for the price, I thought there would at least be some cushion. I would not recommend as a walking shoe."
New_Balance,2,It was too small. It’s really cute and I think it would be comfortable with the right size.
New_Balance,2,Its a ok shoe. Not what I expected. Not at lot support.
New_Balance,2,I've bought many New Balance sneakers in many styles in the same size but this shoe was different than anything I've ever bought.  Too small and not nearly wide enough for what they claim is 7 wide.  It's had nice material and well made though.
New_Balance,2,"I've purchased this sneaker for comfort, I had the same one in different colors, unfortunately it runs a bit small, If you have wide feet get a half a size bigger.. Other then that it's nice for walking, 👟"
New_Balance,2,"I've worn these as casual shoes, and to work a few times, but the heel loop ripped within the first week and I don't expect these to last very long with regular use. Not a bad light-use sneaker, but I wouldn't purchase these if you are wanting something durable/dependable."
New_Balance,2,Just a weird fit all around.  I always wear a 6.5 wide in NB shoes.  I got my normal size and had to return them because my toes were to the top.  Got a 7 wide and they were weirdly baggy?!?  Like when I tied them the fabric folded.  Sad to return.  I usually love my NB shoes.
New_Balance,2,Labeled size 10 and was clearly not a 10!! My foot barely fit! Never have I had this problem with purchasing shoes. Which makes me think the seller knew this and still sold the product. Then I get stuck with the $13 shipping return. Returning label was super small and a pain to make work as well. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing from this company.
New_Balance,2,"Left shoe fits as expected,  but right is tight in the toe box. They're ok for a couple of hours, but not all day or walking long distance."
New_Balance,2,"Let me start off by saying that I loved this shoe for weeks. I work 12 hour shifts in healthcare at a children’s hospital and I’m always up and walking around, so I thought that these would be a nice lightweight and comfortable shoe to wear. It started out with leg pain here and there but nothing crazy.

Then I worked 3 days in a row, which turned out to be a huge mistake. By the end of the second shift walking to my car and starting into my third shift my foot had oddly started hurting and increasingly grew to the point where I could no longer walk on it. Then on the drive home I started feeling slight back pain and by the time I got home I could hardly walk properly without feeling pain in my back and left foot.

I would NOT recommend this shoe to anyone who does a lot of walking in their job or stands for hours. I would however recommend this shoe as a day to day choice for running errands as it is super cute and light weight.

I would also recommend sizing up by at least half a size if not a whole size like I had to do."
New_Balance,2,"Lightweight and comfy. I did order half size up, they were tight if I didn't."
New_Balance,2,Like the slip on style but the shoe runs small and has little support.
New_Balance,2,"Live the look but run very small.  Ordered a wide and it was tight.  Tighter than a medium normally is.  Also, too short.  If I get a wide I can generally get a half size smaller.  Again.  Much shorter than my regular size!"
New_Balance,2,"Love the color and look...hate the sizing. I’m a die-hard New Balance wearer, specifically running shoes. Apparently their sizing is drastically different between styles. I originally ordered a 9.5 (based on my running shoes) and they were too loose in toes and around my foot in general. I ordered a size 9, hoping they’d be perfect...nope. Too tight around my toes. I guess I need a 9.25. I am returning both, realizing that with either size, I’d not be 100% comfortable, and likely not wear them much, if at all. Also, I didn’t realize how low the shoe around the ankle would be...showing off a lot of low cut sock, if you plan to wear any, as I did. These shoes would probably work without socks too, if you can find the right size for you."
New_Balance,2,"Loved the comfort and flexibility, the fact they are slip-on. Unfortunately you have to have a wider foot, at least around the ankles/heel, to be able to wear them. You can’t really adjust the laces without making the top and “tongue” buckle, and the laces don’t go up high enough to compensate for a narrower ankle/heel. A smaller size only made my toes rub the end with the same gaps in the back."
New_Balance,2,"Loved the look, but they run 1/2-1 size too small. Had to return. The next 2 sizes up were not available in this shoe."
New_Balance,2,"ME AGRADA QUE ES LIVIANO
NO ME AGRADA QUE NO TIENE EL SOPORTE NECESARIO PARA UN CALZADO DEPORTIVO.
NO SE VE DE CALIDAD, PARECE IMITACION"
New_Balance,2,Much smaller then normal sizes. Can’t wear them bc too tight and hurt my feet.
New_Balance,2,"muy pequeño, soy 6.5 y me quedan que no los puedo usar, corren pequeños si lo vas a pedir pidelo 1 size mas grande"
New_Balance,2,My feet hurt and they run small. My toes are squished. I have a sprained ankle and my doc recommended high arch and this isn’t it
New_Balance,2,Never seen shoes that the sizing is THAT OFF***. I wear size 7/7.5; I ordered size 7.5 - I opened the box and looked like kids shoes? The 7.5 looks like size 5. Returning them.
New_Balance,2,New Balance is known for it's width but I purchased the shoe for the reviews of it's superior arch support.  I'm extremely disappointed because I have several pair with superior support.
New_Balance,2,Nice but 7 wide fits like an 8 ...way too big. Should have gotten a 6.5 wide
New_Balance,2,Nice design. Not a ton of support. Runs small...
New_Balance,2,Nice looking shoe...just not true to the size or width...Returned them.
New_Balance,2,"Nice shoe but run very small and inside very rough, scratches on toes..a must wear socks.."
New_Balance,2,Nice shoe width not very good support for nurses walking and standing.
New_Balance,2,Nice sneaker but order a size up . Very tight around the toes
New_Balance,2,No arch support and my heel falls inward when I step. I had to order inserts. Also I ordered wide and they seem tight.
New_Balance,2,"No support, no arch, too small. Look nice but really stiff and not comfortable. Cant imagine wearing these to walk, work, or excercise."
New_Balance,2,No support. Had to purchase insoles for arch and heel support. Started noticing after wearing knees hurt. Shows does not have the heel support for proper alignment of heels.
New_Balance,2,"Normally like New Balance, but these had absolutely no arch support, felt flimsy and offered no lateral stability. I would compare them to a Sketchers Go Walk. Would probably have been ok for lounging around the house, but no way I good do any distance walking in these. I returned them."
New_Balance,2,Not a good fit for me.  Couldn't feel any support. Not what I expected from New Balance.
New_Balance,2,Not a good shoe for support. This shoe has my feet aching and it forces my feet to go inward. I thought I had to get used to them but it's not working out.  I have to send them back.
New_Balance,2,Not a very comfortable shoe for a long time
New_Balance,2,Not comfortable
New_Balance,2,Not comfy
New_Balance,2,"not enough support in the bottoms, had to buy inserts"
New_Balance,2,Not for nursing!  Went back to an old pair of shoes.
New_Balance,2,Not for on you feet working.
New_Balance,2,Not for wide feet.
New_Balance,2,Not good arch support!!! and runs a little small....
New_Balance,2,Not true to size
New_Balance,2,Not true to size. I am usually a 6 regular. I ordered a 6 wide. The shoe was just wide enough to be comfortable but not wide at all. Also a size 6 leaves room for my toes and this shoe did not. My small toes were right up to the front edge. I am returning these shoes. Well I missed the window so now I’m stuck with shoes that don’t fit and are unworn.
New_Balance,2,Not true to size. I wear an 8 w and it's way too small for 8
New_Balance,2,Not wide enough in toe area; back of shoe slips up and down and rubs on heel
New_Balance,2,"Note the number of reviews that mention the lack of support. These shoes feel very loose, and flimsy. I have a pair of NB Fresh Foam sneakers that I have literally walked the bottoms off of (hence why I replaced them with these). Definitely not an equally comfortable shoe. The back rubbed my ankle raw, and my feet ached after minimal walking. Super bummed bc they’re cute and the price was awesome... but with walking all day for work, they will be returned and replaced with something with more support and comfort."
New_Balance,2,On Amazon Prime day we purchased this pair on women’s New Balance shoes for $62.42 at what was supposed to be 50% off. When they arrived the shoes had a Marshall’s sales tag attached that said the were on sale for $39.99 from regular price of $80. The shoes were too small so we returned and got a refund but still we could have gotten ripped off big time!
New_Balance,2,Only worn them 3 times and the insole is already worn down.
New_Balance,2,Order 2 sizes larger then you need.  Very cute but had to return
New_Balance,2,"Order a half size up. Wanted to give 5 starts but today is second day i wore them and right shoe back hoop brook at gym. Otherwise really like. Can I get replacement shoe,  right.?"
New_Balance,2,"Order half a size larger. The memory sole is soft, but there's not much arch support."
New_Balance,2,"Ordered these in a women’s size 8. I wear a size 8 in ANY kind of shoe. I was absolutely disappointed that these were actually too small. Every part of the shoe fit, but the tips of my toes actually were rubbing the inside of the toe of the shoe! These are strangely short in the toe area. Did not return."
New_Balance,2,"Ordered wide width , extremely snug nice on but would stretch out in a matter of weeks. Back in the box to Amazon and they are off!!"
New_Balance,2,"Ordering sneakers first time in online, I am disappointed in this product. It is far too small and tight as well as flimsy. Even though I bought it on sale, it was not cheap. Feel like a total waste of my money."
New_Balance,2,"Outside of shoe was new but when I went to try on I noticed the sole insert in both shoes was covered front to back in what appears to be dog hair! It was not anywhere else on the inside of the shoe, but as you can see the sole inserts were gross!"
New_Balance,2,Perfect fit and comfortable!
New_Balance,2,"Pretty disappointed.
Not in the shoe- but because someone had very clearly worn them and returned them.
They don’t smell good, and tons of Marks & dirt spots."
New_Balance,2,Purchased these to walk in around the neighborhood and to do gym workout (weights).  They are very mushy! Ok for walking on the treadmill and doing weights. Not good for walking around outside! They provide no support! You can also feel the road in these. Very disappointed. I walked 4 miles and was miserable the entire time! Never walk in these again! Will only do weights or walk around the house!
New_Balance,2,"Quizás el error fue mio, pedí la talla que uso habitualmente y me quedan completos no puedo usarlos con calcetas, ni para entrenar, se sienten muy cómodos pero no los puedo usar quedan muy ajustados"
New_Balance,2,Ran small not supportive.  Ended up returning them
New_Balance,2,Really liked these when I first received them but it took my feet a few weeks to get adjusted to them. And now they are falling apart on the soles. Expected them to hold up better being New Balance!
New_Balance,2,Replaced my old New Balance with these. Perfect fit and light weight. Will buy again.
New_Balance,2,Returning this shoe.  It's not very comfortable at all.  I expected the heal to be cushiony but it was definitely underwhelming.  I ordered half size up as recommended and that too was a mistake.  Zero arch support in this shoe.  What can I say?  Ordering shoes online is very hard to do.  I like to try before I buy.
New_Balance,2,Run small and fit awkwardly
New_Balance,2,Runs a size too small
New_Balance,2,Runs small
New_Balance,2,Runs small and I even purchased wide to help accommodate but still was to narrow.
New_Balance,2,"Runs small. Even without socks, these are small. I’m a true 7.5 but these are about 1 whole size smaller, at least. They would have been great otherwise."
New_Balance,2,"Shoe fits exactly as expected, however I’ve had to get insoles right out of the bat and my feet still kill me and I zombie shuffle at the end of the day.  I work retail and am on my feet 10 hours a day and these were one of the top rated for that."
New_Balance,2,Shoe laces are always coming out of double knots because they are too smooth.  The shoe itself is much lighter than I expected... that part is comfortable and feels like you are wearing socks when sitting down.  Zero arch support and my feet hurt on day one just walking around.
New_Balance,2,Shoe sole is not slip resistant as it says it is. The sizes run small. And wider than expected. It doesn’t tie very tight therefore it constantly feels too loose.
New_Balance,2,"Shoes are a nice style however my mother wears a size 7.5.  We ordered 2 pairs of new balance (Christmas), in 2 styles.  One fit, this pair her toe hit the front.  Not a little off, A LOT.  When I went to return they tried to take over $30 off of my credit for the return!  ALL of my mothers shoes are 7.5, even the other new balance pair.  We had to get these in an 8.  As far as ""wide,"" not much different than the regular."
New_Balance,2,"Shoes hurt my feet after 5/6 hours being on them.  :(
I need a good pair of shoes for work was hoping these would work ."
New_Balance,2,Should have gotten a bigger size toe hits the top
New_Balance,2,Show broke down VERY fast... no support at all within a month.... did not wear very often. The show just didnt hold up.
New_Balance,2,Size up - for sure!
New_Balance,2,"So cute!! But had to return. The ordering was confusing— sizes are listed in M and W. My feet are little, I swim in wide shoes. So I ordered “M” — but wide shoes were shipped anyways. I don’t know what M stands for, but I was betting that “W” stood for wide.  If you have small feet, make sure you find clarification before ordering. If I knew I’d be sent regular size shoes, I’d place a new order because they look great."
New_Balance,2,"So disappointed that these weren't a better fit for me. The cushion feels so nice but they are super narrow and have no arch support. After a weekend of shifts on my feet, I ended up with terrible foot pain that had me at the Drs. Had to stop wearing them."
New_Balance,2,"So disappointed. Ordered wide. Received regular width. The box said they were wide. I wore them for a day trying to break them in. Then notice they were reg width. They hurt my feet terrible. These shoes turned in my ankles (pronation). I thought it was all in my head until my husband asked me what was wrong with my feet. The laces are decorative. They don't add support. The toe box has plenty of room. I can feel my heel sliding left to right. I love new balance but I was really disappointed. The memory foam is soft, but trapped the heat in. I tried wearing with out socks, still kill my feet"
New_Balance,2,"So incredibly disappointed. Very comfortable and would have been a great walking shoe, but they started to fall apart after only wearing them indoors for the morning. What a bummer."
New_Balance,2,Strange itchy bug bite marks on my heels after wearing them. Hope they don’t have mites or bed bugs!
New_Balance,2,"Su puntería es perfecta, su ancho es demasiado grande y el soporte del arco  es poco confortable."
New_Balance,2,"Súper confortable, but zero support. Honestly not a fan, the color isn’t a true black either."
New_Balance,2,Supposed to be wide width. Couldn’t get my foot in it.
New_Balance,2,The bottom is too thin defiantly not for running
New_Balance,2,"The first time I ordered these they sent a wide in error. I then had to wait a couple months for the correct size to be in stock. The medium were a bit wide but decided to keep them anyway. In the two months I’ve had them, the material on the inside toe area has worn out so I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before the hole will go all the way through. Very disappointed in the quality, however they were comfortable."
New_Balance,2,"The fit is too flat from heel to toe.  Usually New Balance has a ""combination last"" which this shoe does not."
New_Balance,2,"The forefoot fit fine but the heel area has a low and non-supportive heel. When I tried to do exercises that required balancing movements I found I had no stability. Plan to use it around the house as it is comfortable, but definitely not for exercising."
New_Balance,2,The gold started peeling off after two wears. It’s got a tan ace bandage underneath. It’s not cute
New_Balance,2,"The grey material does not allow for flexing so was too small, I own the exact pair in maroon and fits true to size."
New_Balance,2,"The look is cool but the functionality of the shoe is not as described.
It's a cute shoe if you're hanging out or going shopping but it has no support. I usually wear a regular width shoe but the fit of this is extremely tight."
New_Balance,2,"The low support and thin mesh fabric allowed for the foot to roll quite a bit within the shoe, causing soreness. Would not recommend for use during long periods of standing and walking."
New_Balance,2,The memory foam in this shoe doesn’t even cover the whole width of the shoe. The corner of it digs into the middle of my foot. This design makes absolutely no sense. It hurts when I’m walking.
New_Balance,2,"The photos were misleading- I selected the one of black & pink shoes and instead got the all black ones. But that didn’t matter because they were way too small, so I returned. I went to a store afterwards and tried on this brand just because I was curious, and I ended up having to go 1 1/2 sizes up from my regular size!"
New_Balance,2,"The product had a ""wide"" label and tag; however, they do not fit my wide foot well at all. There were no return labels WIDE?or return materials included so I kept them. Maybe I'll eventually be able to wear them out but for now I can only put them on to wear around the house."
New_Balance,2,The reviews are right when they say these shoes are comfortable and lightweight but for $50+???? They feel cheap for that price and already feel like they won’t last long as many reviews warned. Considering returning them. Not worth the $$
New_Balance,2,The rubber sole split on the sides after a couple of months.  I do not see an option to return these so I am very disappointed.
New_Balance,2,"The shoe had a few defects including visible glue, and shoe strings were odd one side had rounded tips and the other had flat tips. The packaging looked counterfeit, Im sure it was the seller and not the brand as I have gotten NB in the past and this is the first time I questioned the quality of the shoe. Comparing my shoe to other shoes in the reviews I felt like there shoes and packaging varied. The fabric used did not feel appropriate for foot wear I know if I used them they would've been torn rather quickly. Im sure if you just want shoes that are for home these might work but everyday wear you may not like how loose the shoes are, at least this specific type and be weary of what sellers you select."
New_Balance,2,The shoe had no padding was very comfortable and felt like I was just standing on the floor with no support on the foot
New_Balance,2,The shoe was very hard to get on and during the course of the day caused my feet to swell and ache. I wore them once. They were suppose to be wide but weren't and were not giving at all. Waste of hard earned dollars.
New_Balance,2,The sneaker did not fit right. We sent them back. The return process was flawless received credit in 3 days! That's great!
New_Balance,2,"The sneakers fit great and look just as pictured but, unfortunately have broken at the seems after only wearing them for a few weeks. I looked down at my feet to see a large 1.5 inch rip at the seam so my foot is exposed. I know I did not do anything that would have caused this.  Where is New Balance quality? Pretty disappointed because they are indeed comfortable."
New_Balance,2,The sole of the shoe is much thinner than depicted in the picture! I need a good shoe for work but these are not good for standing and walking for 8 hours! Not happy
New_Balance,2,"The toes are quite tight and there isn't much support on the sides of the shoe. They definitely aren't worth the money. Kind of flimsy. I just needed something now thats the only reason I'm keeping them. The box from the seller arrived LIKE THIS! I get it, things are busy, but like clearly someone ran over it or stepped on it. Even the tissue paper was shredded inside. I'm disappointed that I spent the money on these. At least the back heel is supportive besides that, skip it."
New_Balance,2,The top of the shoe (mid foot and toes) is wide by the back of the shoe (near the heel) is waaaay too narrow. I ordered an 11w. The material feels extremely cheap and I don’t think they will hold up. They’re not as attractive on the foot as they are in the picture.
New_Balance,2,"There are not bad looking, However, they do not  have much support specially in the front of the shoe box and the heel. I had to add another sole in order to have some support, but still does not feel comfortable, i felt like I was walking without shoes, if you add more soles then there would not  be room for your foot."
New_Balance,2,There is no arch support.
New_Balance,2,There was no support and the loop on the back broke when I pulled it to try them on. They've been returned.
New_Balance,2,These are actually great shoes. They can skip on easy. I wish I had gotten a half size bigger. Also after 1week and 4 jogs the sole started snapping with every walk. I will be returning these and getting something different.... sadly
New_Balance,2,"These are cute, but are way too small. I’m an 8.5, and usually buy 9 in sneakers to account for socks. I ordered a 9 and they feel like I put on a 7.5. Also, they are advertised as athletic shoes, but they are way too soft and thin to provide support for working out."
New_Balance,2,"These are essentially like a pair of Keds sneakers - they are not cross trainers.  They have very little support and are only appropriate for very low impact activities.  I would not even recommend for a long walk.  The fit also seems a bit off - narrower than I expected and I do not have wide feet.  So disappointed, they look super cute and the materials seem to be wearing well - those are the only things they have going for them."
New_Balance,2,These are my second pair ordered and filled both with Amazon. They are not the same size as the last pair which fit great! These are not true wide width Shoes. Disappointed!
New_Balance,2,These are not as comfortable as advertised quite disappointed
New_Balance,2,"These are really cute shoes and comfortable. I ordered two pairs, one in black and one in grey. However, BOTH shoes started squeaking/clicking when I walk. The grey pair started about one month after I got them and the black pair started about 4 months after I got them. The noise is so loud and distracting and also embarrassing, since it can be heard by everyone else. I had to get rid of the shoes. Would not buy these again and wouldn't recommend them."
New_Balance,2,"These are really cute, but I have my doubts whether they are true new balance shoes or fakes... the bottoms don’t seem to be rubber.  I’m slipping around on concrete like there’s grease on the bottom of the shoes.  Definitely not safe for any activity."
New_Balance,2,These are the best shoes BUT this pair I just received were made way too small!! They definitely weren’t made TTS. So I had to order a size up and I’m hoping they fit. I’ll update once I receive them!!
New_Balance,2,"These are very narrow for a wide and the toe box is small. I didn't realize the tongue is attached, so you can't loosen the laces to make them looser. It's all one piece. They are cute, though. I really wish they were wide."
New_Balance,2,These claim that are non slip shoes but I used them to work in a restaurant environment and I was definitely slipping a the time. I had to be very careful when I walked on wet floors s.
New_Balance,2,"These didn’t have much arch support, so unfortunately I had to send them back.  I did like how nice they looked on my feet tho.  Just a bit too flat for me."
New_Balance,2,"These might work for running errands, but they certainly won't cut it for my work-outs. I'll have to return at my own cost since it's a third party seller.

Pros
Cute, sleek look
Comfortable

Cons
Zero lateral support - NONE! (the sides are completely flexible and literally flop over)
Runs at least a half size small"
New_Balance,2,"These New Balances are really sharp looking and slid on well... they were very slim (maybe I need a wide? Have never needed wide before) and my toes reached the very end of these sneakers, so they were a bit small for my 9.5 womens usual standard fit. I also felt they did not have any arch support, but that could be because my arches were off the soles! lol! If you order a half size up and have very skinny feet, I bet these are a great match!"
New_Balance,2,These Niggas looks so much better on line the night in person. I’ve only wore them once. For some reason I feel like they should be on a much older woman. I do not like the way they fit or lock. The pink it’s very  light.
New_Balance,2,"These run very small and narrow. I returned my first pair and ordered a whole size larger. They were still too small. The length and uppers fit well, but the inside of the shoe felt incredibly narrow. The edge of the insole was pressing into my arch. Don't want to chance ordering a third pair, I'll try a different style or brand. I'm disappointed because the rest of the shoe is really comfortable."
New_Balance,2,These shoes are adorable. Got lots of compliments but they fell apart after a couple of months of casual wear.  I would not purchase again.
New_Balance,2,"These shoes are for a child. I ordered size 7.5 and got something that's 2 inches shorter than my Nike's 7.5. The shoes are really light otherwise and had they been the right length for the expected size, they may have been perfect. I wonder what makes the sizing so off! I gave it 2 stars for the feel in my hands and the looks that I like. Now I don't trust even a replacement size... what size is the right size?"
New_Balance,2,These shoes are not true to size. They feel about a half size too small.
New_Balance,2,"These shoes are so cute, but sadly they are way too narrow. Normally New Balance seems so run wide, like my feet, so a couple of months back I had purchased these in grey. I mostly just wore them to work at first and didn’t notice anything, but after walking around in them for long periods of time my feet would hurt a little. Then, after running in them my feet got blistered where the insole meets the inner side wall of the shoe because of how narrow the insole was. By this point I’d worn the shoes too many times to return/exchange them so I bought them in a wide size... even in a wide size the insole was WAY too narrow for my foot. I didn’t get a chance to run or even really walk around in the wides because I’m returning them. I could feel the meeting point between sidewall and insole slightly pinching the sole of my foot just from trying them on. It should be noted my feet run a bit wide but I’ve never really needed to purchase a wide size shoe before :( so bummed out because I love the look and feel of these shoes.

Bottom line, if you have a very narrow foot these shoes will be awesome! If you have feet that even run the slightest bit wide, JUST SAY NO."
New_Balance,2,"These shoes are super cute, however, they are very poorly made.  There is absolutely no support at all.  I experienced severe ankle and leg pain after wearing them for more than an hour.  I bought them hoping they would be a good work out shoe, however, due to lack of ankle and arch support, I tried them as just an everyday casual shoe, but that didn't work out either because after walking in them for several hours and several occasions, my ankles and my calves hurt so bad, I could barely move the next day.  I definitely do not recommend these shoes!!"
New_Balance,2,"These shoes are very cute but run VERY small. I wear a 6.5, sometimes a 7. My foot will barely go in the size 7 of this shoe. I’d recommend a whole size - maybe even 1.5 size larger than your normal."
New_Balance,2,"These shoes came up in a search for walking shoes. They have a 'memory' foam insert, no support. With that logic all footwear could be classified as walking shoes."
New_Balance,2,"These shoes had NO support at all.  I would have been better off going barefoot.  Cute style, but didn’t outweigh the complete lack of support."
New_Balance,2,"These shoes have worked fine for what they are. However, there is absolutely no support in them. They hurt my feet like crazy. I ended up buying some nice shoe insoles and replacing the ones in the shoes. That made it more tolerable. But know if you’re looking for comfort and support, these shoes are not it!"
New_Balance,2,"These shoes hit the arch of my foot in an uncomfortable place. Unfortunately, I did return them. I bought them on the recommendation of a friend who loves her pair. However they just did not fit my foot comfortably. I also had to size up a half size."
New_Balance,2,These shoes look great but have little no to arch support and more importantly NO TRACTION. I was on wet pavement and was slipping and couldn’t grip the sidewalk while walking. Beware: cute but dangerous. Also run slightly small.
New_Balance,2,"These shoes looked like they would be cool, comfortable summer sneakers. I ordered my usual New Balance size of 8½ Wide. The toe box was snug and the length was about a half-size too short. I actually checked the inside tag to confirm that I had received the size that I ordered. I've always enjoyed the roomy toe box in NB shoes, but these were a real letdown. They also don't have much in the way of arch support. I returned them."
New_Balance,2,These shoes looked so comfortable but they run extremely small so unfortunately I had to return.
New_Balance,2,"These shoes run at least a half size small. You should definitely size up, especially if you’re going to wear socks."
New_Balance,2,"These shoes run small so get at least a size bigger than you normal size. They are ok to wear around the house, but do not provide enough support and comfort to wear to work or workout. My feet were killing me the first time I wore them to work all day."
New_Balance,2,"These shoes were flimsy and unsupportive, but somewhat comfortable. My main issue is that if I went for a walk and the road was even slightly wet, it would quickly soak through the bottom of the shoes and by the time I got back inside my feet and socks were completely soaked. I haven't experienced this with any of my other tennis shoes. I unfortunately ended up throwing these away a couple months after I got them because of this."
New_Balance,2,"These shoes were too wide.  Normally wear a size 8. My feet slid around and the laces don't tighten up like I thought they would.
The bottom sole also felt uneven."
New_Balance,2,"These sneakers look great, but if you need some arch support, these are lacking. I cannot wear very flat shoes.

After a couple of hours of walking in them, my feet hurt. I've never had this happen with running shoes."
New_Balance,2,"These tennis are super cute & that's why they get the 2 stars but they're VERY uncomfortable, they are definitely NOT workout shoe. I thought New Balance tennis were all supposed to be super comfortable & supportive, sadly these are not. I'm wondering if these are counterfeit?! I bought to wear to the gym but I feel that they are too loose even when double knotting the laces, my foot feels like it wants to slip out when doing lunges at the gym. I bought the right size but shoe may be a bit wide? I can't quite pin point the problem other than them not being comfortable There's not much support inside either, the cushion is low to the ground & while wearing these my feet sort of feel like I'm wearing the left shoe on the right foot & vice versa. I've never had this experience with any other tennis shoes & that's why I wonder if they're counterfeit. I really had high expectations for these shoes especially since they weren't cheap. I wish I could return them but can't sadly because I've worn them a couple of times I don't believe I can. I'd only buy if you're only going to wear on occasion & not to workout in or if you're going to be doing a lot of walking."
New_Balance,2,These were terrible.  There's absolutely no give in the shoe and it runs very narrow and tight for a casual shoe. I missed the return window so I gave my size 10 to someone who wears a size 8. That says it all.
New_Balance,2,They are nice looking but no support. I will donate instead of wearing.
New_Balance,2,"They are so narrow through the middle part of the foot, you end up walking on the side of the shoe."
New_Balance,2,They are too small and aren’t as comfortable as I thought they would be. Not much arch support as I thought there would be either! I won’t waste your money ordering this!
New_Balance,2,They did not have near the support I was looking for and they were too light in weight. Didn’t think they would last long. Sorry.
New_Balance,2,"They didn’t last, sole is coming out, wear showing up...even when I haven’t use them that much."
New_Balance,2,They looked nice but did not fit had to return.
New_Balance,2,They offer no support at all.  Will not use for walking or any long distances.
New_Balance,2,They run small
New_Balance,2,They wear extraordinary fast........ fit was good. They are comfortable
New_Balance,2,"They were listed as ""Narrow"" but when they came they were ""B"" width. Not really New Balance's fault. But I had to return and them and there were no Narrows to be bought. As a person with a narrow foot, I wish more companies would make Narrow shoes, especially in colors other than black, and white!"
New_Balance,2,This is a slip on shoe with laces. For someone with a high instep it is hard to put on.
New_Balance,2,"This product is not TTS in my opinion. It didn’t fit like a standard 11, and the heel was not wide at all. If you’re looking for a wide shoe, this one isn’t it."
New_Balance,2,This shoe definitely runs small and has a toe box than is narrower and shallower than most New Balance. Even the half size larger was not comfortable. The shoes are well padded but have very little support and my feet tended to over pronate when I was wearing them. Not up to NB's usual standards
New_Balance,2,This shoe has NO cushion and NO support. I ordered a wide and it's too wide - the whole shoe is too loose. I will not buy athletic shoes without trying them on first!
New_Balance,2,This shoe is 1 to 1 1/2 sizes to small.  I wear size 6.5 and this fit like a size 5 shoe.  I can't believe how small (short) it was!  It must be mis-marked.  RETURNED.
New_Balance,2,"This shoe is comfortable because there is nothing to it.  There is no lateral support at all. The sides are thin as paper and have no structure. Would be very easy to turn an ankle in these shoes.
They look good and are light but there is more support in a flipflop"
New_Balance,2,This shoe runs way too small! I wear a 7.5 and I’m having to order a 9. This will be the second time I have sent this shoe back! And pay attention to the description bc this same picture for this shoe is on another shoe which is wrong.
New_Balance,2,"This shoe was smaller than expected, I would recommend purchasing a half size bigger. Looks great with all on my outfits, would not recommend wearing this shoe to work if you're standing on your feet constantly due to the lack of support."
New_Balance,2,"This tennis shoes are decent and comfortable, but the inside seem that rests on the top of the foot where the laces are placed is very uncomfortable to the point where these could never be worn without socks. The inner sole began twisting and coming apart from the shoe after the second time worn. For the brand and the cost I am very disappointed."
New_Balance,2,"To be honest  I was a tad bit disappointed in these shoes. I have some fussy feet and need heal and arch support and reading the reviews they said it was pretty good. I have gone on a few walks with these shoes and they're not as comfortable as I was hoping.  Ill still keep them totuna few errands here and there, but don't plan on wearing these for long walks. Or even to Disneyland."
New_Balance,2,"To loose for me, wish they were more fitted, especially with the laces not being very functional."
New_Balance,2,To small.  Not a true 6 1/2
New_Balance,2,To small. Order a 1/2 bigger
New_Balance,2,Too narrow arch seems surportive
New_Balance,2,Too narrow. I ordered a wide width.
New_Balance,2,Too small and too late to return since I opened them after return date
New_Balance,2,Too tight and not supportive.
New_Balance,2,Too tight... returned.
New_Balance,2,"Update: these did not last long, one shoe actually started squeaking shortly after I bought them. One wear and they look dirty. I work in a hospital laboratory so it’s weird how they get so dirty so quick."
New_Balance,2,"Very comfortable shoe. The fabric will be very cool in summer. The fabric will not provide protection or keep the rain out.

Bought in mid-Jan 2021.  Walking 50+ minutes on sidewalk several days per week. Found hole in one insole April 21, 2021. I always wear socks."
New_Balance,2,"Very cute and breathable, but unfortunately zero support. I had double foot surgery and these are probably one of new balances worst shoes for support and comfort. It's the only brand I buy so I was pretty disappointed."
New_Balance,2,Very cute NB shoe with leopard on heel .  Runs half size small and slightly narrow.  Amzn prime members beware - amzn is changing return choices and trying to coerce into exchanges instead of refund - they put refund choice way at bottom.  Disgusting since they don't pay warehouse workers enough and Bezos is already a gazillionair along with his exec staff.
New_Balance,2,Very dissatisfied at the fact that they were so narrow . I never wear wide but I must need one now ? Also sad that the same shoe in wide width is over $20 more ? That to me is absolutely insane ! So I guess I won’t be reordering these and will look elsewhere.
New_Balance,2,Very hard to put my feet in the shoe
New_Balance,2,Very little support as the whole shoe is mesh...would make a good slipper but not for walking as you can feel every stone and the foot slips back and forth because nothing but fabric is holding it in. Would never buy again.
New_Balance,2,Very little support. Shoe easily becomes unbalanced with wear. Do not use this shoe for anything other than light walking.
New_Balance,2,Very tight and snug fit. Definitely felt like an 8.5 and not a 9. Cute shoe but not meant for comfort
New_Balance,2,Very uncomfortable 😕 cute shoes but too tight and I purchased them one size bigger than needed
New_Balance,2,Very uncomfortable. Worn twice and I’ll never wear again. Waste of money!
New_Balance,2,"walking , and iy hurt my fet"
New_Balance,2,Wanted to love these shoes.  Back loop that is needed to slide your foot in and out of these shoes broke after a week. I had to cut it off so that it didn’t stick out.
New_Balance,2,Way too narrow for my foot. I’m normally an 8 in Adidas and a 9 in Nike so I purchased 8.5 in these. I don’t think they would’ve been comfortable even if I sized up to a 9
New_Balance,2,"Way too small! I ordered 1/2 a size up and they did not fit. I normally wear a 9 1/2 but when I went to put them on, it felt like a size 8. My toes were so cramped and they were so uncomfortable. I even checked the size on the inside of the shoe to make sure they sent the right size."
New_Balance,2,"Well these were $34 at the time so I felt it was worth the purchase just as old lady kick around shoes. I would NOT pay more than $35 for a pair. I shopped for NB because I have wide feet & needed more room on the sides. That’s all these do. House wide feet. Otherwise they are way too light & flimsy. These have NO arch support & no stability. I pronate and just wanted black sneakers to walk short distances. They are good for short errands like when you DRIVE to supermarket. I can’t walk any substantial distance in these. Btw, not sure it’s the shoe, but my plantar fasciitis has flared up—I think due to lack of arch support and instability of shoe but that’s an educated guess."
New_Balance,2,"While the shoe fits as far as length and width, it is too tight around the top of my foot."
New_Balance,2,"While the sneaker itself was a wide shoe in the ball area of the foot, the heel and arch were much too narrow for a good fit. Cute shoe, but I wouldn’t suggest this specific type for those with a wider size throughout the entire foot."
New_Balance,2,"Wife normally wears a 10 which, was too small for her. Exchanged for a 10.5 and still too small."
New_Balance,2,"Wrong color. Didn't notice until after the fact I wore them, because I just thought I was imagining things. Was going to contact the seller to buy another pair in black as I asked and just ask for ten bucks off or something, but that's not an option. So instead. You get a two."
Nike,2,"...but I received a torn sneaker box, held together with rubber bands. Inside were my sneakers, but they appear tried on as indicated by the laces."
Nike,2,For show only. If you want a kids shoe that lasts ...this is not it. I've spent half the money on shoes for my grandsons and they have stood up far better than these. Purchased only 2 months ago and they look a year old. Definitely will not be able to pass these down to the next  one! Disappointing.
Nike,2,I did not get the grey once. I got the black once and they have a red star next to the Nike logo and it looks weird. I order it from here because that’s the only place they had size 12. I kept them because my little boy needed them. Trying to find the correct once. I honeslty think these are not real Nike shoes. And They were not cheap.
Nike,2,"I loved how these felt - lightweight, comfortable but supportive.  I would have kept them except for the horrible seam that runs vertically from the shoelaces to the sole, just in front of the arch of my foot! It rubbed with every step.  I have a wider foot and higher arches so this may be more bothersome to me than someone with a differently shaped foot.  Unfortunately for me they were unwearable."
Nike,2,"I needed a new pair of running shoes and saw all the high reviews on this Nike shoe. The high reviews plus the affordable price for me sold on this shoe. I typically buy a half size larger due to the fact of my feet swelling while I run. I will say I felt like I was running on pillows. The shoes are som comfortable for running, I felt like I could run for hours. The only thing I would suggest is buying a half size larger because they do run a tad bit small. Other than that I have no complaints. I have to update my review. At first these running shoes were som comfortable, however since using these new pair of shoes, I’ve had constant problems with my ankles,, and toes going numb. If you have wider feet, I DO NOT recommend this shoe. Waste of my money"
Nike,2,I ordered an extra-wide shoe. The product had no size/width on/in the shoe itself but it was most definitely not wide or extra wide.
Nike,2,"I purchased these to replace my work shoes. I wore the Downshifter line, however they have stopped making them. I looked for a shoe similar in style and fit to the Downshifters. The Tanjuns were awful, I felt like my foot had been walking on a flat surface all day. I believe it’s due to no rubber tread at the bottom. I ordered the Pegasus’ after 1 time of wearing the Tanjuns. The Pegasus’ are so comfortable, with lots of padded and rubber support, as well as curvature. They were comfortable on the first day, no need for a “break in” period. Unfortunately after wearing these once, I will be throwing them away. I can’t return them because the bottom doesn’t have any rubber sole, it’s completely white/sponge material, so they look worn after one occasion. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36."
Nike,2,I was sent the wrong product. I ordered the Black/Black/White shoe and received a shoe in all black. The shoe is also too narrow and the glue is visible on the fabric. The shoe box it came in looked like it had been kicked around. Disappointed overall
Nike,2,"I was trying to find a running shoe with arch support but these have absolutely none, as they are all fashion and no function. The footbed is hard and flat as a board (see pics). If anything they make your foot overpronate because the inside arc of the outer shoe is fashionably carved out. They are cute but I would mess up my feet pretty bad running in these. Mine also came with a perforation in the toe area so I’ll probably end up returning. Not the quality of “running shoe” one would expect after dropping $80."
Nike,2,I wish I had remembered that Nikes run tight and small.  I should have sent back but hoped they would stretch some.  Just not a good fit.
Nike,2,"I’m conflicted over these shoes. They look nice and they fit my 13 year old well (size 7.5) but the toe and top of foot area has no support at all. It’s just a thin material with the netting on top so these are good for light wear like school or leisurely walking but not for anything more than that as they won’t protect that area at all if something falls on it.
Of course they’re not supposed to be steel toe quality but this is the thinnest I’ve ever seen in an athletic shoe for any of my family and this is Nike. I would expect better quality than this.
Also, whoever designed this paper thin butterfly wing tongue design WITH breathable basketball short type holes throughout the whole middle needs to be fired. It’s terrible. It’s too hard to pull up and keep in place with your hand while trying to hold onto the back of the shoe to slip onto your foot. And like I said, it’s paper thin so I suspect it will rip in the weaker side areas way before the rest of the shoe wears out which in turn, will render the shoes completely useless and unwearable.

He says he will keep them because he likes the color and fit but I really feel like I will have to be replacing them within a few months whereas his usual Nike that I buy lasts him a complete school year.
Not worth the $60 price tag on them at all!  Not even close!!
Shop for a different shoe!"
Nike,2,"i’m super disappointed. these shoes are very narrow and small. my shoe size is an 8.5, always dead on, and so i ordered an 8.5 and unfortunately they were too small and tight. there was also a ridge on the instep sean (right under the arch) and it was really uncomfortable to walk on. i submitted a return. if you have narrow feet, order a half size up and these will probably work fine for you. they were awful for me.

the design is darling (i ordered the black with rose gold detail) and i sooo wish they’d worked for me. looks just like the image. arrived on time as well, just terribly sized.

also - i went to a local dsw and found this same shoe (same price) and tried it on in a 9 just for kicks.. the toe area was more acceptable, however there was still an uncomfortable ridge on the instep."
Nike,2,I’ve only had these for 7 months and the tread it already worn and peeling off. For this money they should hold up for much longer.
Nike,2,love nike. wrong size for third time
Nike,2,love the sneaker I'm  having suck a hard time returning all the pairs now that are on my kitchen table
Nike,2,More uncomfortable than Chucks
Nike,2,"My son really loved these shoes. They were very comfortable and probably still are to him. It's only been a month or so since we got them. Today I just happen to look down and see them fraying at the seems. The sole was peeling off as well.  I have to say, this is a record for shoes being wore out so quickly. Lesson learned...read the negative reviews and not just the positive ones."
Nike,2,No me agradó
Nike,2,Ordené unos size 8 y me mandaron size 9!
Nike,2,Ordered black with white swish for my son. His current shoes were size 11 and he were starting to get a little tight and worn so I ordered a size 12. They are smaller than his size 11 shoes!  Unfortunately I can no longer get another pair in a bigger size.
Nike,2,Product is too tight
Nike,2,Runs small. Its unfortunate as its a cute shoe and no more in stock in the half-size up.
Nike,2,"Seems to be a variation in Nike sizes. This US 5.5 is only equal to a UK 3, - in other shoes its a UK 4 or 4.5 so beware if like me, ordering from overseas !"
Nike,2,So disappointed they already tore in the toe.
Nike,2,So some reason they were not wide enough. Sucks but I guess I'm stuck with them
Nike,2,"The bottom around the toe came apart after a few wears (maybe 3-4 times). Since it wasn't new, I could return. Super glue fixed it.

Fit a little tight in length and width. The arch support isnt great. Seems like you sink into the memory foam and then there is no support. As a person with arch problems, I couldn't wear them for walking, whichnis why I got them."
Nike,2,the shoe is super nice but it is too small like one size smaller than normal
Nike,2,The soles are not comfortable. I did not realize that these were not Nike Air.
Nike,2,There was yellow glue call over the sides of the shoe.
Nike,2,These seem too lightweight and inflexible for running. Also run small.
Nike,2,"These shoes run small. I went by the overall comments of others as they said these fit correctly. My shoes I ordered a size 10 as that is what I wear and they are small. I am debating on ordering a 10.5, but if those don't fit I am out of luck on money. I had $5 taken out of my return money for sending these shoes back and also they are taking 20% for a ""restocking fee"". Overall the outside of the shoes are awesome. I love the look of them."
Nike,2,These were poorly made of cheap materials and were very uncomfortable at the top of foot. Returned immediately. Big box store quality.  :/
Nike,2,These were smaller than I expected
Nike,2,This is not the pair of sneakers you want for long standing and walking. Terrible cushioning.
Nike,2,to small
Nike,2,Very disappointed on the way these sneakers ran. Regular shoe size is 5 ordered a size larger and unable to get them on. Will be returning this item
Nike,2,Very expensive and cumbersome to return things to this seller.
Nike,2,"We ordered grey & The order indicates that, but the box clearly reads black & The shoe is black."
Nike,2,"When I received this, of course I thought I was buying NEW for the price!!!!!
The box was damaged, rubber and around it..now mind you, this box was sitting in another box! (So not the cause of shipping!)
One Shoe lace all untied as if someone had worn it. Other shoe it was tied.
The bottom of the shoe you could tell it had been walked in.
I just wished if things are used, STOP charging so dam much, AND let a person know!!!!!"
UA,2,Bought them after loving my first pair. My first pair got pretty worn so I bought a new pair same size and somehow they were not. These new ones gave me so many blisters on my feet and hurt so bad every time I wore them. I don’t know what changed  but I definitely wouldn’t buy these again.
UA,2,"Comfortable shoes, however the shoes I got were black and white whereas the photo showed blue and black"
UA,2,"For me these shoes where not comfortable at all. I did not like them and gave them away. Friend did like them and thought they where "" ok"""
UA,2,"Great shoes for working out, however NOT great for someone on the medical field who’s on their feet all day!"
UA,2,had to return them. I ordered a half size up and they were still too small
UA,2,"hurts on my sole, uncomfortable"
UA,2,I am a long distance runner and have had to wear my old sneakers bc these hurt my big toe so badly that my toenail is bruised! A size 8 is normally a little loose in the toe region but these are super tight and uncomfortable. I am disappointed.
UA,2,I am really disappointed in how stiff these shoes are. Tried to break them in but wearing them for long stretches for a few days in a row has not done the trick.
UA,2,I bought the size I usually wear. They were just slightly too small
UA,2,"I bought these shoes back in March for work. They didn't really need ""breaking in"" like some of my previous shoes.
I have back problems and I figured a new pair of shoes with some good support would benefit me in the long run considering how much walking/hiking I do.
These shoes have been absolutely wonderful.
But THEY DON'T BREATHE.
I have never had problems with foot odor until I got these shoes.
I wore them for two 8 hour shifts and the smell started they're so comfy that I've been stuffing dryer sheets in them to keep the smell from being so bad.
For the people like ""well you need to wear socks""
I do. Fresh clean socks every single time.
I'm on my feet majority of the day.
These shoes fit the comfort and support but if you expect to be running around all day in them, plan on doing a foot soak and leaving the shoes at the door."
UA,2,I didn't get the color I asked for sucks but thank you
UA,2,"I don’t know exactly what is going on with this shoe, but there is some something in the cushioning (maybe there isn’t enough of it) beneath the ball of the foot that has caused (multiple times, because I don’t learn easy) an enormous blister on the underside of my right big toe when I use them for running. Won’t be doing that again (I do learn eventually). They seem okay for walking and are otherwise comfortable, but really disappointing since I wanted good running shoes."
UA,2,I guess they were to small for me. They tore up the back of my ankles and was kind of tight. I’m typically an 8.5 but they weren’t true to size it seems. I gave them to my 12 year old daughter
UA,2,I had to return them because the top back of shoe rubbed my heel raw. It took about 2 weeks to heal why still wearing other shoes.
UA,2,I have a pair of Under Armour crossfit (I believe they are the Gemini line) and I love them!  I had them for about 9 years and finally they needed to be replaced.  So I bought these thinking they would be lightweight and comfy like my other shoes.  Not so!  They are very tight and bulky.  Heavy.  One plus is that they have lots of cushion.  I suggest something from another company.  I regret my purchase.
UA,2,"I have the same brand size 8 from DSW, love it. Ordered 8.5 for Summer. It is tighter than size 8. Sent it back."
UA,2,I love these shoes but they have a major defect that the company does not care to fix. The top mesh part wears out very quickly where your big toe presses on it. It wears out to the point that you can see your socks. This happens within 3 months of wear. This is my 2nd pair I bought and it happened to both pairs. If they would fix this then I would buy these shoes again.
UA,2,I ordered a 10. I wear a 9.5 in other shoes.  These were too short. I had to send them back. Bummer.
UA,2,"I ordered the 2 wide. It was not very wide at all and had 0 arch support. When I put arch supports in the shoes were too tight, especially in the toe area. I couldn't wear them."
UA,2,"I really wanted to like these sneakers because they look so nice, but I had to return them for being so uncomfortable. The backs rubbed my heel so they hurt to walk in."
UA,2,I returned this shoe.  It had hardly any support.
UA,2,I think these sneakers are super cute. However upon arrival at my house it looked like they were already worn. Like someone had ordered and worn them and then put them back in the box and returned them. Sorry but under armor is too expensive to pay full price for something used.
UA,2,"I wanted the shoe with the white soles, what i received and am sending back is all black.  Fit well and are cute just not what I ordered."
UA,2,"I was excited to get new exercise shoes, but these just haven't been great. I thought I just needed to get used to them, so I've worn them for a couple of weeks. But they just don't have enough support and the back part around the ankle is weirdly big and keeps giving me blisters. I've gone back to using my old Nike tenishoes that are worn and a little small, because they're actually more comfortable.

I'd return them, but I've worn them too much, so I don't think I can. If you do get them, wear them inside for at least a couple of hours before you decide whether or not to keep them."
UA,2,I’m a 6 1/2 and order 6 1:3 and it was too small
UA,2,"It fits small , the material not stretchy enough"
UA,2,"It was all good till I started getting a blister around my 4th toe a few weeks back and it still hurts. Thankfully, my lady that I go to for pedicures did what she could and now my feet feel better but wish I can return these and get some Nike's instead.
Yes, I even got a half size larger and wide."
UA,2,It was cutting into my heels 😠
UA,2,Love the look of the shoes but did not fit well. Too tight around the toes.
UA,2,"Love the shoe BUT, I’ve worn them just a few times and the threading at the toe is already broke and unraveling!  I’ve never had this happen with a athletic shoe!  Cheap thread!  Buyer beware!"
UA,2,No support.
UA,2,Not color I I saw in ordering white / gray but I got mostly gray...shoe doesn't look like the one in picture I look at
UA,2,Not happy with the fit
UA,2,Not very much cushion. Only for walking or weights.
UA,2,Not very quality shoes for the UA name..  possibly knock offs
UA,2,Ok shoes but they are definitely fake. These are definitely not under armour shoes. I have a pair from the actual under armour store and the quality is way better than these. These are china knock offs. That said they aren’t too bad comfort wise but they aren’t the u see armour quality you are looking for. Be very wary of buying shoes on Amazon this is the second knock off pair of shoes I have gotten unfortunately.
UA,2,"Pros: love the look of the shoe and the sole has the perfect balance of cushion and energy return.
Cons: -arch support. If you have any desire for arch support, you won’t find it here. This shoe relies on the sidewall being enough to support your arches."
UA,2,Real disappointed in these.  There's an obvious blue tint to the outline of the shoes in there photo but when they arrived they're solid black and white.  They also have a weird squeak to them when you walk on hard surfaces. Thinking of just returning them.
UA,2,"Really like the shoe, but one of the shoelace holders ripped making it unwearable. Owned for just over one month and they are in really good condition.  Very disappointed this happened and now too late to return."
UA,2,"Runs small, tight. But nice sneaker"
UA,2,Shoes are super heavy and bulky.  Not comfortable at all.  Totally disappointed and sent back.  I wanted these for a 12 hr work day.
UA,2,Size 11 woman runs really small it was more like a 9.5 or 10
UA,2,"Sizing was spot on. Loved the style and color. Unfortunately, I need something with a bit more support than what these offered. I still kept them. I just can’t wear these to work. Not made for standing on concrete for hours. But to throw on and take the dog out for a walk or pitch a few balls, they are great for that. Price is very affordable."
UA,2,"So, I thought that I was ordering the black and white pair because of how it was displayed on the page, but the fully black pair arrived. The shoes fit fine overall, but they do seem a bit clunky and make my feet seem wide."
UA,2,Sole of shoe that glues to the toe portion has come unglued after one day of school
UA,2,The bottom of the shoe was black not white.  A little disappointed
UA,2,The shoe came with a stain luckily I have shoe cleaner that took it out but it still came with a stain which it should have.
UA,2,"The shoe rub the back of my heel.they are to deep flat,that’s why the back rub my heel."
UA,2,The shoes are nice but give me bad blisters on the back of my ankle.
UA,2,"The shoes in general are great, but they rub the back of my ankles. I wish they didn't because otherwise they are comfortable."
UA,2,The sole of the shoe is peeling off after only minimal use.
UA,2,The stitching started coming apart after 2 weeks. I work at a vet clinic but I'm not THAT hard on my shoes. I'm very disappointed
UA,2,The support only lasted a day. I was disappointed since everyone recommend underarmour for tennis shoes.
UA,2,"These shoes look nice. They feel horrible. I have a flat arch and regular width feet. The shoes seem like they are made for someone with a narrow foot and high arch. My feet hurt horribly after my shift as a nurse. I’ve worn them three times thinking they just needed to be broken in, but no change."
UA,2,They are a little tight. Believe I need to get a size 9 instead of 8.5.
UA,2,They were great shoes until I threw them in the washer once!!! It collapsed and ruined the heal and it now hurts to wear them.
UA,2,They were too small
UA,2,"This shoe is a standard shoe. Its light, not a lot of cushion. Just a regular shoe. I like the style and rich color and design, but could have been a better shoe instead of an average shoe"
UA,2,This shoe runs on the smaller side and definitely not comfortable... it’s a very hard insole. I returned them.
UA,2,Too small
UA,2,Too small
UA,2,Too small - not a true 8.5
UA,2,Too tight on my feet.
UA,2,Very narrow shoes fit very tight
UA,2,We oder the black and white shoes and received all black shoes.
UA,2,"We ordered this shoe which was advertised with a teal stripe when the item was received it was black and white, looking like a men's shoe without the feminine detail of the stripe. I wanted to return it immediately b/c we didn't get what was advertised but my daughter didn't want to wait another week with no guarantee that the advertised item would be received.
Not pleased at all!"
UA,2,"Well the photo for these shoes was a black and white shoe, with a description of black/black, with A PICTURE OF A BLACK AND WHITE SHOE. Today I opened an all black shoe. Not happy."
UA,2,Wrong shoe. Black w black sole. Picture was black with white sole. Cheaper made than what was ordered because it was a replacement for existing pair I own. Also delivery was to wrong house.
Adidas,1,"""I love these cloudfoam shoes from Adidas! They fit perfectly, they’re light, perfect from working out, the tongue is built in so it doesn’t move around while you workout. I highly recommend this pattern as well!""

That was my review the day after I bought them. All was fine and well at the gym. After 3 visits to the gym, running on the treadmill for 15 minutes, going 7mph for probably a total of 7 minutes out the 15, and then lifting for 75 minutes, I started to experience severe pain in both of my knees near my MCL. I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just sore muscles from working out. Then started my L ankle pain. It progressively got worse, and eventually I couldn't even walk anymore. I started to assume it was the shoes seeing as there is ZERO support from these shoes. I ended up returning them, and continued to work out wearing different shoes. The damage was done, and things got much much worse. I'm a nurse, so I tried to just ice, take ibuprofen, and rest. That wasn't doing the trick so I went to my nearest urgent care. After 7 x-ray images, I found out I had severe tendinitis and swelling in my L ankle, and both of my knees. Thankfully it wasn't a hairline fracture, which I was thinking it may have been considering how excruciating the pain was. No gym for 2 weeks, ankle wrap, naproxen, rest, and icing was my treatment. Not a fun outcome seeing as I go to the gym 5-6x a week.

IN SUMMARY: Do not buy these shoes if you intend to use them at the gym."

Adidas,1,"“These shoes were not what the picture looked like. They looked like cafeteria shoes,also they have me the wrong size, never again will I buy these shoes off Amazon or ever in the store.”"
Adidas,1,"1 shoe fit correctly and the other one was too big. The bottoms were dirty. Almost like someone wore them, and then returned them and they sent them back out. I returned them. Totally not happy with the purchase."
Adidas,1,A friend of mine raved how great this sneaker is.  So I purchased a pair. I do not feel that this sneaker gives any support and was also narrow. So I returned them
Adidas,1,"Adidas shoes I purchased were cheap, no support and not worth the money!!
Why has the quality gone way down in the past few years too many USA companies being shipped to China!
I won’t purchase this brand again!"
Adidas,1,After exhausted just trying to put on the shoes (with and without socks) I sent them back.  Shoes should not wear you out just trying to put them on.
Adidas,1,"After wearing these no more than 5 times, this hole began to form. Now I can fit my finger through it. This is the 2nd pair of Adidas Cloudfoam shoes I have purchased this summer and both of them are like this. If you like to walk/run a lot, don’t get these."
Adidas,1,"Although cute & stylish, these are the most uncomfortable athletic shoes I've ever worn. I only walked around in them for an hour or so,  and my feet/ ankles/shins/calves/knees hurt for days!!! Disappointing for Adidas brand,  which I've always found reliable in the past."
Adidas,1,Awesome materials and fitting.
Adidas,1,"Beware- This tennis shoe is a huge disappointment. I previously ordered the EXACT same shoe in white color. It fit great and was comfortable. This shoe in red/orange color was ordered in same size but fits completely different. The entire shoe is stiff, cannot even get heel into shoe without struggling and using a shoe spoon. Basically, I expected the same make, style and size shoe to fit the same way. This is not the case. Contacted both the seller and Adidas with this concern/complaint. Seller pawned off on Adidas and Adidas Customer Service did nothing to assist and appeared to not care."
Adidas,1,"Beware! These sa hoes are not authentic! As soon as you I opened the package and seen the box it was obvious. I own 3 other pairs of Adidas. Same style, cloudfoam. These would not slide in like the rest. The color was off and the style. If you have purchased these, compare them to a pair from a retail store."
Adidas,1,Big and flimsy. They don't feel like real shoes. They seemed like something you'd get at a discount store full of unrecognizable brands.
Adidas,1,"Bought these right before our cruise.  Was a little weary of wearing new shoes to walk a lot.  But these shoes might be the most comfortable I’ve ever owned!!  I don’t like the look of the shoe strings tied.. but I just tuck them in, that’s just a preference.  I did buy an 8, as normally I can wear a 8-81/2.. and I like my tennis shoes snug.  But these were RIGHT at the tips of my toes!  If I bought again I would go up 1/2 size, maybe eve n a whole size."
Adidas,1,Cheap and flimsy. Reviews said they had great support and were good for plantar fasciitis. They don’t. They aren’t.
Adidas,1,"Cheap quality, no support, and tongue too high."
Adidas,1,Cute but 0 support. I’m a speed walker and my feet were hurting bad after about a hour walk :( so sad! I returned them.
Adidas,1,"Definitely not Adidas quality. 2 sizes too big, no cushioning, sole ready to snap after 2 weeks of casual use."
Adidas,1,Did not come how described. I have the same exact pair from a store and these amazon ones almost look “fake”. I don’t think they’re real addidas so beware. Size was way off too way to small. Very disappointed as these use to be my favorite sneakers.
Adidas,1,Didn’t like them. The fit was pretty tight.
Adidas,1,DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES- i have another pair of these shoes form a store and they were great. Purchased them on here and just opened them up and they are clearly used old shoes. I never ever write a review but everyone needs to know DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!
Adidas,1,Do not buy these. There is no lining inside. These are not real adidas. I should have known by the price! Immediately had to return! Don’t waste your time.
Adidas,1,DO NOT BUY! I’m so disappointed. I bought a pair (in different color) a few months back and loved them. Very well made. This pair I got was apparently a knock off and not the real thing. Very upset.
Adidas,1,DO NOT BUY! It is cheaply made and there is no support. I would not recommend it for the gym nor for walking around.
Adidas,1,"Do not like them, after 3 weeks it felt like I have worn them for 6 months!!"
Adidas,1,"Don’t be fooled... these shoes are NOT made for running. Virtually no support. Does not hug your foot. My feet are normal width but they rattle around in these shoes. Also, they’re poorly made, so one foot has interior stitching that rubs my feet. I would return them, but I have blood on the rim from a blister they caused right away."
Adidas,1,"Don’t buy these shoes! They wear out so fast! One of mine got a hole in the bottom after 6 weeks. (The photo is after about 10 weeks. The blue is duct tape I used to try and extend their life.) Adidas customer service refused to help, saying: “Items damaged by normal wear and tear or that have exceeded the reasonable life of the product are not replaced.” So if 3-4 days per week for 6 weeks is the “reasonable life” of Adidas shoes, then I will never waste my money on them again!"
Adidas,1,"Don’t hold together well, super uncomfortable."
Adidas,1,dosent fit
Adidas,1,"FAKE! I have a real pair of adidas and compared the tag. You will see the real adidas tag is on the left in the photos. Also, the box label is completely different. The real is on the left. The real shoes also bring like a neon little foam thing that hangs from the laces. The shoes I bought on amazon did not bring that AND THEY WERE SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE. They feel NOTHING like the real thing. Please be cautious when buying."

Adidas,1,Fake. I should have read more of the reviews. They are 100% fake- verified by comparing the serial numbers. They should not match.
Adidas,1,FAKE. the soles of the shoe say cloud foam super. NOT ADIDAS INSIDE. and the fit of the shoe is wider than a regular adidas shoe. Not gonna lie they looked very similar
Adidas,1,"FAKES!! These are not adidas originals, if they cost $30 it'd be ok to receive fake shoes. Not if you're going to charge $70 for a pair of FAKES, alleging they are real adidas"
Adidas,1,Feels more like a house shoe than an outdoor running or walking shoe.  Poor quality and overpriced.
Adidas,1,"Felt like a knockoff. Very little cushion, I could feel the asphalt against my feet. Went on half a walk today and cut it early to go home and start my return."
Adidas,1,"First and foremost, please note this doesn’t have a movable tongue like most athletic shoes do, so you cannot loosen them to help get them on.  It took me 15 mins just to get them on my feet. It was quite the struggle. I ended up having to take a utensil through the loop in the back and pull it on that way. Maybe I have fat feet, I dunno, but that method is not conducive to anything. I am sending these back. They are very cute though! Just not my style."
Adidas,1,First ones I got were stolen so I had to wait on a replacement pair which were dirty and uncomfortable. Still waiting on refund! Wouldn’t recommend!
Adidas,1,"First, these are not running shoes at all. The foam cushioning is very thin. The worst part is the way the shoes laced up. I returned them the day after I got them."
Adidas,1,"Fit too big. Not comfortable, does not feel like a cloud. Would not be comfortable to wear for any type of exercise or walking."
Adidas,1,Fits prefect
Adidas,1,Gaped at top of shoe. Couldn’t cinch it in.
Adidas,1,"Hello. Yesterday I received my order and was very disappointed because one shoe is much more larger then another one in a same pair. Also there are orange stains on the back side of sole. Photos are enclosed.
I suspect that the shoes are not original. I would definitely return the item if there were no additional delivery expenses (as I live out of USA and used additional forwarder to organize shipping) and long returning period."
Adidas,1,"honestly, these feel like knock-offs! They aren't durable. I wear these 4x a week walking and they're completely worn out. I got theses as a gift for Valentines Day and 30 days later, they are TRASHED."
Adidas,1,Horrible quality. I bought these in March. By April the stripes on the sides were peeling off. By July I have a hole clear through the bottom of the sole. I wear these to walk my dog 2 miles 3 -5 times a week. I really can't believe that an Adidas product would wear out so quickly.
Adidas,1,"I absolutely loved these sneakers except for the fact that they came with stains on them. I wish this could have been a good review because the sneakers are super cute, but it’s almost as if they sent me someone else’s dirty previously returned shoes."
Adidas,1,I actually was looking forward to these giving my feet relief and yes they are quite comfortable once you wear them for a day or two but I have literally had them for 10 days and the left one has a hole straight through the bottom. I will be returning for my money back.
Adidas,1,"I am a marathon runner and have been lucky to have never injured myself during training. I read the reviews on these trainers and was keen to try them out because I prefer lightweight shoes. Unfortunately, within two weeks of wearing these, I developed trochanteric bursitis and was unable to move, let alone run, for three months. I didn't change anything in my training regimen other than these sneakers. You do the math."
Adidas,1,"I am a true 6.5 in most brands including Adidas. I ordered a 6.5 and the shoes that came said 6.5 but fit like a 7.5 or 8. Way too big and wide. They were really cute; however, they didn’t feel or look authentic. I found the real ones directly on the adidas website: Puremotion shoes, used the coupon code stripes, and got authentic Adidas shoes orig. $70 for $54 and free shipping! After seeing the real ones on the Adidas website, it is clear these are not authentic."
Adidas,1,"I am an RN, and I've been wearing Adidas cloudfoam shoes the past few years for my 12 hour busy ER shifts. The tongue is stiff and sewn in place and rubs against the front of my foot with each step. Also, these are slip ons (ew!) and really hard to get on. The color is adorable and I love the burgundy, but I won't be able to wear these even casually due to how uncomfortable they are. The shape of the shoe is kind of funky itself and not flattering.
I bought a 9.5 and they were true to size. Would not recommend."
Adidas,1,"I am embarrassed that I bought this shoe because I assumed the Adidas brand afforded a certain level of comfort and usability, however neither are true as shown by this shoe. My feet felt like I was walking with thin styrofoam badly wrapped on my feet. The molding of the shoe is so preset that any divergence or minute difference in foot shape or size, your foot will hurt and feel wildly uncomfortable. My five year old shoes that have been beat up and are a little out of shape are more wearable. Ultimately, if you find these shoes for $5 then maybe it’s okay, but anything over $5 then you got ripped off. Ultimately, the aesthetic look is what you are paying for, but even then I was disappointed as how they looked. I did work out in them and was not impressed."
Adidas,1,"I bought a pair for Christmas....they are fake!! I went to every shoe store and official Adidas website and they aren't the same shoe. The inside doesn't say Adidas, and its supposed to. IM PISSED"
Adidas,1,"I bought a pair of these in 2019 and loved them. I put a lot of walking miles on the over the past year and a half and decided it was time for a new pair. I’m pretty sure the new ones are knock offs. They’re definitely not made of the same material. Even though they’re the exact same size, the new pair is incredibly wide. The box and tag have weird typos and inconsistencies compared to regular adidas boxes.
I don’t know if there’s any way to prove or verify if they’re knock offs but they’re nothing like my previous pair. I’m really disappointed. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to buy anything Amazon."
Adidas,1,I bought my husband and daughter a pair of these tennis shoes and they love them however when I bought myself a pair on my left foot they rub right under my ankle so I’m unable to wear them. I was going to return them to see if a smaller size would help however we have been so caught up with hurricane Michael destruction but I was over the days to return.
Adidas,1,"I bought Similar grey Adidas cloud foam shoes From a retail store and absolutely loved how comfortable they were and how long they lasted. I was attempting to replace them with these but they are NOT the same. These shoes cannot be cloud foam, as they have absolutely zero support. I took My son and dog for a walk for 30 minutes and wanted to return home right away because my back and hips were hurting so bad from just walking in these shoes. I do not recommend wearing them for anything other than errands. Further, my original shoes had various  parts like all shoes do. This shoe is one slip on piece like a sock with a sole. You can’t even tighten the laces because they’re on there as like a design rather than a function. These are really sketchy."
Adidas,1,"I bought the exact same shoe in a local store 3 months ago. It fit perfectly.  The pair I ordered on line, in the same size, was a whole size too small.  Very disappointing."
Adidas,1,"I bought these Adidas shoes in mid-July and by November, they were falling apart. I walk my dogs approximately 4-7mi a day and wore these for regular errands. I'm 5'10 and 130lbs, so its not like I heavily beat up on my shoes. I am very disappointed in this Adidas product and will not be buying them again. I have had to shoe-goo the bottom of these three times now (see picture of third time) and they are just not worth continually trying to salvage at this point. I had a pair of Nike Free Runs that lasted for 6 years and the only reason I threw them out was because they started to rip away at the fabric, not the sole!"
Adidas,1,"I bought these reading all the rave reviews on how comfortable they are. Being 7 1/2 months pregnant with very swollen feet, ankles and only one pair of shoes that currently fit, I figured this was a great solution.

I received these today and was very disappointed. The “tongue” of the sneaker DOES NOT MOVE. You cannot adjust or pull the front of the shoe forward to help get your foot in. You have to have very skinny feet to even attempt to get your foot inside the shoe."
Adidas,1,I bought these shoes recently ( have only had for about 2 months) and I walk/ bike and run in them. They look horrible! They stretched out so much they barely fit. It looks like I had them for years !! I wouldn’t recommend these shoes! I want to try to get a refund or atleast partial credit back for these! They really shouldn’t look like this after only 2 months! Disappointed
Adidas,1,I bought these shoes to wear to work because I am on my feet in a distribution center all night and needed very light weight comfortable shoes...these ARE NOT! They hurt my feet so bad and I even tried dr schol inserts. I returned them after a week because they were the worst shoes I have ever owned.
Adidas,1,"I bought these to run in and my first run I thought I had a sticker in the tongue of my shoe, but afterwards realized it was the tongue of the shoe rubbing against my shin and left an abrasion on both legs☹️"
Adidas,1,"I bought this tennis shoes because it’s an excellent brand,  I tried on at the store, they didn’t have the color I wanted.
When I tried on they were  very comfortable.
So I decided to buy it on line.
As soon as I wear the tennis shoes, you can feel in your feet in the inside the extra material I showed in the picture, which makes them very uncomfortable, I even got a blister.
I have many Adidas tennis shoes and never happened to me."
Adidas,1,I didn’t realize from the photo that these DONT really lace up. They also have a poor quality sole. Will be returning...
Adidas,1,"I dislike that they don’t tie very tight,"
Adidas,1,"I disliked this item because I got them for a Christmas gift to a real close friend.  And when she opened them, we realized they were used.  Most embarrassing time of my life."
Adidas,1,I do not think these are real. I have addidas shoes identical to these I bought instore . These were not the same...at all. I sent them back for a refund.
Adidas,1,"I don’t believe this is a real adidas product. No support, felt like I wasn’t wearing shoes, and when I put them on, I SWEAR I heard the crunch of thin cardboard. Returned immediately."
Adidas,1,"I don’t have wide feet what so ever, these must be a knock off. They are so so so narrow, the sides of my feet go over the soles when I walk or run.  I walked for 1 minute and my legs already hurt. And the lip digs into the top part of my ankle with every step. Must be a knock off."
Adidas,1,"I expected these to be comfortable but
These were very disappointing for me.  They hurt my feet at the tongue and weren’t that cushioned.  Returned them promptly."
Adidas,1,"I got one shoe size 9 and the other one was a size 6, just great. They didn’t even check the box to make sure it was the same pair. Aside from that they feel cheaply made and not comfortable at all."
Adidas,1,I guess they meant real clouds cause your foot goes right through the padding and smacks the pavement. These are like water socks. I use them for dirty jobs in yard now.
Adidas,1,"I had bought this same shoe in the store and loved them! The sole went pretty quickly (I walk a lot!) so I decided to purchase the exact same shoe on here. Well, it looked the same but the fit was way off-tight and narrow. After wearing the shoes for 2 days I developed pain on the top of my feet. Too bad, definitely don’t buy if you’re expecting the same shoe you’ve gotten in the store."
Adidas,1,"I had previously tried these sneakers on in the store then decided to buy them on amazon afterwards. These are not the advertised product. They are a cheaply made knock off, which is evident when you feel how low quality the bottom of the shoe is. Looks like the real thing, but do not purchase if intent is to wear them for any sort of activity."
Adidas,1,"I have a size 7  of this running shoes and I wanted to buy another one because it's so comfortable. But this is one that I got is so tight, it's uncomfortable.  Can I still return it if I wore it one time already?"
Adidas,1,"I have about 5 pairs of Adidas shoes and this was horrible quality.
Looks like a fake adidas sneaker. Definitely not the real deal!"
Adidas,1,I have had these shoes for 2 months and the soles are already worn out. I walk in them about 3 times a week and there’s literally a hole almost through the bottom.
Adidas,1,"I have purchased these twice. The first pair were amazing but I wore them to work (in healthcare) and didn’t want to wear them casually. The second pair I received looked NOTHING like the last pair! The toe area is bulky, the material is not the same at all, it hard? The stripes on the side were peeling off before I even opened the box. Not happy with the second pit at all but I absolutely love my first pair! Just a gamble I guess 🤷🏼‍♀️"
Adidas,1,"I have the original cloud foams and absolutely loved them. I bough these thinking they would be the same, but I never realized there is no traditional tongue. Instead, it's all one unit and part of the top of the sneaker. I have no clue who designed this thing but that tongue is STIFF--and it literally jabs into your leg every time you walk. It's a horrible design. I actually had to return these and went back and ordered the original ones (I believe this was supposed to be an upgrade). Horrible design. Beware."
Adidas,1,I have the same pair that I purchased from a store. These were not the same quality and fit much more narrow.  Wondering if these are actually a knock off as they also had a weird generic tag.  I’m returning them but couldn’t get an answer as to whether these were fakes or not.

Adidas,1,I have wide feet and these were way too narrow and tight.
Adidas,1,"I like the comfort of the shoe, but it has terrible grip at the bottom. It gets easily dirty. The bottom of the show is already separating from the top. It doesn’t have good support for the foot."
Adidas,1,I like them and they were comfortable until I wore a hole thru the insole and the tread in 1 month. I wear them when walking my dog every day. Thought they'd hold up to that. Not durable at all.
Adidas,1,I love the color and fast delivery but I can't even get my foot into the shoe to find out if it fits.  Narrow opening.
Adidas,1,I love the comfort of these shoes. The only drawback is that I have only worn these shoes about 4 times and one of the stripes is peeling off. The other drawback is that my pant leg gets caught inside the back heel of the shoe due to how high it comes up in the the back. I love the comfort though!
Adidas,1,"I loved them because they were very comfortable BUT they only lasted 5 months!
I walk three miles almost daily and sometimes I use another shoes, yesterday I discovered the sole has a hole and is very worn out! I slip if the ground is wet. The good part is that the upper part is intact .
It is not a good option for walking. I feel disappointed And now I have to purchase another pair or walking shoes."
Adidas,1,"I need to return these .one shoe was to wide and one shoe was too narrow . Both were the same size , but two different cuts .  How do I return them ?"
Adidas,1,"I often times like to give products the benefit of the doubt...so I tried these shoes from Amazon. I originally had been looking at them at Kohl's and even tried them on there - SO COMFY and SO SOFT! It was like walking on, well, clouds! I saw these pop up in ads, and they were $20 cheaper than Kohl's - I should have known better. I decided to order them despite the bad reviews. My shoes arrived and when I tried them on they were way bigger than the ones at Kohl's (in the same size), the material was rough and scratchy (soft and stretchy from Kohl's), and there wasn't a lot of bend in these shoes - again, unlike Kohl's. Anyway, I suggest doing your research before purchasing these!"
Adidas,1,"I only walked in the house with them to try out. I am a size 7 and the vamp came too far up the top of my foot and was uncomfortable as it hit my ankle. The insole is very thin, almost like walking barefoot, the outside sole is slick and has a very shallow tread. I wanted these for walking but there is no support.  I would avoid these for anything than looking cute with leggings. Not worth the $$."
Adidas,1,"I ordered a size 6. I was so excited to receive them! The Adidas box was labeled size 6, but when I opened it, the shoes were a size 8. I didn’t send them back or contact seller because my daughter wears a 7 and will grow into them. On the bright side, they are nice shoes."
Adidas,1,"I ordered a woman’s size 9...they were marked size 9 but fit like a size 11.
What a disappointment!  Not happy at all.
I’m donating them to “Good Will”!

Very poor experience this time around with Amazon.
Linda"
Adidas,1,I ordered these shoes and the left foot doesnt match the right. It has a line of stitches across the top on one foot then not one on the other foot. I would not buy this product. It is not the same shoe as the other one.
Adidas,1,"I ordered this product for my mom, as I owned a pair and she liked them. We received our order today and the product is used and damaged. I am incredibly disappointed.  I had to give one star because I couldn't submit my review without adding a star."
Adidas,1,I ordered this sneaker for the comfort that was described. The shipping took very long to arrive. The outer material was inferior and looked like my toe would pook a hole in very easily. The one shoe fit while the other was tight and uncomfortable. I have never experienced this with any other shoe. The overall construction of the shoe seemed inferior.
Adidas,1,"I own 3 pairs already. They all fit perfectly and I love them. That being said I have compared the tags with the other new pair I got today and they are the same shoe with the exception of colors and the fact that the Oink one don’t fit even a little bit. If they came in a shoe box, I could compare the sku#’s and check out the box. The shoes came  came as is, with little TJ Maxx size numbers on the inside heel . I got scammed."
Adidas,1,"I purchased this pair for myself and another pair in black for my daughter.  I have wide feet, she has narrow feet.  Neither of us could stand these shoes.  No arch support at all.  Ankles rubbed within 5 minutes of wearing them around the house.  After 30 minutes we both boxed them back up to return them.  Keep in mind you CANNOT tie these shoes to tighten them."
Adidas,1,"I read several reviews that said good for narrow feet. I have very narrow feet, still way to floppy on my foot. Hard as a rock sole! The laces do not tighten easily. Not a good purchase. I returned."
Adidas,1,"I really wanted to like this shoe, but the front tongue piece comes up too high and rubs the front of my ankle when I tried them on. I meant to return them but I was out of town and now the return deadline has passed. So bummed, waste of money!"
Adidas,1,"I received these shoes and they were dirty, broken, and looked 10 years old. One shoe was entirely ripped off of the sole. Both shoes were covered in dirt and had been worn. They were definitely used and disgusting."
Adidas,1,"I returned these shoes immediately after trying on. There is no cushion or support, and the soles aren’t meant to last. They are cute."
Adidas,1,"I thought these were a nice fit. Received July 1, 2020, already worn through at toe and all tread as of Aug 9, 2020 as you can see in picture. Return window closed July 31, 2020. I'm not a super athlete. I walk an hour a day or get on my elliptical. Nothing crazy. Would not purchase again."
Adidas,1,I thought these would be amazingly comfortable - but they aren’t. Very disappointed and they can’t be returned. I’ve had them 4 months and worn them multiple times for a few hours at a time. Already the fabric loop at the top of the heel on the right shoe has come loose and just hangs. And inside the fabric lining in the back heel area of the left shoe there is some sort of hard metal or plastic piece that seems to be dime sized that rubs right in the center of my heel and is miserable. Since they can’t be returned I’m going to try to cut the fabric open and see if I can remove whatever the piece is that is causing so much agony. Only the left shoe has this so it seems to be a manufacturing problem. Would NOT recommend. I regret spending the money on these.
Adidas,1,I use these as my everyday work shoes (healthcare) and they are extremely comfortable! They are the only shoes that are comfortable even with Plantar Fasciitis!
Adidas,1,"I usually don’t leave reviews but this deserved one. First off the “cloudfoam” is definitely a misleading title for the woman’s running shoes, there is no padding whatsoever! They are super tight with no breathing room and I went TWO sizes up! I have small feet and can generally fit into a lot of shoes but damn these were so uncomfortable and this wasn’t even what upset me. What upset me the most was there should be an “open box” or a “recently worn” label. The shoes came dirty with spills and the bottom of the shoes were worn down- they had no traction, someone had some fun with them before returning. At least check the shoes before reselling them or half price it (if even that) for the condition they came in. Not ok."
Adidas,1,"I waited almost a year to write this review, as I like to have time to try it out.
These shoes are awful. After two months, the soles were starting to wear down completely, the “cloud foam” became non-existent, my left pinky is bust in’ out(which started three months ago) & i should have sent them back when I noticed the right upper toe didn’t appear to be “attached” completely(see third picture).
I wore these shoes 3-4 days a week, for my twelve hour work shifts & demoted them to yard work shoes.
My previous shoes I had for six years & never had this issue, not even a single hole! As far as I’m concerned Adidas these are the worst pair of shoes you’ve EVER made."
Adidas,1,I walk 5-6 miles a day for working out I had severe big blisters on bottom top of foot no support and are not a walking/running shoe shld only be a casual wear shoe
Adidas,1,I wanted a cheap pair of sneakers and saw all the great reviews so I went with these. I have absolutely no idea how these shoes have the rating they do. There wasn’t even a real insole! Absolutely zero support. Aesthetically they’re really cute but these are useless if you need to actually walk around in the shoes let alone workout.
Adidas,1,I wanted to like them but they hurt my feet at work after two hours ( I am on my feet walking 10 hours a day) I was in a lot of pain at the end of my shift.
Adidas,1,"I wanted to love these sneakers... But I didn't.  No support at all.  Very disappointed!!
Also... it's a bit hard to get your foot into the sneaker.  A complete disappointment, overall."
Adidas,1,I was excited to get these shoes based on how cute they looked online. These appear to be used! The rubber is extremely scuffed as if they were scrubbed. I am very disappointed and will certainly be sending these back.
Adidas,1,"I was excited to get these shoes, but as soon as I got them I couldn’t put them on. My left foot doesn’t fit. It’s like I’m trying to slide my feet into another size shoe. The shows also have no padding they’re not soft, they don’t feel like they have any foam, or whatever. I feel so disappointed. I was excited for these shoes because of the raving reviews over comfort."
Adidas,1,"I was excited to try these with the amazon wardrobe order since i was really looking for training shoes that were light weight. However, when these came in it was basically like there were two different shoes in the box. The left shoe fit great, it was what i expected but the right shoe was so narrow and so tight, it almost like they ran out of material when the made the shoe or something. It was very weird, maybe it was a one off thing but it definitely did not make me want to buy these or even try them again sadly."
Adidas,1,I was eyeing these shoes on another site and saw they were discounted on Amazon! I got a deal! They look and fit great!
Adidas,1,"I was not crazy about these shoes.  I didn't realize that they were made of what is basically a very soft foam, with zero arch support.  It was like walking in a pair of house slippers.  I could feel every pebble under foot.  After about a month of wearing them my feet began to hurt really bad.  I think because there is no support in these, my arches might have begun to fall because I would literally hobble when I would get out of bed in the morning.  I was chalking it up to being really busy at work, I'm a chef, but I've been busier with no issues.  I bought a different pair of shoes about a month ago.  My feet have stopped hurting and I no longer have any sort of foot issues."
Adidas,1,I was not impressed with the shoe.  I returned the shoes and still waiting for a refund.  Very disappointed
Adidas,1,"I was so excited to buy these because they were so light weight and comfortable! Unfortunately, after 4.5 months they have a whole in the bottom. I wore them maybe 3x a week max to go on a walk or run errands, they were not overly worn, so I’m so disappointed that they didn’t last long at all. Definitely comfortable, but will not last long."
Adidas,1,I was very excited to get this shoes for work. Working in the medical field you are always on your feet. Once I started walking I noticed they felt very flat and not cushion-y at all!! The insole didn’t even reach my toes so it was an uncomfortable feeling. I ordered these same shoes on the Adidas website. I’m going to compare the insole and the shoe soon!
Adidas,1,"I was very excited to try my new shoes. However, after my 45 min workout, I developed severe blisters under my foot which is strange. It seems like the shoe does not provide cushion and as a result my foot could feel the friction of walking on the treadmill. Thinking of returning them!"
Adidas,1,I wear a kids size 5 shoe. The size 6 women didn’t even fit. When I tried to return you couldn’t change sizes only return. Would not try again.
Adidas,1,I wear a size 9 in shoes and these are huge. Don’t like them
Adidas,1,I wear them to work everyday indoors.  After 2 months the sole is almost disintegrating.  No support for my feet at all.  I'm very very disappointed in these shoes.  I will not buy this brand again.
Adidas,1,I’m a women’s size 9 in every shoe and these are entirely too large/ wide. Lack of support. Tried to return them and cheapest shipping was $20.
Adidas,1,"I’m almost 99% sure these are a knock off. I have the exact same shoe in the exact same color that I bought from a department store. The sizes are bigger, the inside feels different.  I should have known since these were only $50."
Adidas,1,I’m normally a size 8 and the shoe fits so small almost like trying on a size smaller. Super disappointed I’d recommend getting a size up.
Adidas,1,I’m not certain these are actually Adidas.  Every single pebble can be felt through the soles of these shoes.  Also came with questionable packaging and labels.
Adidas,1,I’ve bought these shoes before locally and they were the best. Super comfy and had cushion. I just received these today (o ordered another pair since I have complete worn my others out) they have absolutely no cushion and is so hard they already hurt my feet and I’ve had them on for an hour. I will probably stick to purchasing my shoes local instead of ever buying from amazon again. Super bummed about these.
Adidas,1,"I’ve had these shoes before and they are the best, most comfortable shoes every BUT when I received this pair, the bottoms were dirty as if they’ve been worn before."
Adidas,1,I’ve had these shoes for a short period only wearing them about once a week and the sole has already separated from the fabric on the front. Very disappointed in adidas!
Adidas,1,"I’ve had these sneakers for 2 months.. they are already destroyed. I work in a medical office, I’m not tough on sneakers what so ever. The outer fabric doesn’t hold up. I already have a rip in the back heel from who knows what.  They barely have any support. I could go on and on. I really expected more, live and learn. I’ll go back to Nikes for sure."
Adidas,1,"If you have a narrow foot, I’m afraid to say these probably won’t work for you. The tongue and shoe are one, which makes them
hard to tie tight. I had gapping on the side of the shoe. So sad as I wanted to love them."
Adidas,1,"If you have high arches, these shoes are not for you. The flooring of the shoe is pretty hard, but it’s a good show for running around doing errands."
Adidas,1,If you have super narrow feet these are the shoes for you! If you have average to wide feet keep shopping. The opening of the shoe is so small.
Adidas,1,if you have tiny kids feet these are for you but they are too small and my feet dont slip in. i had several people try them on and and same thing
Adidas,1,It cost me $22.77 to try on these shoes and found out the material is flimsy. I will NEVER order from BKK Enterprises again! I think they are a horrible Amazon seller!
Adidas,1,It doesn’t have much support. They look nice on the outside but not very confortable.
Adidas,1,"it is basically piece of foam that has no support or comfort, id rather be barefoot."
Adidas,1,It is not a wide with like it said
Adidas,1,It looks like I was sent a wide width and a regular width shoe! And they are a size too big! Seriously think they are a knock off.
Adidas,1,It was to large
Adidas,1,It’s fine I suppose. They are like 1/4 of fabric and provide 0 support. They soak up water like a sponge
Adidas,1,"It's too small, i exchanged it with larger. Even the larger turned out to be small. Really difficult to get into it."
Adidas,1,"I've bought it twice already but they were too small both times. Each time I tried to get a size up the price increased by ten dollars. I'm usually an 8 1/2 but apparently I'm a ten in these shoes... but I wouldn't know because now they are out of stock, it's a month later and I still don't have new shoes. Just very disappointed that it says true to size and doesn't have a measurement chart and they should have price matched my first purchase."
Adidas,1,I've bought this exact shoe 4 times off Amazon and they were all great. The last pair I bought(3/21) fit completely different and the materials felt cheap. The sole was very narrow compared to my other pairs especially the toe box(no my other pairs were not wide) I honestly thought they were a knock off because of how different everything was from my 4 other pairs.
Adidas,1,"I've had these shoes for a little over a month, I wear them multiple times a week, and they have already started to wear down so significantly on both shoes that there are holes developing where the padding of your feet are. Not running with them either, just walking for a half an hour a day and also wearing at the office where I'm sitting most of the time. I can't imagine what shape they would be in if I was running in them. Very disappointed."
Adidas,1,I've had these shoes for less than a month and the soles are already written out. I do not recommend.
Adidas,1,I've moderately worn these shoes for a few months and they are falling apart. Rocks and other stuff gets in them very easily as well. I suspect they are not actual Adidas.
Adidas,1,Just horribly made and no support. I almost thought these was fake because the poor support. They’re flat and don’t feel like my usual adidas.
Adidas,1,"Literally worst shoe ever, they do not have tongues so they are impossible to put on even though they are correct size. Do not buy if you want easy slip on sneakers."
Adidas,1,"Little to no support, the front tab is VERY uncomfortable all day and they are just over all not comfortable or good for standing in for any period of time let alone walking."
Adidas,1,"Llegaron  antes  de  lo  esperado, súper  cómodos . Lo  único  es  que  me  hubiese gustado  que  las  trenzas  no fueran tan  largas  ya que  no  son  necesarias.. que fueran solo de  adorno"
Adidas,1,Look cheap. Tongue is completely sewn in all the way up so if you need to tighten the laces the shoes buckles and creates weird flap
Adidas,1,"Love my new Adidas shoes. Great price. Went to a sporting goods store in person and the same shoe was double the price there. Comfortable, lightweight, fashionable. What more can you ask for?"
Adidas,1,"Loved how cute they are and saw all the rave reviews so I was so excited to get them. Wore them on my trip to Martha's Vineyard for sightseeing and being with the family. I know I averaged a few miles a day but damn I thought they would hold up better. After the first day of sightseeing, my toes were bloody. Chalking it up to user error I got a huge blister on the pad of my foot the next day. IDK if I'm going to even keep them for errand running at this point. So cute but not functional. Originally comfortable when I slipped them on but after about an hour that ""cloud foam"" is more like fabric between you and the pavement."
Adidas,1,"Loved the color and material but this design is thoughtlessly executed. The size is true but the opening for your foot is too small and offers no stretch whatsoever to get your ankle in. For a pair of running shoes, I would expect them to fit snugly but still allow my whole foot in! Had to return because I was faced with either cutting a slit to let my foot in or walking around uncomfortably with my heel crushing the back. I’m sad about it, I was looking forward to these!"
Adidas,1,Most uncomfortable. No arch support at all. It as if I’m walking on the bare ground. Hurts
Adidas,1,Most unsupportive shoe ever. Cute and a little comfy for casual wear but not for daily work on your feet. Felt mostly like wearing a house slipper.
Adidas,1,"My hubby bought me these for Christmas as I needed new ones to work out in.  I have had them on 45 minutes.  They were very comfy for 10 minutes and then it's like the air went out of the tire, they went flat.  They also make me walk on the inside of my heels.  I will keep them and tell my hubby they are great, but I will work out in other better shoes.  He deserves a little happiness."
Adidas,1,"My wife was not pleased with the fit. I plan to send back, however UPS said I need a number, which I don't have."
Adidas,1,"Nice looking shoe in the color I wanted. However, that raised back heel piece is too high and the front piece over the top of foot too long. Couldn’t walk across the room without it rubbing foot and it hurt!
Returned."
Adidas,1,No son muy buenos no se si son originales a la segunda puesta se le escucha un ruido el la suela como si tuviera cosas dentro
Adidas,1,No support
Adidas,1,No support and no traction. My daughter slid and fell in the gym.
Adidas,1,No support at all.
Adidas,1,No support at all.
Adidas,1,No support at all. Feet started having problems after a month I've never had before. Legit irritates me. Would never recommend or buy again. Buy sketchers flies. Don't look as nice but feel so much better. Even my $30 slip ons feel better.
Adidas,1,No support. Not comfortable at all.  Used maybe 4x and threw away.
Adidas,1,"Not comfortable. I wanted to like them, but the sole felt really cheap and squishy, almost like your foot was going through it and hitting the flat ground. They were totally unsupportive and just felt super cheaply made. I walked around in them for about 3 minutes before I quickly decided to return them."
Adidas,1,NOT FOR RUNNING! These shoes are horrible for running.
Adidas,1,"Not impressed. They are light weight but feel cheaply made and so thin I don’t see them lasting. I feel like I may as well run barefoot. No support and the top in the back and front rubs on my ankle so much it’s not just painful but annoying. The soles are so thin that my foot actually hurt on the bottom left shoe. I won’t ever waste the money again. I bought them because I have an old ankle injury with 9 screws and a plate. So higher walled shoes over the ankle hurt. These are great because the sides are so low but not worth it if the rest of my feet hurt because the shoe is no good.

A week later- these dang things have a tongue on the top of the shoe that, after a while feels like a cat tongue on your ankle at the top. It’s freaking terrible. Now I have these weird looking blisters on the ankle. It looks stupid because I tied the tongue down like a British whore & the dang things STILL aren’t comfortable. Frankly I’d rather go barefoot. Shame on you for sucking adidas. Our love affair is over."
Adidas,1,Not sized correctly
Adidas,1,Once finally in the shoe it fit. But the opening in which you put your foot into the shoe is WAY TOO SMALL I cannot wear these. Waste of money
Adidas,1,"Out of all the Adidas I own these are the worst ones
The support is nothing like the other cloud foams  I own and they are probably the worst comfort ones that I have and they run small
not only that but I paid $69 for them and apparently a week later they were on sale for $49 so that’s even awful whoever is selling these

beware!!!!"
Adidas,1,poor quality. Stripeson the ONE side (exactly the other side had NO stripes) came off within days. Support wears down within days. They were light which is a plus to an extent but not supportive for long term use. Highly Dissatisfied with this purchase.
Adidas,1,Poorly made shoe. Cheap knock off
Adidas,1,"Pretty little shoe, isn't it?  Not overly expensive.  But it's a walking shoe---with no support?  I feel betrayed."
Adidas,1,Pretty sure this product is not actually made by Adidas!
Adidas,1,Product came ripped
Adidas,1,Purchased a “Used-Like New” pair of these adidas for my wife. Thinking “like new” meant it looks brand new.  It looked more like it had been worn a couple of weeks then sent back. Shoe was comfortable but I don’t like being sold something with a very inaccurate description
Adidas,1,"Purchased because they were cute, reasonably priced and had good reviews. Unfortunately, they run large (I’d recommend sizing down a half size) and have ZERO support. Especially no lateral support. I would definitely return these if I hadn’t taken the tags off. If you’re buying them for style, you should be fine. But do not purchase for workouts or running."
Adidas,1,"Really like these Adidas and looks cute! But for walking, my feet started to hurt and the the memory foam isn’t very comfy, very slight memory foam!"
Adidas,1,"Really not comfortable... big toe seems to roll off the bottom of the shoe, and my feet aren’t that white... the tongue of the shoe doesn’t move and caused big irritation after very short work out."
Adidas,1,received shoes that were used.  Bottoms dirty and toe are stretched out.  Paid for new shoes at new pricing.  Be careful and make sure to check what you receive.
Adidas,1,Returned fit to big which is weird because adidas is usually a small fit!! Also didn’t like the style of the back of shoe!! A no go here!!
Adidas,1,"Returning this product! Too hard to put on. I don't have big feet, but this product just isn't worth the time and effort just to put on a pair of shoes. I want to be able to come and go fast! Thanks anyways!"
Adidas,1,Runs small! Size up at least a half size. This pink color is odd too. Not pink and not lavender. I returned and didn’t re-order.
Adidas,1,Shoe laces are not as the photo shows. Long and have to be tied.
Adidas,1,Shoes arrived with a dent on the top left shoe. I returned it right away.
Adidas,1,Shoes came from seller dirty and obviously already worn. I have to pay the shipping coat to return dirty shoes. Will not purchase from this seller again.
Adidas,1,"Shoes does not  have a tongue to open up to get foot in.  Eyelets
Laces not finished.  Too narrow.  Did like the pull up loops.  I like the soft knit exterior.  I expected more from adidas.  Have used their brand for a long time; probably not going to purchase again."
Adidas,1,So comfortable for walking
Adidas,1,"So disappointed, this is my third pair of adidas that I have bought that have gotten a hole in the bottom on the foot. I bought these a month ago and they are already ruined along with having externally blistered feet."
Adidas,1,So tight and no stretch so I couldn’t even try them on. The hole to put your foot In was so small and tight
Adidas,1,Super unimpressed. Very narrow. No cushion. Should not be listed as a running shoe.
Adidas,1,"That are terrible to try and get on. They are so tight and I thought you didn't have to tie them but u do, but its only for show. I would return them but had them over a week and wore them for the first time."
Adidas,1,The aero pink/aero pink/white came as the lilac color that I already have. These are not the aero pink cloudfoams. Upset. Returning.
Adidas,1,"The box seemed weird and the inner sole does not say Adidas anywhere as shown in the photos. Upon closer inspection, the fabric is cut weird and inconsistently, and the stitching is poor. I will be returning these. Disappointed in Amazon."
Adidas,1,The color is perfect. The sneaker itself not so perfect. It does not have a real opening so it's difficult to put on. In fact I haven't even put it on yet because I would need a shoehorn. The shoe horn should be placed free in each box.  I'm very disappointed with the faux  opening .
Adidas,1,The construction of these shoes is terrible. They also seem to run 2 sizes to small. It looks very much like this is a counterfeit shoe.
Adidas,1,"The heel support is massively tall.  Catches pants with every step.  Shoes are far too narrow, my entire pinky toe is off the sole.  No cushioning... not cloud like at all. Would return if I could."
Adidas,1,The insole in this shoe had zero support. I hate this shoe. My feet hurt after walking in them. I like the look of them but that is all.  I regret this purchase. I would return if they didn’t get a bit dirty on the first wear.
Adidas,1,The most comfortable shoes I’ve ever purchased. I’m tempted to buy more pairs and stash them away just in case they ever get discontinued.
Adidas,1,The opening where you slide your foot in is sewn SMALL. My daughter is tiny and could not get her slender foot through the tiny opening. Disappointed because she owns 2 other pairs of these shoes and loves them. She really likes the color. Returning these.
Adidas,1,The picture the shoes look black which I was expecting.  When I received they are a brighter blue.
Adidas,1,"The SECOND these were put on, the heel strap tore right off. They are poorly made. Not authentic....."
Adidas,1,The shoe doesn't run true to size AT ALL. It is two sizes too small and there is not tongue. It's hard to even get your fit in it at all! Weird.
Adidas,1,"The shoe fits EXACTLY to my size (6.5), i think it would have been better to size up to a 7.  Thankfully the stretchiness of the shoe allows some give and its just fine. Love my clean white shoes. Also comfortable."
Adidas,1,"The shoe is falling apart, literally seams are unraveling and only a month half old"
Adidas,1,"The shoes are cute, but not particularly comfortable. My feet hurt after just a few hours on my feet. I'm a new nurse looking for Dansko alternatives. Still haven't found shoes where my feet don't hurt at the end of a shift."
Adidas,1,The shoes ran small cause I wear a size 8 in women and these were a little to exact
Adidas,1,The shoes were nice but the packaging was damaged - which makes it look bad for a gift to someone else. Presentation is everything when gifting and this is an example of not doing it right. The picture only shows one side of the damaged box.
Adidas,1,"The siding of the three stripes started to come off after one day of wearing them for just a few hours. My feet hurt from wearing theses shoes, and it’s not as comfortable as my other cloudfoam adidas. I’m pretty disappointed."
Adidas,1,the sizes are not even close to the standard size of shoes this shoe is made really small compared to other of same brand
Adidas,1,"The soles are comfortable, but the exposed stitching near the ankle rubs, and makes them unsuitable for extended wear. You could wear higher socks, but they should probably just fix the exposure."
Adidas,1,"The tongue is hard, digs into your ankle. A blister or sore waiting to happen"
Adidas,1,"There is no support in these. I work at a gym and bought these hoping they’d be great for spending hours on your feet moving, I was so wrong. I’ve had to stop in the middle of my shift to change shoes and now will not be wearing them for more than an hour at a time."
Adidas,1,There’s a bubble in the left shoe. Very unhappy with product. Cheaply made and bad customer service.
Adidas,1,"There's zero stretch to this material, which is surprising, considering the design. Returned them immediately because getting them on was too difficult. Wound up returning these and ordering the Alphabounce, which fit great."
Adidas,1,"These ""Adidas"" are FAKE! The stripes are peeling off and you can tell they are tape."
Adidas,1,"These are advertised as the cloudfoam, they even say it on the sides, but they're definitely not. They're just regular memory foam and I can definitely tell the difference between them and my blue pair. They even say different things inside. The black pair I bought here says Adidas memory foam. The blue pair I bought in the store said Adidas cloud foam. The black pair feels tight on my feet and offers no real support. The blue pair fits great and I love walking around in them. How is this possible when they're supposed to be the same shoes in different colors? I got the black ones for easy workout shoes and I hate wearing them. I wore them to work one where I stand up all day and oh boy, did I regret that."
Adidas,1,"these are extremely cheap feeling and thin, not like the Adidas I have bought in the actual store."
Adidas,1,"These are fake adidas. I bought them thinking they would be like the other cloudfoam sneakers I have, but after comparing the two and looking this sneaker up on the official adidas website, I realized it was a knock-off."
Adidas,1,"These are not authentic Adidas. They arrived in a heavily damaged box which implies they were used or second rate since the outside package was not damaged.

The shoes are poorly made with glue clearly visible and virtually no padding in the footbed. I honestly believe these shoes would rip if you even attempted to run in them."
Adidas,1,These are not comfortable at all
Adidas,1,These are not for running.
Adidas,1,"These are not real Adidas cloudfoams. I have many pairs of reals ones, and these aren't it. Also the box is very clearly a black box with a vinyl Adidas label on it.

Returned."
Adidas,1,"These are positioned as a running shoe, and are far from it.  I've had them for two months, and they are completely worn down.  I use them for ordinary walks, 4 times a week.  They have very thin soles, and are at best, a fashion type shoe.  I regret the purchase."
Adidas,1,"These are super cute. The size runs true. They slip on easily. That's it for the good things. This shoe has zero support, and the cushioning leaves a lot to be desired. I wanted these to work , because they look so great but after an hour of wearing my feet were hurting. Sadly I am returning them."
Adidas,1,"These are the worst tennis shoes I've bought. I love ADIDAS shoes. The foam, I can feel literally every rock when walking in gravel."
Adidas,1,These feel completely different from my other cloud foam adidas sneakers Less support. They look cheap and fake
Adidas,1,"These have to be knockoffs. Adidas is known for quality and they would never produce a shoe so poorly made. I ended up ordering from the Adidas website, so I can have the authentic product. Don’t waste your money with this seller."
Adidas,1,These shoes are definitely not good for workouts that require a lot of jumping or running movements. They do not feel secure and felt like I couldn’t put as much effort out as they feel like they would slip off. Love the color the style but definitely not a workout shoe for me... guess run errands shoes.
Adidas,1,"These shoes are impossible to put on.  They fit fine once I get them on, by what a miserable exprience struggling with them. i should have returned them, my bad.  Never again."
Adidas,1,These shoes are not good if you have plantar fasciitis.  I work on my feet all day and my heels are stinging by the time I come home and that is doing just a 5 hr time. It's only for fashion guys!!
Adidas,1,These shoes are pathetic. After some wks of using it for my workout it started to hurt my heel extremely bad to the point where I was and still am in immense pain while walking.
Adidas,1,"These shoes are so poorly made. I wanted to love them . They look nice , until you put them on. They are wide all the way around the ankle to where you can stick your hand in.  There was zero support  in the toe end. The sole doesn't even come all the way to the tip of the toe. I could literally feel the rubber on the bottom of the shoe. Don't waste your money."
Adidas,1,"these shoes are trash and i do not recommend anyone buying them, they're knock off Adidas."
Adidas,1,These shoes are very poorly/cheaply made. Hard to believe they are Adidas. They have ZERO support. These should NOT be advertised as a running shoe. I walked around the mall and after 20 minutes it felt like I was walking barefoot.
Adidas,1,"These shoes arrived to me in used condition. The soles are dirty and scuffed and the shoe laces have been tied tight. The shape of the shoe has definitely been worn on a foot for awhile. Even if they had been sent in new condition, they are still pretty uncomfortable. Sending back asap."
Adidas,1,These shoes came and look like they are fake addis shoes. They have a weird color around the soles make glue and are just miss colored. They also have no Addis lable inside. And may have been wore the sole has worn Marks. I've very disappointed.
Adidas,1,These shoes do not match adidas quality. The quality and fit is not consistent with the adidas brand. I have worn them 3-5 times and am very disappointed with this product and the money I spent.
Adidas,1,These shoes I just bought for my girl are stinky and not anything like the pictures on amazon! I am very discussed by this vendor. COVID just came to my home
Adidas,1,These shoes looked very nice but I couldn’t get my foot in like at all! The opening isn’t very large and has no stretch my feet aren’t even wide or anything like that just couldn’t get them in.
Adidas,1,"These shoes made my feet hurt after wearing them for my 30 min workout. I normally wear a size 10, so I would size up!!"
Adidas,1,These shoes ripped after only 4 uses. Total waste of money. Do not buy these shoes if you intend to wear them at all.
Adidas,1,"These sneakers are advertised as a running shoe, and they most certainly are NOT a running shoe.  There is absolutely no support and nothing to make your foot feel secured in the shoe.  I took these sneakers on a 9 mile walk (which I do often in a different shoe), needless to say, my feet hurt for 3 weeks after.  HORRIBLE, DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES!!!"
Adidas,1,These sneakers are cheaply made. They have absolutely no support. The tongue is sewn into place which means the laces are difficult to tighten. I guess the reason for all of the 5 stars is the cheap price. It's not worth it folks. Mine are on their way back to Amazon.
Adidas,1,"These sneakers feels like you are walking barefoot on the ground. The sole is soooooo thin. If that’s what you like, by all means buy this shoe.  But there’s no way I could run in these. Absolutely no shock absorption. Returned them."
Adidas,1,These were cheaply made and not worth 49.99 at all. My son got the same exact shoe at Costco for $25 and he said”You really got ripped off
Adidas,1,"These were knock offs! The hit my ankle causing blisters. I got them because I’m a nurse and I needing something I could wear at work and that clearly won’t be happening. The quality is so poor. Compared to my friend who got the same exact shoe in store, very clear differences. DEFINITELY A KNOCK OFF!"
Adidas,1,"They are good looking shoes, but lack the support for walking/ running. I wore them for workout twice and since then I am in a lot of pain."
Adidas,1,They are really really bad. I have never seen as poor product as this. IT SEEMS FAKE
Adidas,1,"They look cheaply made, knock off?"
Adidas,1,They ripped after wearing them 3 times!!! Super unhappy and either want a refund or another pair that won’t rip.  Not ok!!!
Adidas,1,"They sent me a second hand worn out product. The soles of the shoe were worn out. I purchased the white in it which is an excellent wear but the black one, it seems like both the sole and the foam inside was worn out. It's really annoying and I will not be buying another Adidas product."
Adidas,1,They suck for working out in and the quality isn’t good at all. Super over priced for what they said they should be. Not worth it. Wish I could get a refund on them. Going back to my old running shoes.
Adidas,1,"They was not white like i ordered, it was a very very light blue. Disappointed."
Adidas,1,"They were really hard to get on. There is a ""tab"" at the back of the heel for pulling them on, but I don't want to be bothered with a shoehorn for tennis shoes."
Adidas,1,This didn't fit. I returned it and never got reimbursed. I should have resold them on-line at offer up.
Adidas,1,"this is basically a slip on shoe, and it's really hard to get your foot inside it. I would not recommend it."
Adidas,1,This is not a $60-70 shoe. It’s more like an Adidas outlet shoe that would go for $39.99.
Adidas,1,"This is the worst shoe ever! I feel like Walmart shoes are better than this. I bought these for walking because they are “running shoes”, but they completely hurt my ankles, toes, shins, and Achilles. I will not be purchasing again."
Adidas,1,"This seller is sending product defect shoes, or knock offs. If you look closely, the shoes are not even the same. One of them has glue aroun the edge of the sole. And the sole are not even the same hahaha. The front of the sole is very different from both shoes."
Adidas,1,"This shoe arrived and I loved the look of them, but it was January so I put the box in the closet and forgot about them. In March I took them out to wear and I couldn’t get them on. I wear a size 10. These were more like a size 8.5. They said they were a size 10, but they weren’t."
Adidas,1,This shoe is comfortable at first but The “Cloud foam” is already wearing away from the shoe. I just got them Sunday and today is Wednesday!!!! I haven’t ran in them yet!!smh
Adidas,1,"This shoe is not the size it claims to be. It's at least one size bigger.
I expected more from a known brand like Adidas.
Very disappointed."
Adidas,1,"This shoe is so untrue to its size, the front squished and flung me so hard into the ground I broke my front tooth, nearly broke my nose, and had to go to the ER."
Adidas,1,"This shoe is very flat and next to no cushion.  The tall back gets annoyingly caught in your pants constantly.  I already wore them, so I can’t return, but I would not recommend.  Not comfortable at all."
Adidas,1,"This shoe looks great, is light weight and super comfortable. I ALWAYS wear a size 10 in Nike, but a 10 was too big in this shoe...a 9 1/2 was perfect!"
Adidas,1,"This shoe ran a little small. Worst yet they  would only give a credit on an amazon gift card, not a credit on my credit card. Not what i expect from AMAZON."
Adidas,1,"This shoe was a knockoff.
Amazon used to do a good job verifying their products, but I have received two fake adidas in a row. Poorly made, and each shoe was different!
What a waste of my time"
Adidas,1,This show is nothing more than for hanging around the house. Absolutely 0 support. After just a few hours of wearing them in the house my feet hurt. Super disappointed.
Adidas,1,Tight hurts my foot
Adidas,1,Tongue is stiff and hard - rubs the front of my ankle
Adidas,1,Too narrow on top
Adidas,1,Too small And they don’t offer a bigger size to try on
Adidas,1,"Too small, for the size we ordered"
Adidas,1,Two shoes came in for the same foot.  I used wrong return method and now I can't return or use the shoes that were paid for.
Adidas,1,Ugly
Adidas,1,Unexpectedly disappointed BECAUSE the order was ABRUPTLY CANCELED the night before expected arrival! Awful!
Adidas,1,"unfortunately the product arrived with dirt on the bottom of the shoes. They have CLEARLY been worn before. They came in a non-adidas box with a sticker stating “Your items have been reboxed to ensure they arrive meeting your expectations. THIS PRODUCT IS BRAND NEW, NEVER WORN. Original box was damaged.” Haha. The original box was damaged AND someone definitely wore them."
Adidas,1,"Vertically these were very small, wouldn't fit."
Adidas,1,Very big all over!!  even though I ordered my size
Adidas,1,Very cheap looking shoe. Do not let the reviews fool you. I’ve been scarred to go shoe shopping in person and gambled by shopping online. They offer literally no arch support and I’m surprised they are even Adidas. Just save up another 50 and buy a sneaker that will last longer that the flu season.
Adidas,1,Very cheap. Flimsy material. Runs about a half size too big. They have almost no shape. Returning. Disappointed.
Adidas,1,Very cheaply made. I got these for my kids and they lasted for a couple weeks. I had to buy new shoes for all my kids again.
Adidas,1,Very comfortable and cute! But I will be sending them back because of the dark stain on one if the shoes.  I was very disappointed 😞
Adidas,1,Very comfortable and lightweight!
Adidas,1,Very comfy lightweight shoe but fits about a size too big. Go a size down. Had to return.
Adidas,1,"Very disappointed. They say they’re size 11, but they are mis sized. Need to return, but missed the return window. Didn’t try on until yesterday. This is my 3rd pair because I love them. The others were the size it said. Just try on as soon as you get them."
Adidas,1,Very little heel support. Definitely not for running. Don’t think it’s original adidas sneakers. They look very cheap. Definitely not worth buying .
Adidas,1,"Very small, uncomfortable, hard to got on, regret buying them"
Adidas,1,"Very thin soles, so not very comfortable. These shoes are cheaply made and poor quality."
Adidas,1,Very uncomfortable and too large. Even tried a size down and was still too big
Adidas,1,Way to big based on printed size.
Adidas,1,We ordered these using prime wardrobe. Our daughter said they were the most uncomfortable shoes she had ever worn. We sent them back
Adidas,1,"What happened, Adidas? Where is the older Cloudform shoe that is truly comfortable?  This ""Pure"" style is completely inferior!  The shoe is not comfortable at all.  I am returning the shoe."
Adidas,1,Will never order through this company again. Ordered wife shoes for a Christmas gift only to have the company completely cancel the order several days after Christmas. Don’t expect anything different.
Adidas,1,"Wore these 1 time and will need to return. The lip (I guess that is the name) of the shoe, near the laces, rubbed the tops of my ankles raw! I couldn't wait to get home and get them off!"
Adidas,1,"Worst running/walking/workout shoes I have ever worn. The inside of the show is made with a foam that does not breathe. The seams are jagged and if the shoes are worn without socks cause irritation immediately and blisters quickly. They have zero traction, I have slipped many times. They also have virtually no support. After wearing these for four weeks for evening walks my lower back and feet can take no more. I can’t return them but hopefully can warn you against buying them."

Adidas,1,Zero stars. Received a counterfeit item that fits nothing like the real thing. I know because I have another pair at home. What a disappointment.
Adidas,1,Zero support. Not for exercise.
Asics,1,*
Asics,1,1st the shoes are to small And I've contacted  The seller still wIting for lable and refund.
Asics,1,"Agonizingly painful shoe. Completely inflexible sole. Zero arch support. Hard as a rock, absolutely no cushion whatsoever. I'm furious with asics for inventing this sadistically terrible shoe. I only ordered online because I trusted the brand. I'm flabbergasted that anyone was able to even use it. My year-old ripped to shreds new balance shoes have more cushion left than these have brand new. I guess it's my fault for being stupid enough to buy shoes online, but you know, pandemic, can't try anything on in my city..."
Asics,1,"appearance nice, fit was good, did not hold up and was uncomfortable from day one. Should have returned them."
Asics,1,Arrived 2 weeks late with an INK TAG ON THEM!!!!!
Asics,1,"As you see big toe is getting holes! This is after 3-4 wears. Bought 3 pairs, wore 2 and both tore up"
Asics,1,"At first the shoe was great very comfortable, I had them less then 2 months when the fabric wore out on the back of my heal/ankle and it cut open the back of my ankle on both shoes."
Asics,1,"Barely worn and falling apart. I got these delivered in December and didn’t start wearing them until March because here in Minnesota it was still snow boot weather. I love the fit and feel of these shoes, but after 2 months, they’re coming apart."
Asics,1,Bought 10/15/2020 and my toe already broke thru. Took my older ASICS over a year for this to happen.
Asics,1,"BOUGHT THESE TO REPLACE ASICS GEL VENTURE 6, SAME SIZE - AND MY TOE IS RUBBING END OF THE SHOE AND EVEN THOUGH I PURCHASED WIDE - THESE ARE MUCH NARROWER.  SUSPECT THAT THESE MIGHT BE FAKE....BUT THAT IS JUST A SPECULATION. RETURNING IMMEDIATELY."
Asics,1,Cheap and made like crap
Asics,1,Clearly one shoe has been worn in a very dirty place.  There is dirt and other stuff stuck to it.
Asics,1,"Could not keep the shoes, they came with the safety tag attached to them. Worst, I had to pay for the shipping of exchange ones."
Asics,1,"Description does not match product.  I ordered a half size up to be safe and shoe was still small.
No arch support as described and not comfortable."
Asics,1,"Did not care for this shoe. It hurt my feet after walking.  I have got this brand  before  and like it . This show did not work out for me as well as some of the other Asics have . I am on my feet for at least 8 hours  if not more ,but not a good shoe for that."
Asics,1,Did not fit as expected.  Material different than anticipated from my last pair.  Returned.
Asics,1,Did not fit; Amazon has accepted my return quickly.  Everything is OK now.
Asics,1,Didn't care for this shoe. It is past the return window so I cannot do anything. My foot slides in this shoe when running causing it to hurt.
Asics,1,Doesn't have much support or cushion.
Asics,1,El artículo nunca me llegó necesito reembolso del dinero
Asics,1,El producto de mala calidad no parecen originales. Quisiera que me devolvieran mi dinero. Han tenido poco uso pues estamos en invierno y solo los he usado en el gym
Asics,1,Fit is nice but I’m disappointed because the picture looks lavender / gray and these are a dark black.
Asics,1,Good fitting shoe nice look comfortable great walker. However poorly made stitching is separating at toe. Attempted to email zappers with pics twice no response
Asics,1,Had these for 2 weeks. Made my legs hurt so bad. Would not let me return. Poor customer service and disappointed in Asics.
Asics,1,Had these shoes for about 2 months now and they already have holes in them. Disappointing with the money I spent I would have thought they were better quality.
Asics,1,"Had to send back, even though I ordered the correct size for me, the shoes were not the size stated."
Asics,1,Hands down the most painful shoes I've ever owned. No cushion or support.
Asics,1,"heel cup and arch seem too close then toe box is too wide, not enough padding to sole for high intensity exercises, plan to return"
Asics,1,Horribly uncomfortable for walking indoors. My feet were killing me after a few hours. Hope to return.
Asics,1,"I always buy ASICS. Thought I’d try a new version. Didn’t like them.  Shoelaces are so thin, they won’t stay tied."
Asics,1,"I am a server in a high volume restaurant, I average 15-20k steps a shift and work 5 shifts a week. The shoe is severely lacking in arch and ankle support. It's also very bulky and not very stylish. Makes my size 6.5 foot look very large."
Asics,1,"I am disappointed in the quality of the shoe. It feels nothing like an ASICS shoe. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was a cheap knockoff and not a
There is no arch support and the sole isn't removable so I can't even replace it with a quality sole.
I love my old ASICS but after this experience I won't buy ASICS running shoes again."
Asics,1,I barely had them a month before they ripped. They are extremely comfortable but don’t last a long time.
Asics,1,"I bought asics running shoes over 5 years ago, so so so comfortable - still wearing them even though im starting to wear hole in the mesh fabric by my big toe.  I ordered on line thinking they would fit/look same. they so not same sneaker - totally diff fit/look, and ill be returning"
Asics,1,"I bought the wide width, and the tongue does not cover my foot. My foot fits inside ok, but you can see my sock between the tongue, and shoe.
I don't know how they feel to run. I've recovering from an injury, but I don't know if I will keep them that long."
Asics,1,I bought these as a gift for someone and they told me they are defective.  The one shoe has no arch support and the other shoe has a piece of plastic that digs into her right foot on the left side of the toe box.  Unfortunately her birthday was in May and the return window closed.
Asics,1,I bought these for running but they are VERY uncomfortable.  I have a pair of Asics now that I love but these are terrible.  I thought I was getting a good deal but not at all.
Asics,1,"I bought these in December, but just started wearing them in mid-January. The right shoe has already developed a hole in the toe. Very disappointed. I'm only walking a few hours a week and running my dog in agility a couple of days per week. My last pair of cheapo $15 New Balance I got at TJ Maxx lasted 9 months.....I expected more out of these shoes."
Asics,1,"I bought these shoes based on the reviews but am not happy with the purchase.
These shoes aren't particularly comfortable, they aren't very attractive and look / feel VERY cheap.  Honestly, I've bought better quality shoes from PayLess.  I will keep them for yard work and such, too late to return them, but I'm going to be purchasing a better quality / more comfortable pair of shoes for walking.  At this price point, I expected more from these sneakers."
Asics,1,"I bought these shoes for work. I am an RN. They are horrible. I hate them. they are ugly, fit too narrow, and hurt my feet."
Asics,1,"I bought these shoes in January and a week ago (mid May) they both had holes in them. They got holes in the toe of each shoe and I've never had that happen in shoes before. I'm very disappointed. I've had other Asics that have been better but after paying that much for shoes you'd think they would last longer than 4 1/2-5 months. I didn't even wear them every day. I used them when working out, going around town (sometimes), and when hiking outside."
Asics,1,I did not keep these running shoes. The insole of the shoe was not comfortable enough for me
Asics,1,"I did'n't realize the shoes is so hard and not comfortable.  I only wore one day, my left little toe was squeezed to red and felt pain."
Asics,1,I dislike because they are not a comfort shoe as advertised.... pain in my feet.  Very disappointed..
Asics,1,I dislike the style of the shoes and it wasn't comfortable at all.
Asics,1,I do not like memory foam for bone support...sadly they changed the material
Asics,1,I fell in love with Asics about 3 yrs ago and I never had an issue...because my miles have increased I decided to get a new pair before the end of my last pair which I purchased in 2019....I got this pair just weeks before stay at home for implemented and then I had surgery which also made me unable to run...I was only medically cleared three weeks ago and started back walking which is why I am surprised that when I started to use it I got a whole by the toe box....now I still like the brand but this is unacceptable quality
Asics,1,"I had heard good things about these shoes so I thought I'd give them a try.  I can usually get by with an 8 1/2 in New Balance, but ordered the 8 1/2 wide in these to be safe.  WAY to narrow!  Sending them back...  ETA:  I reordered in a 9 1/2 W and I thought they fit okay so I wore them.  Still too narrow, after my first real run I got blisters but they were okay for everyday until I noticed the holes in the back of the heel's on both shoes today.  Today is April 4, I got them Feb 22 and have not worn them more than 20 times.  (Sorry, but I can't figure out how to post pictures.)  $10 Walmart specials last me 3 - 4 months!!!  I am SO disappointed in ASICS.  :("
Asics,1,I had to pay for shipping to send them back. I don't have a printer so I couldn't print the return label. I tried wearing the shoes around the house but they are just to tight I really need a bigger size. I cant even give them away because they don't fit anyone that I know :( Just stuck with a pair of new shoes.
Asics,1,I had to send them back. I did not like the lack of support for my plantar fasciitis.
Asics,1,I had to twist my knees and now I can't walk just to get these rock of sneakers on!
Asics,1,"I hate these shoes. They squeak when you walk, no matter the surface. I should have sent them back but was too busy."
Asics,1,"I have a huge hole in the fabric on top of one of the shoes, only two months after I got them. I only wear them once a week or so, so let’s guess 8-10 times?! The quality is clearly not good, I’d avoid this product."
Asics,1,I have been buying these for YEARS. It's the only shoe that doesn't hurt and helps my back.... for some reason? They changed the toe box or something on the front of the shoe and it MURDERED my big toe/nail bed. I can't even wear them! Hoping they change that back with the 8 or something. Until then.... I will buy 6's and look around for another brand? Shoe? Not sure!
Asics,1,I have been wearing Asics for years and have never gotten a blister. These gave me a blister on my little toe after running a short distance. Do not recommend. I plan to go back and buy the Asics venture 5 which were great.
Asics,1,"I have bought this shoe many times I literally got them on the 20th to replace my old pair that I got in store but I’m 10 days in and these are killing my feet my I have plantar fasciitis and this brand has always been a life saver (I’m on my feet 10-12 hours a day at work) but these shoes had cushion for a few days but now I just feel
Like I’m standing on hard cement im definitely not going to be purchasing online anymore I just don’t feel like this is the same quality I get when I buy at the store"
Asics,1,"I have bought three pairs of these Asics Gel-7 shoes for my pre-teen daughter. The first pair barely got worn (estimated 4 months) before she outgtew them. This first pair was the Amazon purchase at the end of 2019. Tge followingvtwo purchases were from another retailer online on 2020. The second pair (originally bought for me but were too small), she wore about twice a week since the beginning of school. I ordered another pair for her to use in gym class at school. This pink and black third pair she has worn nearly every day for five full months.
Size, fit, and comfort were spot-on and thess were great shoes until they started coming apart at the seams, soles, and the material has started to shread.  I've not seem a pair of shoes fall apart so terribly and fast before.
I've bought Asics brand shoes for over a decade and never experienced this level of disgust in their product. The grey/ice blue pair (bought second and worn twice a week or so indoors when her class gets to have gym) has busted threads on the toe and the mesh material is ripping apart.  The pink/black daily wear pair has the toes exposed because the top has completely come undone and the soles are detaching.  I've never seen a pair of shoes disengage like this, and I've raised an active boy into adulthood!
Parents and anyone who actually uses their tennis/running shoes should take a pass on these! If buying for the kid, know you will end up replacing them before the school year ends. Pics are provided to show extreme wear in short-term both for light wear and daily wear."
Asics,1,I have had 10-12 pairs of asics in the last 7 years.  These are the worst laces ever! I may returns the shoes because they are so horrible
Asics,1,"I have had these less than two weeks!! Walked 60 miles in them, and I already have a hole in the toe!! Yes, I keep my nails trimmed short! Very disappointed, not nearly as well made as the gel venture 6"
Asics,1,"I have not worn these much, because within a few weeks of purchase the stitching at the toe started coming apart. I don't know if it is a design issue (not enough room in the toe box) or if the quality of the thread used is subpar."
Asics,1,"i have purchased 2 other pairs, same size same model  last pair was marked the right size but way off
 more like an 8 rather than 7 1/2"
Asics,1,"I have purchased about seven pairs of Asics and they have all been great except this pair. The foam at the right heal compresses every time I put the shoe on, and won’t bounce back.poor quality control, very disappointing."
Asics,1,I have several pairs of this sneaker. I ordered my usual size and when I put them on either they were mislabeled as a 7 1/2 or the fit has changed. My toes were squished up against the front of the sneaker.  The laces are also now very cheap looking and don’t really tie unless you double knot them.  Very disappointed because my old ASICS are the best.
Asics,1,I have wore many pairs of ASICS always wear the same size these run very small and had to pay to send them back!
Asics,1,I like the fast delivery and the good quality of the product.
Asics,1,"I normally don’t write reviews, this is my very first one. Just after 3 weeks of wearing my feet currently look like this🤦🏽‍♀️ OUCH. Will not be purchasing from this company again. The padding absolutely sucks, this is my first experience getting calluses on my feet and it’s horrible."
Asics,1,"I normally love ASICS. I bought these and found them very stiff when I first put them on. I thought maybe they would ""break in"" over time so I decided to keep them. I regret not returning them. They also ride low on the heel. I would not recommend this shoe"
Asics,1,"I ordered a 12 wide, but received a 12 regular instead. Shoes were too tight I had to send them back."
Asics,1,I ordered a 5 wide shoe. A regular 5 came in. Not even close to fitting. Very disappointed and upset. They even left the original tag saying that the size is a regular 5.
Asics,1,"I ordered a wide width and the tag on inside of shoe states wide, but it fits as a medium. I also thought the gel shoe would be more cushioning, but it's not."
Asics,1,I ordered black tennis shoes and I received navy blue ones.
Asics,1,I ordered these awhile ago and just started wearing them. I have about 20 pairs of Asics and love them. I think these are bootleg Asics. They don't feel anything like all my other Asics. I even have 2 pair of the same models. I wish I had returned them when I received them.
Asics,1,"I ordered these in wide width. The cut was awful; very stingy and narrow. Also, the laces are cheap and flat. Very unfriendly to the hands. I waited too long to try them out and I missed the return window. Not a good value at any price."
Asics,1,I ordered these shoes twice once in a 8 wide and next time in a 8.5.  Both shoes were sized wrong and both felt right.  Not comfortable!  Won't order this shoe again!
Asics,1,I ordered WIDE and they are still to narrow. If you need wide shoes stay away from these
Asics,1,"I own several pairs of ASICS and these are not true to size. I ended up with bruising on my toes after wearing them to work, I’ve never had this issue with any of my other ASICS. I wish I could return them."
Asics,1,I purchased these because they were Amazon’s favorite. 2nd pair of ASICS. Love my currant pair but I’ve had them a year so I figured it was time for a new pair. These are horrible!!! I feel no support what so ever. They feel hard and cheap! Need to return them!
Asics,1,"I purchased these shoes in January 2020, but with the quarantine have not worn them much. It's now early September,  and the stitching is falling apart. There is actually a whole on the left side of the shoe. If I could give these shoe a negative score I would!!"
Asics,1,"I read all the reviews and thought I would be fine with a wide width. The shoes are cut slightly small. It is as if the manufacturers did not leave enough fabric for sewing. The side reinforcement bands have caused a pressure point on my foot and hurts my side bones. I am hoping the shoe will stretch and become more comfortable over time. Shoe seems to be well made, but definitely a 1/2 size to small. If these shoes are made overseas I would come back to US and have us make them correctly! ! ! !"
Asics,1,I received these shoes with a badly frayed shoelace.  I know it seems petty but that shouldn't happen on a new purchase. I contacted Asics through Amazon asking for a replacement pair of laces and all they offered was a link to an online shoelace store for me to pay to replace them. I'll never buy Asics products again.
Asics,1,"I recieved these and gave been really excited to wear, unfortunately I never even got to try them on they were covered in HAIR. The worst part is that you cant tell if its human hair or animal hair. Disgusting."
Asics,1,I returned these shoes because they were too wide for me. I usually order a 12 narrow but ASIC isn’t making narrows any longer so I gave these a try. I found a different ASIC that fits me much better in the width. This shoe was stiff compared to regular running shoes. I  think it was labeled a trail shoe.
Asics,1,"I thought I was buying the regular running shoes. However, once I changed the color option it changed to the trail runners -i didn't notice before purchasing- they look great but are much harder than I was expecting. I have worn asics for years and have always worn the same size. These ones are harder around the toes and I have had problems bending my foot at the toes (going up on tippy toes) causes a lot of pain. I have only worn them for 2 days and both nights I have taken them off limping. I am now back to my old worn out asics . 1st time I have ever been disappointed in my asics."
Asics,1,I used these as walking shoes and they make my feet cramp every time. I’ve only used them a couple of months and had to stop wearing them because my feet hurt so bad after each walk.
Asics,1,"I usually buy brands like NB, Solomon or Nike. I wanted to try this brand because it had so many reviews on amazon. I feel like these shoes do not have enough support for running. in addition to that, these make my feet feel hot, I haven't felt that with my other shoes. Had I not worn other brands, I probably would be okay, because I would have nothing to compare. But having worn other brands I do not recommend this. There are better products available out there.

P.S. I am an intermediate runner."
Asics,1,"I wanted a black pair of comfortable athletic shoes and have a pair of white Asics Gel that I love.  Thought these were close to the same, but I was WRONG!  Tried inserts; even bent and wired them that way, but still aren't comfortable.
Wish I could return them, but I waited too long.  Don't order unless you have the EXACT style; there are so many!"
Asics,1,I wanted to love these; they're cute and Asics are a great brand.  The problem is where the laces end on the top of the foot is stitched in such a way that it is really tight across the top of the foot. Now try and add an orthotic and omg the pain.  So I'm returning them. I'll go back to New Balance
Asics,1,I was very excited about my new running shoes but the shape of it didn’t work for me. After one workout I had bruises and blisters and a vey painful Bunion.
Asics,1,"I’ve been an avid ASICS purchaser for years. After being diagnosed with CRPS in my foot, they were the only shoes I could wear that were tolerable on my foot. Which speaks volumes, because all other shoes are excruciating.

Yet, over the years the quality has significantly declined. I’ve repeatedly noticed that the inside padded portion of the heel will tear, exposing the hard plastic underneath. When this happens, I typically buy a new pair and use the worn ones as shoes for doing yard work. I was okay with this, because I really loved all of my ASICS and felt like I got enough wear from them.

However, this pair literally lasted 2 weeks of walking 3 miles daily on a treadmill (never worn outside) before the padding wore through and the plastic underneath tore open the skin on my heels.  I couldn’t even wear them for yard work after this because the plastic was so sharp. I’m very disappointed to have to spent this amount of money on a pair of walking shoes that I didn’t even put 50 miles on."
Asics,1,I’ve bought many ASICS that are very comfortable but this pair doesn’t doesn’t have much cushion. Probably won’t wear much. Too bad 😕
Asics,1,I’ve had these shoes for less than a month and the seam is ripping along the right big toe. Very disappointed.
Asics,1,I’ve only had these shoes for a couple of months and my big toes are already coming through them. I even ordered them a half size bigger to allow some room when I walk and they’re still wore out. A total disappointment and waste of money. Go for a different brand that stands by their name!
Asics,1,If I could give this product Zero stars I would!!! I got the shoes and there was thick sticky white pads on the inside of the shoes. These are most likely a returned or tampered with shoes. Shame on this company!
Asics,1,If I had the original package I would send them back. They hurt my feet real bad not very comfortable shoes
Asics,1,"I'll start off by saying I have worn out 2 other pairs of Asics shoes and loved them. However, these are extremely tight and fit too snuggly, and they tend to overheat in hot weather. I had blisters on the bottoms of my feet after walking 1 day. And as someone else pointed out, the shoelaces are awful, thin, and tend to cause pain on top of the foot. If you're looking for comfort, these aren't it."
Asics,1,"It gives me no pleasure to write this review as I genuinely really wanted the shoes to fit and be perfect, but sadly they will be returned.  I usually wear a size 7.5 in shoe but with sneakers I am told to size up so I ordered an 8. When I put the shoe on my left foot my toe was touching the top part of shoe no wiggle room, and on the right foot it fit fine. In addition, it fit like a wide width shoe, but I did not select the wide width. The fit and feel of the shoe was not what I was expecting. The only thing right is the color of the shoe. What's sad is I went into Famous Footwear and bought the exact brand and size of a shoe and it fit perfectly. Which is why I felt comfortable ordering this shoe off line. I thought I knew what I was getting. I honestly got the feel I received a defective shoe. How can the right shoe fit like an 8 and the other fit like a 7? I cannot recommend this shoe. I got the black/ piedmont."
Asics,1,"It hurts my heels and knees
I don’t recommend for anyone who has an back, knee or heel injure or pain from any kind
It’ll make it worse"
Asics,1,It would have been nice to have received what I ordered..make sure to really check the size because I ordered a 9 Wide and the box side 9 wide but didnt check the shoe..Shoe size says 9 ...new shoe that I cant wear because its too tight...Ugh I blame the vendor and Amazon.
Asics,1,it's very uncomfortable it doesn't suit for my feet. Dislike them. I still have them there without use
Asics,1,Least comfortable Asics I've ever bought and I've purchased many. I'm very disappointed.
Asics,1,Love the look of the shoe and the fit. But have had less than 2 months and worn maybe 20 times there is already a hole in the right toe. I missed the return window by 3 days so now am out the money. This seems to be an ongoing problem with this brand. Big waste of money.
Asics,1,"My grandmother wore these shoes for a few months and they fell apart. She never abused them, she just wore them when taking short walks around the neighborhood."
Asics,1,"My sneakers were defective, after 5 months of very occasional wear, the interior padding around the heel area became misshapen and gave me a terrible blister. I wrote to Peltz Shoes to alert them to this defect and request a replacement pair, and was really surprised and disappointed when they refused to help me. I will go directly to the brand next time, and do NOT recommend buying from Peltz. Asics has a one-year warranty for all of their shoes which the seller refuses to uphold. BUY DIRECTLY FROM ASICS, NOT FROM PELTZ!"
Asics,1,My toes got crushed wearing these for the first time today. I was disappointed.
Asics,1,Narrow shoes and very little arch support.
Asics,1,No arch support
Asics,1,No padding on insole. Feels like maybe a knock off. Not worth the money.
Asics,1,"No, el.zapato resultó pequeño"
Asics,1,Not a got fit for me. To wide but not enough space for my toes. Never had that issue on any sneakers. Also if you return it you have to pay for shipping.
Asics,1,Not comfortable at all. Painful to stand in for long periods of time.
Asics,1,Not enough foot support
Asics,1,Not happy at all !!!! Received my shoes with an anti theft device attached to them!
Asics,1,"Not nearly as comfortable as many other Asics I’ve had.  Definitely would not buy again, simply not a comfortable shoe."
Asics,1,Not the color shown in the picture used them for a whole day and my feet hurt. Horrible shoe big waste of money!
Asics,1,Not very substantial for me. Wrong choice!☹️
Asics,1,"Not what I expected from this brand.

I ordered shoes from this line two years ago that were amazing,  but these,  the laces are flat and flimsy and catch rather than pulling smoothly.

Second, even with socks,  about an hour of walking results in blisters.  The soles are also incredibly stiff.

True breaking in newer shoes takes time, but I've never had a pair I've been this dissatisfied with.  I won't be buying this brand again."
Asics,1,Not wide enough. Also the company takes along time to refund you.
Asics,1,Nothing like the comfort of a real Asic sneaker my wife has used in the past. Seems like materials used with this specific shoe are just different from what she has had in the past. She tried using them at work and couldn't wear them after 3 shifts as they were very hard and stiff. She gave them to our oldest daughter.
Asics,1,"Nothing like the ptevious gel venture shoes.. they ha e a memory foam like insole, fit small, and feel like a cheap shoe compared to the other gel venture models."
Asics,1,One shoe is too tight and I can not walk in it without pain on the top of my foot where the bottom of the shoe laces are laced through the shoe.
Asics,1,"Our family likes this brand of shoe a lot, it’s very comfortable that’s why we buy them. Sadly however, I’m giving it one star because I’ve only had the shoes a little while and there’s already holes in the part that rubs against my heel which is caused me blisters on several occasions. I reached out to the ASICS company 6 months ago when this happened with my last pair of shoes I got a year ago (and they were supposed to have a year warranty) and they STILL haven’t gotten back to me... They only sent me automated emails blaming the pandemic for not getting back to me and I’ve tried at least 4-5 times now in the last 9 months! Very upset by this and the poor craftsmanship/workmanship/inferior material components..."
Asics,1,Pedi mi talle y son demasiado grandes
Asics,1,Poor quality. I shouldn’t have wasted my money on it. I’ve never had ASICS shoes to come apart.
Asics,1,Poorly made shoe. Hole in fabric by toe after only 6 months! Do not buy this shoe.
Asics,1,"Previously, I gave this shoe 4 stars, but after using them 3 times per week to exercise, I’ve developed a Subungual hematoma.  It is quite painful.  This is caused by the foot box of this shoe being too small.  Buyer beware!  If your second toe is longer than your big toe, do NOT buy these shoes!  I would have given it a negative star if I could.  Recovery time is three to five weeks..."
Asics,1,Product is defective.
Asics,1,Purchased for $48 and had to return due to size. Now priced at $63. Disappointing.
Asics,1,Puse una orden para devolverlo Pero nunca lo devolví aún lo puedo devolver a la Kohl's me gustaría saber si si por favor
Asics,1,Ran on the treadmill with them yesterday and my feet were hurting and very sore and still sore today. I had to soak my feet when I made it home. Very uncomfortable and I’ve never experienced this with another shoe.  I’m going to add some gel inserts to them next time I work out and see if that helps.
Asics,1,Return
Asics,1,Return was fast and easy and the fit was good.
Asics,1,"Right Asics shoe is too small.  Now stuck with shoes,  return expired."
Asics,1,Shoes were damaged
Asics,1,Size 11 did not fit as 11 and the color does not exactly match the color on the picture too masculine too dark. Will have to return it
Asics,1,Size of shoe is no what was expected. My wife toes are in pAin because of the shape of it.
Asics,1,Sizes too small
Asics,1,Sneakers fit but came with ink security tag.
Asics,1,"So disappointed 😞. I’ve worn the exact same ascics series shoe for six years. Buy them every year. For whatever reason, they suddenly were SO narrow. Painful really."
Asics,1,"So small!  I was hoping these shoes would make my feet ""happy"" like my old Asics Gel Venture 5 shoes did.  These shoes are much shorter and wider than my previous shoes.  My old shoes gently cradled my feet while thsee shoes were so much shorter I didn't even try to walk in them.  They fit also felt ""sloppy"" in the heel though  I must admit to having narrow feet though my old shoes fit the heel just fine.In addition, they also didn't look as well made.  I'm happy others have been happy with these shoes but they just didn't work for me."
Asics,1,"Sorry to report I had to return these shoes. They were too small. I’ve worn ASICS for years, but these are not typical of ASICS sizing."
Asics,1,"The black and silver pair is really a deep blue, not quite navy and not even close to black."
Asics,1,"The black/silver choice is not black, it’s navy"
Asics,1,The color is misrepresented
Asics,1,the customer service from this seller is so bad. nothing is worth the hassle.
Asics,1,The item runs narrow and is difficult to return.
Asics,1,The product fit perfect.. I use them to hike and run. Very comfortable .
Asics,1,The product was recommended for plantar fasciitis and it hurts more to wear these shoes than go bare foot.  Tried them several times and still very painful.  Sitting in my closest.  If you have heal spurs do not get.  Probably a good shoe for someone with healthy feet.
Asics,1,The sewing on the top of the shoe has started to ravel. I wear them as a nurse and have had several pair. But never purchased them from Amazon. Very disappointed.
Asics,1,"The shoe design at the top is cutting in and hurting my inner foot when I walk, just below the inner ankle bone."
Asics,1,The shoe fit was ok.  However I wore them to workout I walked/run 4.5 miles outdoors...I want to cry my feet hurt so bad...when I  returned home I was in so much pain....my feet hurt for several days...So I am sticking with my nike's
Asics,1,The shoe was to way small and gave me a bruise on my right big toe! I could not find anywhere on the website about fitting suggestions.
Asics,1,The shoes are too stiff.
Asics,1,The shoes squeek when you walk.
Asics,1,the sneaker was hard and I returned then 3 days after I purchased them and Im still waiting for a refund. Almost a month
Asics,1,The worst ASICS shoe I’ve ever bought. There’s a hole in the left toe and I’ve had only had them for 3 months. This is outrageous. I see on Amazon that my window for returning them was in February. I am not happy. Amazon should take these back.
Asics,1,"The worst shoes I’ve ever bought, they were defective. I had to send them back."
Asics,1,"These are not wide as advertised but I kept them because I was desperate and they didn’t look bag.  They are the most narrow and (separate issue) uncomfortable shoes I own.  My feet hurt after every use, but I’ve worn them, and I’ve paid for them, so I keep wearing them and it keeps getting worse.  I’ve added inserts and they may feel worse yet.  Very disappointed."
Asics,1,"These are the second pair of this same shoe that I have purchased. I really liked the first pair, so I figured why not get another pair? The second pair is soooo uncomfortable. The tongue on both shoes shifts constantly to the outside of the shoe and cuts into my foot no matter how I lace them. This pair also has zero arch support. I’ve worn them for 2 days and my back already hurts. I wish I had any faith in the consistency of this product, but I won’t be purchasing again."
Asics,1,"These ASICS cut my ankles. I’ve worn ASICS for years, but these were not even close to my previous pairs."
Asics,1,These felt like a knock off. Have worn the Venture Asics for years and these fit terribly but only realized after I had worn them.
Asics,1,These have been worn maybe 6 times. They look brand new except for the hole in the top. It’s almost as if the stitching there was missing all along.
Asics,1,These shoes are awful! They are tight in the toes and rub everywhere. I have blisters all over my feet from these shoes.
Asics,1,"These shoes are comfortable and offer support, however after 1 month I already had a hole in the toe and can't wear them."
Asics,1,These shoes are fake. No support. Cheap shoe laces no gel padding like they promise. It has been glued on the side. Do not order u will regret it. I have already worn them so hopefully they will still let me return
Asics,1,these shoes are not made for walking and standing long durations esp for work and they def aren’t for ppl with plantar fasciitis at all my feet are killing me and when I added my insole it was more uncomfy
Asics,1,"These shoes are too wide in the toe area. They feel ‘shallow’ like your foot is not fully supported. They seem ‘cheap’ in comparison to the Venture 5. I tried everything to make them work for exercise but they hurt my feet, ankles and knees. I could not wait to get them off of my feet. They have been demoted to yard shoes."
Asics,1,"These shoes came in the mail, I was excited to try them after having such a wonderful experience with my Asics Gel-Venture 5 shoes.  The Gel 5 were sturdy, I wore them casually for the last 5 years, walking in the park and on weekends.  But as I started walking more miles, understandably they were getting worn out.  They still felt great but were starting to look pretty rough.  Enter the Gel 7 purchase.  I got these shoes and they felt like they were from a corner cheap store that should have cost $15.  They were so weak with no structure at all (and not in a nice way like a sock tennis shoe like my Merrells).  Sadly I did not return these before the date allowed.  So I decided I must just need to get used to them.  I've worn them a few times for an hour or two but they just are so uncomfortable, like a bad mattress at a cheap hotel!  I finally wore them this weekend on a casual easy hike, I never should have done that.  These shoes are trash, they are so weak, I'd be better off buying shoes for $15 at the local dollar box store.  I seriously think they are fake or the manufacturer changed and the product is not even comparable to cheap shoes at WM type stores. .  I'm pretty sad- do I give up on Asics Gel Ventures or do I move on to greener pasture?"
Asics,1,"These shoes had clearly been worn several times, as some of the treads were worn off. They had been wiped, but there was still a small amount of dirt stuck in the treads. I was not allowed to do an exchange, so I had to return and re-buy- for $8 more. No wonder they were such a ""good deal."""
Asics,1,These shoes had no support. They ran small. I had to pay $17.00 to mail them back. Never purchase these
Asics,1,These shoes literally fell apart in less than 2 months!
Asics,1,These were the most uncomfortable shoes. One felt bigger then the other and hurt my feet after just a few days. I ended up throwing them right in the garbage since they were worn before amazon told me they would try and get me a refund. ASICS wouldn’t help me since I no longer had the shoes. I’ll stick to my brooks!
Asics,1,They are coming apart after a few short months of wearing.
Asics,1,They are really pretty but not comfortable! Not fot high arch and they are very narrow. I wiil give them to mu sister since she has more narrower feet. Lets see how she likes them.
Asics,1,They came broken and used.
Asics,1,"They did not have a larger size to order, but 12 wide should have been plenty large enough, but it looked and fit, or rather did NOT fit, more like an 8 Regular."
Asics,1,They hurt!
Asics,1,They make my feet burn and hurt when I go power walking.
Asics,1,They run small by two sizes! The laces are so thin the don’t stay tied and cut across the top of your foot like wire. The toe area has a huge lump between your toes and sole.
Asics,1,They were the worst pair of shoes that I have ever purchased.  I have been wearing ASICS for years and I will never buy another pair of these.
Asics,1,This is a great shoe and is usually what I purchase except the insert on this pair was not removable and could not put in my Orthotics.
Asics,1,This is not a shoe for walking
Asics,1,This is the most uncomfortable shoe I have brought never buying this again & it fit too small my toes were crunched up !! Did nt for my heel pain!!
Asics,1,This product was tauted as best for ball of foot pain it does not relieve this pain at all
Asics,1,"This shoe felt like cardboard. Stiff, uncomfortable, thin......."
Asics,1,"This shoe is clunky, heavy, and hot.  It is not a good choice for a running shoe."
Asics,1,This shoe runs very narrow
Asics,1,This tennis shoe runs very narrow.  I ordered a wide and it is anything but.  Then to adD salt to the wound they charge to return an item that was not even close to the size.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!
Asics,1,This was my 5th pair of ASICS and I have never had this problem. The fit is off on my foot size and width. Will never wear these again.
Asics,1,To small
Asics,1,"Too much room at the toes and ball of the foot, poor arch support"
Asics,1,Too small
Asics,1,"Uncomfortable. No arch support.  Ordered from Amazon, but would have to pay shipping to return because order filled by ASICS. not Amazon. I did not realize that when I ordered them. Disappointed in Amazon for not making this clear upfront!"
Asics,1,"Very disappointed in this shoe!! I have used Asics for Years, due to a Planters problem.  The shoe was to small, I am an 8 but I always get a 8.5 . Still at 8.5 was too small. The material was cheap looking. Very Disappointed!!"
Asics,1,"Very disappointed, I bought ASICS gel venture 5, the best shoe ever.  5 was made in China.  This 7 is made in Vietnam, low quality.  I bought because I need sturdy support for my orthotics and this shoe is flimsy, shoe laces are horribly thin and too giving, have to put on old laces because causing my foot to move in foot bed and causing my foot to ache and be sore from shoes that move around and slide.  ASICS is going downhill, too cheap on manufacturing to save money."
Asics,1,Very disappointed. I usually wear a size 8 but this style was too big for an 8. As for running. I wouldnt recommended. Not much support as the other Asics I have purchased. Cute style but thats about it. Needless to say I returned them.
Asics,1,Very slippery and wide. I lift and do Hiit workouts so the sneakers were “too supportive”
Asics,1,"Very stiff, not comfortable to run in felt like surrounded in styrofoam"
Asics,1,Very tight around toes and irritated ankle bone.. my size just an uncomfortable  shoe returned two pair and will never order this brand again
Asics,1,Very uncomfortable. I returned them
Asics,1,Was not true to size.  Ran small.
Asics,1,What??? Bought these in Dec and already a whole in the toe area? Come on!!! And I did not even wear that much???!!
Asics,1,When I 1st bought these shoes they were great.  After about a month they are horrible.  My feet hurt so bad after wearing them I went back to my old shoes and felt so much better.
Asics,1,"When I recieved the shoes, that I thought would be BRAND NEW, The box was just a generic box, with the shoes thrown in, the shoes had dirt and dirt scuffs on them like they had been worn, there were NO insoles. I will most likley NEVER order tennishoes from amazon again. This product recieved a 0 from me."
Asics,1,When I wear the shoes without socks they cut the back of my foot cheaply made.
Asics,1,Worst ascics shoes i've ever had. Such a disappointment.
Asics,1,"Worst shoes I've ever bought. They rip blisters REPEATEDLY into my heels despite sock changes, and blister pads both large and small. I have never had blisters so bad in a new pair of shoes, or that keep tearing open larger than a large blister pad."
New_Balance,1,��
New_Balance,1,"4/4 UPDATE - 2 weeks in.... sole is coming apart... worn only indoors at the gym. I'm going to contact the seller to see if they can replace it, maybe this was just a fluke. Still love these shoes and really hope this is an isolated issue.

Original Review Below:
Love these shoes! I’ve been actively going to a cross-training fitness class 4/5 times a week for about 5 months now and was in dire need of a replacement for my running shoes, but not ready to spend a fortune on cross trainers.

I’ve had these for about a week now, and so far very happy. These provide much more support for this style of workout, and my foot/ankle feel far more stable performing the different excersizes and movements. So far they seem like a great choice and I’m very happy with the price.

I’ll provide an update if anything changes as I use them more."
New_Balance,1,A few years ago I bought an earlier version of this sneaker in size 71/2 and wanted to replace it.  This new version in 7-1/2 is smaller.  It seems that the last was changed
New_Balance,1,A friend was just telling me about New Balance and I was excited as they have wide sizes which I need for my bunions!  I try to walk 6 miles a day and so was looking for a good fit and most of all comfort.
New_Balance,1,A whole size too small. I wear 8.5 had to exchange for 9.5 & those are way too narrow for my feet.
New_Balance,1,"About a month of wearing these shoes M-F two holes appeared, one on each shoe by the big toe. I'm going to have to patch these to keep wearing them.  I also immediately ordered inserts after realizing they didn't have much support or comfort.  Total waste of my money, would not buy again."
New_Balance,1,Absolutely killed the arches of my feet after 3 hours of wear around the house. Couldn’t stand them anymore and had to change. My arches still hurt four days later without the shoes. Returning ASAP
New_Balance,1,After wearing them a few months the bottom of the shoe started to come off. I started tripping over a lot and couldn't figure out why until I looked under my shoe and noticed some of the plastic parts of the bottom started coming off.
New_Balance,1,Arrived with part of the inner shoe doubled over and sticking out toward the middle of the shoe. Very narrow for a supposedly wide shoe. First New Balance shoe I have had in years and very disappointed at the quality. Previous shoes were great. Doubt if I will buy New Balance again sight unseen.
New_Balance,1,"At first, I thought these shoes were comfortable. I walk a lot with my job, and I wanted a lightweight, business casual shoe. 2 weeks later,  after wearing them everyday for 9 hrs, my knees and feet were hurting so bad and I returned the shoes. A week and a half later,  my knees still hurt. Bought some supportive, real sneakers and 1week in, my knees are back to normal. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone."
New_Balance,1,"Based on the reviews, I sized up AND went with a wide width shoe.  First of all, it fits pretty decently. I am real irritated about that, because I don't wear a 9W...I'm an 8/5M.  Second, what is with the insole? How do you people find this comfortable? If you scroll through enough reviews on here, you'll find some pictures of the inside of the shoe.  Sure, it's lightweight, but it's still a thick material; not breathable.  But the kicker is this insole that is a little too wide for the already super narrow footbed.  The sides of it are completely exposed at the arch, and it was painful even to put on at home.  These are cute, but jesus christ who is wearing them?"
New_Balance,1,"Bought a 9.5 W as opposed to 9.5 M, since that is how men and women's sizes were being distinguished in the drop down menu. Ended up at 9.5 Wides. I have narrow feet. I can't use these shoes."
New_Balance,1,"Bought these shoes for walking on an upcoming theme park vacation, ans decided to try them out before leaving on a workout. Had to cut my workout short as these shoes had no support, poor soles, and caused leg and foot pain (I'm in my 30s with no history of these issues)."
New_Balance,1,"Bought these shoes in March and have only wore them a handful of times and they already have holes in the edges. Good shoe, I’m wondering if I got a faulty pair because they have such good reviews."
New_Balance,1,Can’t find socks that won’t slide down. Frustrating
New_Balance,1,"Cannot recommend these shoes due to the major lack of support.  Nice color, cheap product."
New_Balance,1,Cat hair all on the inside of both shoes.. disgusting!! I didn’t even try them on because it was obvious that they had been worn and returned but not cleaned!! Return practices need to be improved.. Disgusting!!!
New_Balance,1,Cheaply made. The worst New Balance shoe. I thought I bought a great she but could get it for $10 at any walmart. Someone using the name maybe? Don't waste your money.
New_Balance,1,Color is not what the description states. Very disappointing
New_Balance,1,Comfortable show however it is very narrow.  Foot sits on the inside of the shoe even with insoles.  The inside of the shoe ripped the first day I wore them.
New_Balance,1,"Comfortable when first put on but the width is not wide as I would have liked, by the end of the day I couldn't wait to get them off my feet.  Be cautioned when ordering, wide width is not really wide."
New_Balance,1,"Comfy, walk about shoe. Zero arch support, no foot support for athletics. Sent back."
New_Balance,1,"compre unas zapatillas 5.5w que corresponde a una talla 36 en Colombia; son tan pequeños solo le quedaron a una sobrina talla 34, el cual según la tabla de tallas debería ser  4w. eran un regalo para mi madre y tuve regalarlos a otra persona y incurrir en otro gasto para mi madre."
New_Balance,1,"Couldn’t even try these one. I received a used pair that was filled with cat hair. (I actually had a daughter allergic to cats as well. Was not impressed at all)
Very disappointed with CS when I tried to exchange these for a brand new pair of sneakers I had original paid for.

Ended up returning and getting my money back. Was a disappointing transaction."
New_Balance,1,Cute but way way to small
New_Balance,1,"Decided to buy these because I love New Balance shoes, however I was very disappointed in the way these fit. I had to go up a half size and the fit is still extremely weird and uncomfortable. Would not recommend these shoes, they are nothing like the other pairs I already have."
New_Balance,1,"Definitely not a shoe id want to wear every day, which is what I have to do at work for 12 hours (I have to have straight black shoes, so slim picking). Very uncomfortable. I usually go with adidas & took my shot with this brand. Lesson learned!"
New_Balance,1,Did not fit good and had no support!!
New_Balance,1,Did Not fit true to size! I even ordered a half size larger and they were still too small. Very inconvenient to return.  Buyers beware! Sorry but I had to be honest!
New_Balance,1,Did not fit; too short. Hard to get on with back buckling over.
New_Balance,1,"Did not offer the support I needed, felt like feet were not stable or secure in them when doing activities, cause me severe back pain whenever I wore them."
New_Balance,1,"Didn't have the typical ""tongue"" to shoe, all one piece.  No way to tighten the shoe for a snugger fit.  No support for sole of foot and arches.  Sent back.  Extremely disappointed with this brand.  Will no longer buy shoes without trying on first.  Just a waste of time and also money (the shipping back).  Didn't want to give any stars, but this is not an option."
New_Balance,1,Disappointed with quality of these shoes - I could literally feel the floor through the sole as I walked. Not great support.  Not a running shoe. I wouldn’t use them even just for walking either. They are pleasing to the eye with the cute animal print on the back.  Pay extra for better quality.
New_Balance,1,Do not buy these shoes ! No support at at all . It felt like I was walking on the floor in my bare feet !!!
New_Balance,1,Do not buy these shoes if you plan on being on your feet for a long period of time. Awful shoes for support
New_Balance,1,"Does not like the material, fit terrible"
New_Balance,1,"Don’t like the material, unhappy just not what i expected, I fit size 7-7.5 & these were hurting my toes,"
New_Balance,1,"Dude. I got them a month and a half ago, and the bottom sole is already peeling. Wtf?! And the grip sucks. I’m always slipping! Wtf again?! 🤯"
New_Balance,1,expensive and not well made.  sure not what I am used to from New Balance
New_Balance,1,Fit well and great for walking however the fabric is now starting to rip toward the toes of both shoes.
New_Balance,1,"Flimsy , no support"
New_Balance,1,Got a half size bigger because of reviews- and the shoes were still too small! But also the bottom of the shoe is very small and the show is loose. I tightened the laces but the fabric of the shoe does not offer much support. The bottom of the shoe was not big enough for my foot so my feet kinda were sliding around. I tried with just socks and it was horrible. Then I tried using my copper ankle braces and I was still losing around on the bottoms. Hate these. So uncomfortable. Will not wear again and will not buy this brand online again.
New_Balance,1,Got this to work out in. First The black looked like a deep dark blue second everytime i worked out in these they hurt my feet they are comfortable when you first but them on but not working out. Its a NO for me!
New_Balance,1,"Got was good,  but wearing these for a long period like work not advised, I returned them."
New_Balance,1,"Great fit and support but not durable. The mesh tore after only a few months of very light wear. Very disappointed, I love this brand but the shoes did not hold up to my expectations"
New_Balance,1,Had a month and all the stitching is already coming apart. Used for jogging and lite workouts.
New_Balance,1,"Had these for just over a month and they’re already ripped at the seam. Literally just walking the dog in them, nothing crazy. Had another of the same pair I bought in person, which I had for over a year with out issue. Not sure if these are a lesser quality, but now I have shoes I can’t return and need a new pair. Will not be buying these or from here again."
New_Balance,1,Had to return these because they were to small and had no arch support at all. Complete waste of time
New_Balance,1,Honestly in so much pain from these shoes even after adding an insert for arch support since this shoe has none. They are very lightweight shoes but not supportive at all. Should not be work for working out. I was using them on the treadmill every day for my 45 min walks and I’d wake up to my heels aching and barely being able to stand
New_Balance,1,Horrible . Pésima calidad
New_Balance,1,I absolutely love these shoes- They are perfect for any Disney lover.
New_Balance,1,I always buy new balance. I am always the same size. I opened the box and the shoe is even too tiny for the box. I put it next to my other new balance that are the same size snd it is smaller
New_Balance,1,I always fit in normal or wide size shoes. I bought the wide size and they are too tight! So sad because they are cute. Soo uncomfortable! Top is uncomfortable-all around is too tight.
New_Balance,1,I always order a size 10M and never ever had a problem since my teens. 40+ years. These shoes are labeled wrong because they are way too small and now I have to drive 20 miles one way to return them!
New_Balance,1,I always wear a size 8.  These shoes were like putting on a size 6.  Sizing is WAY off.
New_Balance,1,I am a size 10 in New Balance and these were not true to size at all. And then they are having me pay out of pocket for return shipping which is $27 from UPS!!
New_Balance,1,I am not satisfied with these shoes. I have a pair I bought at store and the beat wearing shoe EVER. This pair same size. Left shoe doesn’t fit properly. Was thinking these were seconds and sold through Amazon. I have worn them twice during my walks and NOT satisfied.
New_Balance,1,I am pretty pissed I have only had these out the box for a week and I noticed when I took it out the box that it was a little frailed so I just left it alone and i go back to look at it this is what I see!
New_Balance,1,"I bought a grey pair, same size and they fit perfectly, so comfortable. This pair was off, they hurt my toes when I wear them more then an hour. I don't recommend them, there is something off."
New_Balance,1,"I bought a pair of these in 9 medium at Meijer. Figured maybe the fit was just small because I usually wear a wide. I liked them the first few times I ran in them, but they were too narrow. Ordered a pair of 8.5 wide off here, and they are EXACTLY the same width as the medium! And too tight. There is absolutely no support, and I can feel my ankles rotating inwards every time I take a step. These are just glorified slip-ons with fools laces. Too mushy, and the sizes aren't true."

New_Balance,1,"I bought a pair of these shoes a couple years ago and have loved them.  They were lightweight, comfortable and the fabric was soft.  This new version of the New Balance shoe is nothing like that.  This pair had little support, and the materials felt cheap and not cushiony at all.  I returned them."
New_Balance,1,"I bought these as walking shoes and found they may be okay to walk around a grocery store, but not for walking for exercise.  No real support or cushion at all.  My feet hurt and I actually got shin splints on my first attempt at using them for only a three mile walk!  The only reason I'm keeping them is they are sort of cute and I'll use them for casual shoes, but was super disappointed overall."
New_Balance,1,I bought these for work on my feet for long periods.  They did not have the support i was hoping for
New_Balance,1,"I bought these shoes and I'm a heavier person.  I wore them for about 20 minutes before I returned them. It's like half the heel was hollow when I walked with each step my both ankles turned inward like
half the support was missing.  Did not like them at all.  Never have I ever had a pair of shoes do that."
New_Balance,1,"I bought these shoes for the support for my planters fasciitis, but after putting them on, they are loose in the toe and arch area so I had to really tighten the laces and since it’s all mesh material, it doesn’t provide my foot the support it needs. Not happy with purchase & it’s too late to return them."
New_Balance,1,I bought these shoes in October to use in a laboratory at my job. Within 6 months they have started falling apart. We're super cute when I got them but I'm really disappointed in how poorly these held up.
New_Balance,1,I bought these shoes to wear to work where I’m on my feet a good bit. They are horrible! They provide ZERO support and feel like such a knock-off brand. I would never recommend these shoes to anyone. Don’t waste your time or money on these.
New_Balance,1,"I bought this based on a list of best cross trainers for flat feet and I wish I'd saved the review so I could identify the author as a liar. Feels almost completely flat across the arch, no support whatsoever. Will be returning it."
New_Balance,1,"I bought this for work, the fit is comfortable but no space for the toes. After wearing it for even a few hours, my toes were feeling cramped. I normally wear a size 8, but a half size larger would be more comfortable for my toes."
New_Balance,1,i chose this shoe for my mom for christmas. She takes daily walks and wanted better supporting shoes. When it finally arrived I never noticed that they sent the wrong shoes because they look similar. I paid for new balance and got skechers (womp womp womp). I went to visit my mom last week and noticed they were not the ones i ordered but it was already too late to return. Good grief!!!
New_Balance,1,"I deeply regret buying these.  They're so hard and thin, immediately suffocating my blisters and corns, which feel decent in a pair of other tennis shoes.  These are unlike any NB shoes I've ever worn and they ARE NOT WIDE.  I would give 0 stars if I could."
New_Balance,1,"I did not get the support I needed. Worse sneakers ever. Am a nurse, this sneakers did not carry me even 6hrs into my 12hrs shift. I had to take it off and find an alternative. Worse sneaker I have ever own. Wish I could send it back."
New_Balance,1,I did not like these sneakers at all. I walked in them for 20 minutes and my feet were hurting. No arch support. Hard to put on and not attractive.
New_Balance,1,I didn’t use it at all because it was poorly designed and had no support
New_Balance,1,"I didn't realize how little support these shoes have when I purchased them. I spent a total of two weeks in them- strength training/running/various cardio machines- before injuring my foot to the point where I couldn't take a step without hobbling and whimpering. I ended up at my sports medicine MD, who said that i had impingement of the structures of my feet due to working out in shoes with no support, and recommended me getting insoles (which were a total game changer- thank you SuperFeet!!)."
New_Balance,1,"I first ordered my regular size 61/2. It was way too small. I returned them and ordered a size 7...also way too small. My toes hit the front of the shoes making them quite uncomfortable. I'm so disappointed....I really wanted this adorable shoe, but just don't want to keep exchanging for the next size. Pity :("
New_Balance,1,I got the shoes on Monday.  When i got home from work on Tuesday I tried on the shoes.  They were so small I could not get the shoe on the foot.  It was way to narrow.  I usually do not need to order the Wide shoe.  But with this shoe it would have been the extra wide needed to even get the shoe on my foot.  I am sending them back.  I will be ordering a different style.  This was the first of two shoes that I ordered and neither fit.
New_Balance,1,I got these because reviews said they were top-rated for interval training. I found that there is not much cushion and no support for lateral movement. My feet are getting injured in these!
New_Balance,1,"I got these in this evening and there’s what it looks to be dog hair all inside each shoe. Also, the bottoms of the shoe are dirty like they’ve been worn. Super disappointed!!"
New_Balance,1,"I had these shoes for two months and the foot liner inside the shoe has already started to tear. I have only worn the shoes about 3 or 4 times.

There is no way for a refund, so I'm not really sure what to do at this point with the shoe."
New_Balance,1,I had to return them because they were not comfortable. They felt cheaply made.
New_Balance,1,"I have a skinny foot, but this shoe made me feel like I needed xx-wide. The insert is SO tiny! I returned and bought another NB shoe with ""normal"" sized inserts."
New_Balance,1,I have a wide foot
New_Balance,1,"I have a wide foot with a high arch - I was excited to find shoes that would work for both. However, the opening to the shoe was narrow and I couldn't even fit my wide foot into the shoe...sigh

if a shoe is made for a wider foot then it should accommodate that throughout the entire shoe not just in the front. Very poor design choice."
New_Balance,1,"I have always been a fan of New balance, but these are definitely the worst ones I have ever owned. I thought they just needed to be broken in, but no, they are terribly uncomfortable. Toes are squished and all around bad fit."
New_Balance,1,"I have always heard good things about New Balance - I guess I should know by now I shouldn't believe everything I read!!  I have small feet with high arches, I thought these shoes would work.  I walk for 8 miles every day and I need a show that is going to hold up.  I put these shoes on and was hopeful.  However, once I stepped out onto the road, I could feel every little differentiation in the pavement on my feet.  I made it a 1/4 mile before I turned around to go back home and change shoes.  Will never buy again.  Do not recommend to anyone who actually doesn't want their feet to hurt!"
New_Balance,1,I have another pair like this in the same size and they fit perfect. This pair is too tight.
New_Balance,1,"I have been a loyal NB customer for years. I was happy to see the style of this shoe because it didn’t have the clunky appearance of a typical athletic shoe. Unfortunately, it offers very little support.  So disappointed!"
New_Balance,1,"I have big feet. Size 11. I have never had issues with 11s being too small, but here we are. They don’t have 11.5, so I will try a 12 because they seem like they are comfortable.

UPDATE: tried the 12, was walking 15-30 minutes 5x a week on a treadmill with them and stress fractured multiple bones in my feet. These shoes offer no support. Do not recommend."
New_Balance,1,I have bought other shoes for this price and they were ok but these are so very cheap with no support at all
New_Balance,1,I have gotten two months out of these. A piece of the tread on the bottom has peeled off(where my husband had to super glue it back together ) I use these for gym strictly and it’s quite disappointing. I’ve bought 2 pairs in 2019 alone. The fact that these couldn’t be get 2 months out of them is annoying.
New_Balance,1,"I have never had an issue with New Balance since they come in WIDE.  I ordered this under the WIDE size and when they came, I knew from looking at them that they were not wide at all.  I had to return them.  The opening isn't like a normal sneaker and I couldn't get my wide foot in the foot hole."
New_Balance,1,I have never purchased New Balance I have heard they are very comfortable so I went ahead and ordered them. When I took them out of the box right away I noticed how cheaply made they were.  I do not wear wide shoes I would not consider myself to have wide feet however these shoes are very narrow so order a wide if you don't normally wear one. I put them on they felt like I strapped  wood planks to my foot the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever put on. I am a nurse and I am on my feet all day so these shoes went right back in the box and shipped back to amazon.
New_Balance,1,I have only had the shoes since the beginning of October and they are already coming apart.
New_Balance,1,"I have these twice and I  will never wear again, they feel like the foot is slanted  towards the arch, they have no support whatsoever and would not recommend for walking or anything that involves wearing shoes! I  have never purchased a worse pair of shoes in my life."
New_Balance,1,"I have this exact shoe in grey. I bought the same size and these fit WAY too small, width and length wise. Very disappointed."
New_Balance,1,I have worn the same size in New Balance shoes for years— these were at least a full size too small. I held them up to a proper pair of NB and they were at least an inch shorter. My big toe stuck out like a sore thumb! Had to return!
New_Balance,1,I have worn these TWICE. The left insole is already peeling and disintegrating everywhere. Is this just one defective shoe or poor quality?
New_Balance,1,I honestly couldn't wear them. I am a 7 1/2 so I thought 7-8 would be fine. It's way closer to fitting like a 7. I'm going to give them to my mom who's a 6 -6 1/2. I think they will fit her much better. One plus is there's a loop hole on the back so it'll be easy for her to pull them on instead of messing with a shoelace (she's going blind).
New_Balance,1,"I initially loved these shoes, but after wearing just a handful of times they have stretched out so wide they are not wearable. I’m disappointment and wish I hadn’t gotten a wide.They do not hold shape."
New_Balance,1,"I like the look of these shoes, but the shoes are defective! I have a pair previously that I loved! Feels like you are walking on a ball on the ball of your foot and it is super uncomfortable! Very disappointed with this product and I missed the window to return!"
New_Balance,1,I like the style but my foot kept slipping to the right even with socks this is the first time this has happened with New Balance shoes. I wear them inside the house.
New_Balance,1,"I liked the style and color, bought these for work but sadly they didn’t fit. Would size up"
New_Balance,1,"I love New Balance and I've worn them for years with no problems.  I ordered these sneakers and wore them about a half a dozen times just to run errands.  I hardly put any miles on them and certainly didn't use them for heavy exercise or running.  4 1/2 weeks in I noticed one of the sneakers developed a hold on the side seam and started to fall apart!  In addition to that, a tiny hole was beginning to develop on the bottom of the shoe, too.  I don't know why this happened and I'm going to give New Balance another chance, but I wouldn't recommend this shoe at all.  My past ones have lasted me years, these only a month.  It's sad, too, because they are super stylish and very comfortable."
New_Balance,1,I love new balance shoes however this product is not worth the box it's in
New_Balance,1,"I love the style of this shoe, but the quality is awful! After a couple months of wear, the entire shoe started separating from the sole."
New_Balance,1,"I LOVE these shoes, they are super light, and comfortable. It basically feels like you're wearing a sock. They're breathable, comfortable, and super fresh style. The white part comes nice and clean with a quick rub of a magic eraser. I would order them again and again!"
New_Balance,1,"I LOVE this shoe, but the second day I went to wear them, the back loop ripped. I was not excessively pulling on them, but it broke. I would recommend them, but do not try to put your shoe on with the loop on the back, because it will break."
New_Balance,1,I loved the look and feel of the shoe but even ordering a half size larger it still fits short.
New_Balance,1,I loved the look and they were super comfortable but they ripped the first weekend I wore them right at the seams! I couldn't believe it! Not impressed especially for the money I paid.
New_Balance,1,I loved the shoe but it was to small. I wear a size 9 got that it was to small. Sent it back got a 9 1/2 and that was to small.
New_Balance,1,I loved these shoes...so much I requested a second pair when the first pair ripped after wearing them four times.  Low and behold the replacement pair also ripped in the same spot upon wearing them 3 times.  They are an absolute waste of money.
New_Balance,1,"I normally wear a 7.5 but followed the recommendation for sizing up. The 8 was the right move as far as the size goes, but nothing else is good about these shoes. There is absolutely no support in them. I purchased shoe inserts for arch support in hopes that offers some sort of support to help me get good wear out of the shoe."
New_Balance,1,I normally wear a size 8 but it was too small so I got a 8.5 and now it's too big. No real support or cushion.
New_Balance,1,I only wear New Balance and ordered the 9W and for the first time it was tight.  Not sure if it was just this style.  I returned them.
New_Balance,1,"I ordered a half size up and wide, and these were still tight and extremely narrow through my arches. I've been wearing them for a week and a half now (in nursing, in my feet a lot)  and my feet have never hurt more, my heels are SCREAMING. Huge waste of money, should have just bought another pair of birks."
New_Balance,1,I ordered a wide it’s not shoe to tight not soft
New_Balance,1,I ordered my size  9.5 and it was so tight.
New_Balance,1,I ordered the “wide” shoe and it is actually thinner than regular sized shoes. Absolutely not wide at all. And it said wide on the box and on the tag on the shoe
New_Balance,1,"I ordered the all black with black sole. These shoes have no support. It feels like you have socks on. I wore them for a week, I go to body pump and do 30 min cardio and my feet are in so much pain. I don’t recommend these at all. I wish I can get my money back."
New_Balance,1,"I ordered these shoes to fill my need of cross training shoes that are supportive for my knees. Within one month, the insoles of the shoes fell apart completely. Not happy at all with the quality"
New_Balance,1,"I ordered these shoes twice! First time I bought my normal size and I tried it on and it felt very thin and too tight I figured well they are on sale so I will order a size up and it will be better...nope. Went up a size and didn’t notice a difference. I didn’t buy these with the intention of wearing them out, just for the purpose of working out at home and even still I would not recommend these. I’m disappointed that I missed the window to return these. Not sure how anyone thinks these shoes are anywhere close to 5 stars."
New_Balance,1,"I ordered these shoes twice!
First 8 1/2 wide which is what I normally wear
Too small
I then ordered 9 wide, still too small"
New_Balance,1,I ordered wide and would have to say I had regular shoes fit wider than these sneakers. Plus the sole/arch is cut weirdly and it curves. My foot looked and felt like a cashew.
New_Balance,1,"I paid $64.68 for this sneakers, but I received it with a Marshall tag $39.99, I was very disappointed with the price. I feel I was overcharged"
New_Balance,1,I purchased these to wear to work in the hospital. I loved them so much I ordered another pair for daily casual wear. However working in healthcare requires you to wash your shoes and when I did the insoles were ruined and all over the washing machine. These insoles do not easily slide in and out for washing. They are sticky back and stuck to bottom of shoe so I assume they should remain in place to wash. Customer services was disappointing. They recommended I purchase some New Balance insoles from them....that cost more than these shoes did!
New_Balance,1,I purchased this shoe and liked the look so much that I ordered a grey pair 3 weeks later.  Sometime early July I noticed a popping sound coming from the sole.  It happens off and on but is quite loud.  I'd  already had them too long for a return so I just deal with it.  Then about 2 weeks ago my grey pair started doing the same thing but on the right shoe instead of the left.  There must be a defect in the sole.  I paid over $100 for these shoes and am very disappointed. C Melton
New_Balance,1,"I purchased this shoe in an 8.5 and ended up sending them back. Although they were the same size, the left foot felt smaller than the right. The right foot fit perfectly; I thought it was my foot that was off but when I measured the actual shoe, the left was in fact smaller than the right foot significantly."
New_Balance,1,I purchased two pair of these sneakers. The shoe is not comfortable for running or walking up hills. I will be returning it because I cannot use these for my active lifestyle.
New_Balance,1,"I really like the shoes until I found that the seams are tearing. One side is worse than other but both shoes have the seam separating at the same spot.

I’ve had the shoes for less than 60 days."
New_Balance,1,I really wanted these shoes so bad. I waited so long to buy them and to only be disappointed. Only a week of wearing them and they are already broken. The sole is already coming off. I would not recommend these to anyone.
New_Balance,1,"I really wanted to like these. I bought two pairs of size 10, one in gray and one black, thinking they would fit like Adidas or Nike. My size 10 Adidas are even a little bigger than other shoes so I thought these would fit perfect.

However, my big toes go all the way to the end of toe box and there is no support in the shoe. If I sized up to a 10.5, then the ankles would be too loose. So they would have been great for errands if they fit— but I can’t imagine working out in them. Unfortunately I returned both pairs."
New_Balance,1,"I received my shoes March 1, as of April 8th my shoe broke. Very frustrating."
New_Balance,1,"I received my shoes today and when I took them out of the box they are filled with what looks like cat hair. They’ve clearly been worn and are listed new. Insides are dirty and both shoes have hair in them. Very disappointed, will not buy from seller ever again."
New_Balance,1,I received these in used condition! I gave them away because I was so grossed out. Pictures included in review. Absolutely disgusting.
New_Balance,1,I returned the shoes. They were quite small and I decided not to reorder.
New_Balance,1,"I returned these because they ran small and were too tight.  They also had little to no heal or arch support.  They are more for style than for working out.  I thought I was getting a deal and saving money.  I wound up going to a NB store and spending $165 on a pair of real running/cross training sneakers with fresh foam, which I love.  They probably aren't worth the money but at least I have adequate support, they fit well, are super comfortable, stylish and I was able to try on several pairs before making a decision."
New_Balance,1,"I returned this because it is not made for people with more narrow feet, but that have longer feet. The bands on the side were way too wide and they stuck out like wings. They did not look right obviously, but I liked the colors."
New_Balance,1,"I returned this item. First of all size too small fit. Felt like no support, and felt like I was walking too flat on the floor."
New_Balance,1,"I sized up as many reviews said. However this shoe is just a huge disappointment. I like NB shoes, but these are just not at their typical level of quality."
New_Balance,1,"I strained my ankle pretty bad after wearing these for 12 hr shifts. They are really cute and stylish, but the support is not there, not in the sole or ankle. They are quite thin all the way around. My ankle got so strained from wearing these that I'm limping. It goes away and then when Im on my feet again or do any exercise the pain is back. I realized this after my return date. I've never had this issue before. When i put on my other more supportive shoes like addidas my ankle feels better. I think it could be the toe area was it bit more narrow tighter than shoes Im used to too. But I ordered my correct size of 9.5 which is .5 higher than my standard 9 shoes which I always order for work out/running shoes. I wish I could get my money back. But I wanted to worn others so they don't injure their ankle or foot as well."
New_Balance,1,"I think it not the true New balance, it could be the flake one from China."
New_Balance,1,"I thought I had 90 return window. It was a gift, due to Covid to me some time to go to person to give. It did not fit!! These are strange times, society is not running in full capacity. Only 30 days return??? Under covid conditions?!?!?! EVERY other retail chain has made COVID-19 exceptions with 90 return policy. Due to all this I want a refund!"
New_Balance,1,I thought these were great for both running and hiit but they didn't last 5 full months before I started noticing holes in the seam under the elastic band. I've never had a pair of sneakers fall apart this quickly. Don't waste your money.
New_Balance,1,"I typically wear a size 6.5 or 7. I had to purchase a size 8 in these shoes! They were extremely comfortable the first month, but then the soles just flattened. I purchased them on April 2nd & they are no longer comfortable. The foam soles are coming apart & are impossible to clean where they have flattened so much. I sit at a desk & do light workouts, but nothing extreme that they should have wore out so quick!"
New_Balance,1,"I usually love NB running shoes. However, with this shoe, I found my entire foot (of which I am a normal width to slightly narrow width) hanging over the sole of this shoe.  No support whatsoever for arch or ankle.  Cross training?? No way. It is more like a running shoe designed for toe to heel movement--and only on a padded track. The shoe is very pretty, but if you are looking for a runabout town shoe, I would not recommend this shoe for even that.  For this reason overpriced and ineffective.  Returned and it's too bad because out of the box...it is very pretty."
New_Balance,1,I usually love New Balance shoes. I got my normal size and they were still tight and very uncomfortable without socks.
New_Balance,1,"I wanted a good walking shoe,I’ve had New Balance before but these are not like any I’ve ever seen.They look like they came from Dollar Tree,save your money.CHEAP LOOKING"
New_Balance,1,I wanted to like these but the ran waaaaaaay too small.  My toes were literally poking out of the front of the shoe.  I don't think even a half size up would have helped.  I returned these immediately.
New_Balance,1,"I was excited for this shoe: a good price for a casual slip on for errands type shoe. Well, I tried to do just that for the first wear, gently pulled on the loop at the heel to slip my foot in and the loop tore instantly. Guess it’s just not well-made."
New_Balance,1,"I was excited to find wide fit, but these were not wide and for more snug than my regular shoes. So disappointed."
New_Balance,1,"I was excited to get these shoes and was very hopeful with all of the positive reviews, but when they arrived I was really disappointed. They are very cute shoes but they're made really small and lack support. I was even going to change out the ensoles to solve the support issue but the backs are also very firm which seems like they would be uncomfortable to wear for extended times. I don't recommend these, but if you do buy them, at least size up."
New_Balance,1,I was hoping that for the price it would be a good deal. To bad they run small. Therefore I had to return them.
New_Balance,1,I was so disappointed in these shoes. The are uncomfortable and so wide around the front of your foot- which you can’t adjust with the laces because the laces are only over your arch.
New_Balance,1,"I was so excited and had high hopes for these just to wear to work on school spirit days. When I first put them on they felt snug, and I bought them in my size so I hoped they would stretch a bit. Well today was probably my 3rd time wearing them and the front part of the shoe is torn and came apart. I am not even doing anything extra curricular in them!! I missed the return window by 2 days....so now I am stuck with a poorly made pair of shoes that I won't be able to wear. I don't recommend these shoes at all."
New_Balance,1,I was surprised to have the low price for New Balance and these are not the New Balance Quality.  If it weren't COVID and buying almost anywhere is close to impossible I would send these back and write to New Balance.  So I am not sending back but for sure writing to New Balance - Chinese Knockoffs.  Had to give it a STAR to go through but nothing would be more what I think
New_Balance,1,I was told these would be light weight and good for me after my Knee surgery.  Not so.  Yes they are light weight but no matter how tight I tie them the have absolutely no support.  I am very very disappointed. They now just live in my closest.  First pair of NB and won't buy another.
New_Balance,1,I was very disappointed in this shoe.  I ordered a size 9.5 wide just like all my other New Balance shoes.  The shoe is very tight and the toe box is narrow.  I walked around the house in them a bit to see if maybe I would like them in a size 10.  I decided against this because there is basically no arch support and my ankles rolled inward. I am going to return the pair. One positive is that the shoe is very cute.
New_Balance,1,"I wear a 9 (true size) in women's sneakers, so of course I ordered a size 9, but it was way too small.  If you wear a 9, you will definitely need a 10, possibly a 10.5.  The advertisement for this sneaker says true size, but that is FALSE.  Order a size up or you will be disappointed."
New_Balance,1,"I wear a size 6M and 6.5M in New Balance. I purchased 6.5M in gray. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was too small. My feet confirmed it.  It was a great, lightweight shoe, but do not know whether to order 7.0M or 7.5M as replacement. I ordered neither and will shop elsewhere - and try on the shoe in a real store!"
New_Balance,1,I wear an 8.5 but these were too small so I had to order a 9. I’ve worn outside already because I work out of town so I cannot return them. New balance must run small.
New_Balance,1,"I wear these shoes for about an hour each day in my home gym.  After a few months, the seams began to rip.  They are now totally unusable and past return window.  Don’t waste your money."
New_Balance,1,"I went to the box store and tried on this EXACT same shoe. Checked Amazon for their price, $25 cheaper. Ordered the shoes, take them out of the box, slip them on and they are WAY TO SMALL! In the box store i also tried the half size up from my usual size to see which would be better. I ordered the bigger size. Very disappointing that i have to return the shoes."
New_Balance,1,I wish that I had got another pair of sneakers. My mom couldn't believe I purchase these sneakers. She said it looks like I'm walking on the floor.
New_Balance,1,I won't by shoes online from Amazon
New_Balance,1,I wore them for 3 12 hour shifts and the padding started to pull up and move around.
New_Balance,1,I wore them one day and the bag loop ripped off the top of the shoe not happy
New_Balance,1,I wore these shoes a total of five times and they ripped. Super comfy shoes but not too happy about the big hole I have now.
New_Balance,1,"I work as an RN in a very busy ICU and usually wear athletic shoes in favor of crocs or clogs. I often work 4-5 days in a row between two jobs and am on my feet a lot, needless to say. My last pair of shoes were new balance and they lasted almost a year and were very supportive. I’ve worn this pair of shoes three times and I am already shopping for a new pair. If you’re looking for shoes with good support that will allow you to be on your feet either standing or walking for hours at a time, these shoes are not for you. If you want something light weight and flexible on days where you’re not going to be too active, I guess they’d be alright. For me, they were a nightmare and my feet are in horrible pain. I’m not sure how other reviewers said they could wear these comfortably with plantar fasciitis because I’m pretty sure they’ve caused me to have plantar fasciitis."
New_Balance,1,I wouldn't recommend these shoes unless you're going to be sitting on the couch and making trips to the bathroom and kitchen.  lol... these shoes are not made for anything other than casual use... it's the perfect shoe for the couch potato!  Even lite walking shouldn't done in these shoes.
New_Balance,1,"I’m always hesitant buying shoes online because I prefer going to the store and trying it out to see how it fits and if it’s comfortable but due to COVID, I decided to take the risk and purchase online without trying it on. As soon as the package came, I opened it up and to my utterly surprise, the shoes looked like it was wore and I bought a slightly used pair. I had previous New Balance shoes and I ordered in a WIDE and it definitely was not wide. It was definitely snug. So please refund because I am disappointed and there should be some quality check because customers like myself are expecting new not used."
New_Balance,1,"I’m an avid wearer of New Balance but these shoes are HORRIBLE! No support at all, laces come untied all the time unless I double knot, like I did as a kid. I  Wear a 7 but I always buy a 7.5 because standing for 12 hours causes my feet to swell. Toe box is very small and my big toe is constantly touching the top of the shoe."
New_Balance,1,"I’m not happy with these shoes. I’m on my feet more than 8 hours and day and I’m constantly walking. I wore these shoes for 3 days, everyday I would come home from work and take off these shoes and try to walk around. I feet felt bruised on the bottoms. Never again!!"
New_Balance,1,"I’m not sure if I got a defective pair or what, but there is a seam that run across the top of the foot and it is painful. I only walked a few steps in my house with them & it was immediately uncomfortable to painful in just a few steps. The cushion in heel and foot bed where nice, but the seam on top was a quick deal breaker."
New_Balance,1,"I’ve been a New Balance fan for decades. I ordered this pair to replace my worn-out, five-year-old sneakers (which I LOVED). I’ve had this pair for only 3 months and they make this incredibly annoying “clacking” sound when I walk. I’ve checked both shoes for stones or other things that could cause the noise, and have found nothing. I’ve included the video to show what I’m talking about (turn up your volume to hear it).

Very disappointed. :("
New_Balance,1,"I’ve only worn the shoes for a few months and they’re falling apart where the fabric of the shoes meets the white sole of the shoe, ripping apart from each other. Appears the shoe is coming unglued. Disappointed as I’ve always been a fan of new balance shoes."
New_Balance,1,"I’ve worn approximately five times for no longer than an hour each time. Honestly, sitting in the car line each time. Not exactly working out. The sole is coming apart already. Not the quality i expect from new balance."
New_Balance,1,"I’ve worn these shoes only 4 times, all indoors and while running on the treadmill and in the gym. They have already ripped on the seems and are continually ripping more."
New_Balance,1,If you have any feet problem do not buy these shoes. I have plantar fasciitis and thought these would be good base on the reviews. Didn’t even last a whole month because I am on my feet a lot.
New_Balance,1,If you’re buying these in a wide just don’t. All the do is add a wide sticker on the box and put a sticker with new label over the old one. If you look at the tag inside the shoe these are normal size not regular. I tried ordering 3 different times and have had the same outcome each time. Very misleading and disappointing.
New_Balance,1,If your interested in a previously worn shoe to only wear around this house this is it.  The shoes were dirty and of poor quality. I never have to order wide shoes but if I ever considered these again I would go wide and up a half size. I’ve tried so many shoes recently and it’s all a bust.
New_Balance,1,I'm a 9.5 and these were so small on me. I would also pay more money for better arch support.
New_Balance,1,"Im size is 7, i ordered a 7 and it fit very small, i ordered a replacement for a 7.5, and it fit the same as a 7. I returned it."
New_Balance,1,"I'm so disappointed! I bought these shoes after trying some on in stores. They fit great, but after only one day of wearing them, the shiny coating on top of the elastic on the side of the shoe started to come off. The coating is now peeling away on them. I can't return them now because they have been worn, but I would never buy these shoes again."
New_Balance,1,"I'm sorry I paid almost $40 for these sneakers.  Think old time canvas keds but with a wider toe box. The upper part of the sneaker is all cloth except for a band of elastic across the instep and there is no support in the footbed at all, just a thin piece of foam from toe to heel."
New_Balance,1,"Inaccurate sizing, description and product!!!! Do not order these from Amazon.  Great shoes I bought my other pair in a store and they're great, these however were a Huge waste of money, So disgusted."
New_Balance,1,Initially I love these shoes. They were immediately comfortable and cushioned exactly what I wanted. But I have now had them for < 5 mo and the insole had chunks peeling out and the rest is so flat that the shoes are not comfortable to wear and il going to throw them out. I'm super sad because they started out so great but died so quickly!
New_Balance,1,Insert padding of sneakers moves all over the place. Can’t get anyone from new balance to help.
New_Balance,1,It didn’t arrived the right shoes
New_Balance,1,It feels as if the heel of the shoe is super narrow. How can you order a wide width show and then the heel be narrow?!?? Horrible shoe. Very disappointed.
New_Balance,1,It is the most uncomfortable shoe I have ever worn. Missed my return window cause I was waiting to be healthy to start walking.  Wore for the first time yesterday.  They are awful!!
New_Balance,1,"It looks great and feels comfortable at first, I worn it with bare foot. Then I used it for a work related trip recently, not even constantly walking but I would have foot pain next morning if I worn it longer than 3-4 hours. I am not so sure what’s the cost of foot pain but the pain disappeared when I switch the shoes. For a reference I am 5.5Ft 120 lb been wearing new balance on daily basis  for the past 15 yeas, definitely figured out which model fits me the best ( for work for hiking for running etc … ) I would not recommend it for anyone use it for any kind of training, it’s lack some kind of support maybe for running errands the most. Very disappointing"
New_Balance,1,It was terrible! They were falling apart
New_Balance,1,"I've been a NB fan for years, but the past few years, they only disappoint, and it's time to move on.  I have a wide width foot, and NB has always had a generous width for wide .. but this sneaker is not wide, it's barely a medium at best.  I've had similar experiences with other types and levels, cheap and expensive, of NB.  If you are a C width, do not buy the wide on this sneaker."
New_Balance,1,La orma es muy pequeña por lo cual me quedan apretados y la calidad de la suela no me resulta muy buena
New_Balance,1,Laces are terrible! They just don’t stay tied.
New_Balance,1,Like the style but no matter how many knots i put in the laces they come untied constantly! Shoe has absolutely no support. Easy to slip on tho...
New_Balance,1,Little padding and arch support. Good for short time wear and look good
New_Balance,1,"Look like cop shoes and toe really bows out-
But, super comfy"
New_Balance,1,Loved them when I first got them but after only a el3 months of use for walking they are ripping at the front of the toe. So disappointed. Definitely wouldn’t purchase again.
New_Balance,1,Made very cheaply compared to others I have purchased
New_Balance,1,"Marked as a  size 7, but not even close.  More like a 6.  Shoe was very poorly made.
Return was easy."
New_Balance,1,"Material is fake, color was supposed to be black, when outside it's blue navy."
New_Balance,1,"Mostly 8 medium shoes fitting my feet, but this shoe is not fitting my feet and feels it is 7.5 instead of 8. The toe wall is brother and uncomfortable my large toes. :( I plan to return it after my trip finishes."
New_Balance,1,"My feet hurt after running in these. They are way too small and narrow in the front that my feet, especially my toes remained in pain long after taking them off.  I feel like these shoes are really size 4.5 or 5 but were wrongly labeled at the factory or something because I buy NB sneakers all the time and have never had this problem before. I'm going to have to give these shoes away because my husband already threw away the shoebox."
New_Balance,1,My foots a 9 1/2 I always get a ten. This shoe is to tight .I can't even wear them. Which sucks cuz I really love the sneakers!
New_Balance,1,"My heal isn’t support, the comfort allows for too much movement and pronation, and there seems to be zero arch support, so disappointed 😞 even changes my posture"
New_Balance,1,My podiatrist recommended NB but these are SO uncomfortable.
New_Balance,1,My shoes are smaller than my suze 10 Nikes. These are 10 1/2. But too small hurt my big toe. Sorry. I like Nre Balance but these are weird. Tku
New_Balance,1,"My wife has had two pairs already of these shoes and they suffer from the same issue. The support on the shoe gets crushed down way to easily and it doesn’t last. Think of it like a soda can when you push down on it, that’s exactly what happens with the support on these shoes. The other issue width wise it runs a little tight and it’s very noticeable. Not the best tennis shoe from a company that I expect more from."
New_Balance,1,"My wife loves them, says they are the most comfortable sneakers she has ever had"
New_Balance,1,"NB has been my go-to shoe for workouts for years.  However, this shoe is terrible.  No arch support what so ever.  Sizing is 'off'; too small by a size.  Despite being small, they slip off my heels while walking.  Already, the bottom of my feet burn when used on the elliptical for more than ten minutes.  Very, Very disappointing."
New_Balance,1,Nice looking shoes that fit well and can get me through a full day at work on concrete floors.
New_Balance,1,No arch support or stability  in shoe. I lived the way they looked but wouldn't be practical at all for every day wear. They also run. very small.
New_Balance,1,"No heel support. Very flimsy, if you want this Shoe for more than casual wear it’s  not worth  the money. I didn’t open the box right away, so I wasn’t able to return them. I am very disappointed. I have purchased New Balance shoes in the past and have been pleased with the Quality their products. Very disappointed in these shoes."
New_Balance,1,No support at all. Definitely would not recommend for people on their feet.
New_Balance,1,No support at all. I wear this shoes for 4hrs my feet hurt already. converse doesn’t have a good support but I can wear it for more than 8hrs and my heel doesn’t hurt. This is kinda disappointing
New_Balance,1,"No support at all. The inside didn’t even have enough material, immediately went into inversion/pronation. Returned these due to lack of any medial aided support. Cheap shoes"
New_Balance,1,No support what so ever. Would not recommend if you are going to be wearing these for more than a few minutes for any type of walking or standing.
New_Balance,1,No support whatsoever. Very disappointed as they were described to have great arch support.
New_Balance,1,No support!!!!
New_Balance,1,"No! Ordered narrow. Width that arrived was B
 a medium. Turns out they don't make a narrow but call B slim. Amazon's description was wrong. I am angry about paying for shipping when it's Amazon's fault."
New_Balance,1,"Normal new balance size is 11W, so I ordered these in 11, they were too small length wise."
New_Balance,1,Not a comfortable sneaker no arch support especially not made for walking or trading in any way.
New_Balance,1,Not for people with high arches and wide feet. Very uncomfortable to walk in.
New_Balance,1,"Not suitable as a ""walking or exercise shoe"" as it provides little to no support.  It is a comfortable shoe for casual wear but will not be wearing this for walking any further than a 1/2 mile.  You might as well buy a pair of sketchers."
New_Balance,1,Not the quality I expected. Sole started coming off after 2 days.
New_Balance,1,Not wide at all. Normal narrow shoe with wide sticker on it
New_Balance,1,Not wide. Feet hurt in them. Not for plus size people.  No arch support. I feel everything under my feet. Not worth the money.
New_Balance,1,Obviously this pair of shoes is labeled the wrong size. It cannot be 7. Seller should confirm. I can't return because I sent it overseas to my sister.
New_Balance,1,"One of the arches was in the wrong spot, wore them twice and it about crippled me. Gave them to a friend and she had the same problem. Complete waste of money."
New_Balance,1,Poor quality. This sneaker does not support the arch. Forget about it if you need support for pronation
New_Balance,1,"Poorly made.  I have a pair like this from a local store and wanted to replace them. These don't even sit flat on a table to, the shoe sole is uneven and badly inverts."
New_Balance,1,Product returned.  Ordered Oyster Pink and received a pair that were very lavender with sparkles.
New_Balance,1,"Purchased the New Balance show back in August, only wore a few times a week to do some walking on pavement.  The shoe has no arch support, and the seam under the elastic ripped within 3 months of owning the shoe. I would not recommend this product."
New_Balance,1,"Purchased these because it's very difficult to find women's shoes/sneakers when you have a size 12. They're soft and comfortable, but that's about it. My feet felt like they were sliding sideways when I walked and they felt like there was no support, which I expected then to have since they are NB. Not happy."
New_Balance,1,Received my package and opened to find a receipt for 59.99 from DSW. I paid 92.00 for the shoes. Felt completely ripped off. Shoes were amazing btw. Store not so much...
New_Balance,1,Returned terrible fit vey hard no support
New_Balance,1,Returned. The insides came apart completely after 44 days of wear. Terribly disappointed.
New_Balance,1,Ripped on the side along the seam within 2 weeks. Don't waste your money.
New_Balance,1,Runs small
New_Balance,1,"Searched ""womens most comfortable walking shoe"" and this came up. Definitely not. The toe box is so so tight (and I have thin/narrow feet) and the back of the shoe digs into my heel making an open sore. Was looking for a comfortable shoe for walking and these do not fit the bill."
New_Balance,1,Shoe insoles after working one weekend.
New_Balance,1,Shoe is too small and there’s no arch support. I do a lot of walking for work and these HURT my feet 😖
New_Balance,1,Show is basically a slip on and the laces are not really functional laces. Size way down or you’ll be walking out of your shoe.
New_Balance,1,Size up!
New_Balance,1,Size was incorrect
New_Balance,1,"Sizes are not accurate. I normally wear 7, but I ordered 7.5 because the reviews say they run small.  These are more like 6-6.5. I had wasted my money."
New_Balance,1,Sizing is definitely off.
New_Balance,1,Smaller than I thought so gave them to my sister
New_Balance,1,So Im not sure whos wide feet are suppose to fit into these but not mine. I think these should say normal width.
New_Balance,1,Sole was not wide enough to fit my foot. Going to try ordering one size up to see if that makes a difference...
New_Balance,1,"Soles are falling apart after occasional wear. I’ve only gas the shoes 2 1/2 mos.
How to return?"
New_Balance,1,Soooo uncomfortable. I see why they were affordable :(
New_Balance,1,Sorry shoes the support is minimal
New_Balance,1,Stretched out after 2 weeks of wearing them to the gym.
New_Balance,1,"Stylish
A bit tight

disappointed because it came out of the box with a STAIN :/"
New_Balance,1,Super cute but absolutely no support at all. Very uncomfortable.
New_Balance,1,Super light weight and simple. Cardio is so much easier when your feet aren’t weighted down by bulky shoes.
New_Balance,1,Terrible
New_Balance,1,Terrible for long shifts on your feet or for taking a brisk walk outside. They look nice but are not durable/ supportive to wear for medical clinics nor exercise.
New_Balance,1,The arch starts at your heel and hurts
New_Balance,1,The back of left shoe was not sewn correctly causing my heel to turn inward. I should have returned them immediately. Otherwise they are comfortable and stylish
New_Balance,1,The back tag ripped the first time I tried on! Very cheaply made. Horrible support and the size runs very small! Would not purchase again.
New_Balance,1,"The black looks navy blue in outside light, especially when wearing black pants/leggings. Looks so off. Comfy shoes, just wish they were actually black."
New_Balance,1,The box says 10 the the actual shoes are 8’s a big waste of my time and money!!!!
New_Balance,1,The color is not the same as the picture. It says black but they are almost blue. But they are comfortable.
New_Balance,1,The color looks more like a faded navy blue rather than black. It runs small and they’re not as comfortable as I expected for NB. I wish I could return them.
New_Balance,1,"The first pair I received had obviously been tried on before. The first time I slipped them on, the heel tag ripped out and shredded. The fit was fairly roomy, so I ordered a replacement item. The new pair was very tight, so I have to return those too. I would recommend ordering a half size up."
New_Balance,1,"The FIRST TIME I put on this shoe, the loop on the back of the shoe ripped!! Dang! I'm bummed.

They are very light and comfortable."
New_Balance,1,The gold and beige/off white combo is not a good color combination. These also ran about half a size short.
New_Balance,1,"The heel is so soft. Makes putting shoes on quickly very tough.  I have had these shoes 6 weeks, and they are already broken down so badly that I have to buy a new pair of shoes.  For $50 pair of shoes, they should last longer than 6 weeks."
New_Balance,1,"The inner soul of the shoe is bent and makes it impossible to wear
I would like to return."
New_Balance,1,"The inside of the shoe feel comfortable but after 3 weeks of wearing them, the inside flattened up and wears out making my big toe feel like there’s a hole."
New_Balance,1,"The inside of the shoe was poorly constructed and rubbed against my toes
After wearing them for only 4 days at work they started to come apart"
New_Balance,1,"The most adorable and flattering sneaker!  I give it one star to attract the attention of the makers: This shoe is a wonderful shoes with DISMAL support and stability.  The ""narrow waist' of the outsole makes this shoe unstable wit ZERO arch support.  The shoe makes your foot look compact and not clunky which is great! It's a Flattering look!  High quality breathable and light weight woven upper -- love!  Great Style!  Awesome color selections!!  LOOOVE The fused/ integrated tongue: nothing to fumble around when putting on the shoe; nothing to bunch up on you.  BUT: the outsole is taken out very far under the arch, making the shoe unstable and unsupportive.  Disappointed overall.  Wish I had not worn the shoe yet and would return it.  Stability and good support are super important for me.  This shoes COMPLETELY fails in that respect."
New_Balance,1,The New Balance Women's FuelCore Nergize V1 Sneaker was too tight across the ball of my foot so was not comfortable at all.
New_Balance,1,The only true about these sneakers is the color.  This is the only reason I give it one star. It has an elastic strap that is way too tight around the midfoot area.  Has NO arch support at all.  Could barely use them to walk for more than 20 minutes.  I would not recommend them at all!
New_Balance,1,The product came to me damaged. I’ve owned other pairs of these shoes and they are great. This one was defective and the sole was detached from the shoe
New_Balance,1,The product was to small and can’t send back cause was missing barcode off shoe when it arrived so I would like my money back cause this was false advertising to small are send me a 8 instead this is ridiculous something cut this small
New_Balance,1,"The rear top heel loop ripped off after 2nd time wearing the shoe. The look of the shoe is nice but the quality of the shoe is poorly made. Also, the shoe fits lower on the ankle then I expected."
New_Balance,1,"The shoe feels very hard on your feet, the liner is thin. My feet hurt in the morning after wearing these shoes after a run. My feet were doing fine until I switched to these."
New_Balance,1,"The shoe is light and easy to move with, but it's too loose and does not provide sufficient support for cross training."
New_Balance,1,"The shoe is small and tight (I wear a 7.5, medium width).  There was NO INVOICE OR RETURN LABEL in the delivery. So, I am having major difficulties in returning the shoes. I filled out a ""How did we do"" survey to the sender, but HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REPLY.  Very disappointed and frustrating."
New_Balance,1,"The shoe is wider than I expected though I ordered it in N and many other NB shoes in N have worked in the past. I began wearing these in February, primarily indoors, the memory foam insert adds nothing toward comfort, the sole is flimsy. I will not repurchase and do not recommend them."
New_Balance,1,"The shoe itself is of good quality and is nice, however it is very narrow, I would recommend a size up. I'm a 8 1/2 in dress shoe, 9 in tennis shoe, I'd go 9 1/2 if possible. I walk on the heel more often than not... Not very comfortable and not much arch support."
New_Balance,1,The shoe only lasted a month before the soles wore out!  Used 4-5 days a week for walking 4 miles in Arizona weather.  Wish I could've returned them or they would have lasted longer.
New_Balance,1,The shoe runs small. I received the shoes packaged as new but one shoe had animal or human (???) hair all in it.
New_Balance,1,The shoe was designed must smaller than usual.
New_Balance,1,"The shoes are beautiful but unfortunately, they run small. I tried to exchange for the same shoes, same color but a half size up and Amazon didn't want to exchange the shoes nor respect the initial price. Bad move."
New_Balance,1,"The shoes are hard to put on. They also don’t stay tied, even on elliptical workouts."
New_Balance,1,The shoes came packaged in the appropriate box but with no other packing material and were very obviously used-I returned them
New_Balance,1,The shoes itself feels awkward like the sole is a lot smaller than the shoe and they are NOT Non-Slip. I was in a rush to have shoes for work and now paying the price big time because they were super slippery and not restaurant server approved
New_Balance,1,"The shoes starting completely coming apart where the sole of the shoe meets the fabric. I have never owned a worse pair of shoes and I would laugh at anyone who said this was 5 star worthy. I came to this brand because I was looking for comfort, but I will never buy another of their products. This maybe a counterfeit - or it could be real. I don't care. Please don't waste your money and just get another shoe."
New_Balance,1,The shoes were supposed to be a size 11 but as soon as I look at the shoes I new they were not.
New_Balance,1,"The shoes were supposed to be a wide, but are pretty narrow and fit more like a 6 instead of a 6.5. They felt decent when I first put them on and I figured they would loosen a bit, which they did. I have a very high arch, and these shoes didn't offer great support, but insoles corrected that. Less than a month wearing the shoes for my morning runs, and the soles are collapsing! If you're looking for durable shoes with good support, I suggest another shoe."
New_Balance,1,The show is very flat. It does not give you the arch support and overall support. The front is too flat. It’s like walking with flip flops.
New_Balance,1,The sizes are very off. I ordered a half size up the first time and they were way too small. So I exchanged for another size up and they were HUGE on me. Would not buy again!
New_Balance,1,"The toe area has a thick glue around the seam area and it hurts my toes when i walk, the shoes them self are great but the hard piece by toes hurt."
New_Balance,1,"The tongue isn't an actual tongue. The top is all one piece of fabric, so when I went to lace the shoe tightly, the fabric just folded on it self, overlapped, and dug into the top of my foot. These are not good for exercise. You can't tighten them well enough to do vigorous activity. But they're cute!"
New_Balance,1,"The whole shoe is weird.

Let's start with the elastic across the opening...Elastic and shoestrings?  Really?  Makes it hard to get the shoe on because it doesn't open up enough to slip your foot in.  Then once you change into thinner socks and successfully plant your foot down, it looks weird.  The shoe fits nicely around the heel, then blossoms into this huge bulbous thing at the end.  Bad enough to have to wear a size 10 women shoe, but to turn them into clown shoes - guess that is what long pants are for.

But my favorite part - how it fits.  Think they forgot to put in support for your heels.  Feels like the balls of your feet are higher than the heel.  I had to buy inserts so I could feel like I was on flat ground.

Got them for standing on cement at day long events.  With the inserts and long pants, should work.  Will have to wait until the country opens up again to let you know."
New_Balance,1,The width is to small..
New_Balance,1,There is barely  enough room in the toe for a comfortable fit. You MUST keep your toenail on your big toe cut down in order not  to put a hole in the top fabric!  Poor support.  You will probably need to put some time of sole insert into the shoe to feel like there is something between your feet and the cement.  I do not recommend this product.
New_Balance,1,"There is no way this shoe is a comparable size 8 to a regular size 8 shoe. I typically wear an 8 room for socks etc.. but I can barely get a thin sock in this shoe and my toes are jammed up against the end. Otherwise they look a nice shoe and like the way they pull on... but this is why I miss the good ole' days of shoe stores and shoe fitters and measurers... because this ordering online and not getting what you pay for SUCKS! Too much returning... and disappointed beyond measure. No, my feet have not grown... as my Asics are a 7.5 and if these are an 8 I will eat my hat! Knock-offs?"
New_Balance,1,There was a sharp point of plastic in the fabric of these shoes that gave me horrible blisters when I tried to wear them... unwearable
New_Balance,1,There was no support and did not fit as expected.
New_Balance,1,"These are a complete waste of money. They are so cheaply made and don't feel like they'll last AT ALL.

WHAT A WASTE OF $$

Returning I'd they'll let me. No support. Crappy fit.

Just a bummer"
New_Balance,1,"These are clearly fake as can be. I own the same pair of shoes in 2 other colors and they fit exactly the same, bought these and they are noticeably out of the box a generic version and probably 2 sizes smaller than what the tag says. Beware!!"
New_Balance,1,"These are NOT non slip! The slightest sight of liquid and you are going FLYING! They run small, like 1/2 to full size small. Do not recommend."
New_Balance,1,These are not real new balance shoes. With very little wear there is no tread left on the shoes.  They had arch support when I first purchased.
New_Balance,1,"These are pretty obviously not real new balance shoes...box was not New Balance either which is just more proof of that. They feel really cheap and don’t fit well, like my feet slide around in them even tho they’re borderline too small length-wise."
New_Balance,1,These are slip-on sneakers. The laces are there partly for decoration and partly to cinch up the slip-on sneaker. Did not realize that when I purchased them. Disappointing. Width ran a bit more narrow than expected. Returning these.
New_Balance,1,"These are terrible for running, my knees have never hurt so bad."
New_Balance,1,These are the most uncomfortable tennis shoes I have ever purchased.
New_Balance,1,"These are the worst ""shoes"". They have zero support and feel like foam slippers. I've worn them 3 times and they're going in the trash. Disappointed in NB, I have a couple other pairs of shoes from them that are far better quality. These must have been designed and made on a Friday just before closing."
New_Balance,1,These are the worst sneakers I’ve ever owned.  The back ankle area is designed so high that within a few minutes of walking they were cutting into my skin. I had bought them for a trip and had to actually take a pair of scissors To them. Do not buy. Whoever designed these should be fired.
New_Balance,1,"These are trash, no support don't waste your money"
New_Balance,1,These feel like they’re going to fall off my feet at any moment (I’m a size 5 and got a size 5). They untie themselves constantly so make sure you tie them as much as humanly possible. By far the worst sneakers I’ve ever gotten. I’m not sure how anyone else has a good experience but it’s been awful for me and it’s too late to return them. I just wanted a pair of work shoes.
New_Balance,1,"These felt super cheap. Foam on the bottom.
And they were pretty snug. Normally an 8 1/2
Leaves some wiggle room for the toes but they felt tight."
New_Balance,1,These have to be one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn.  Almost impossible to wear socks with them - I bought in a D width and they are not a true D width--they are much narrower.  I am very disappointed and expected much more from a New Balance shoe.
New_Balance,1,These just got delivered AND the shoes themselves + box they’re in SMELL LIKE A CIGARETTE. Immediately returning. Disgusting. DO NOT BUY.
New_Balance,1,These shoes are awful.  What's the point in having shoe laces to tie if the shoe is already secured by an elastic strap that cannot be adjusted.  Horrible fit.
New_Balance,1,"These shoes are comfortable but I’ve only had them for 2 months and don’t even wear them working out, just for walking around and the bottom of the shoes are already falling apart!"
New_Balance,1,These shoes are cute and comfy but SO ANNOYING.  The foam insole isn’t attached to the shoe so anytime I take them off the insole pulls up and gets all wrinkled.  Now they don’t lay flat and they’re so uncomfortable.  Wanted to love them but can’t.
New_Balance,1,"These shoes are cute, but that's about the only thing I like about them. The material at the heel is very stretchy, and my foot feels like it wiggles around a lot more than is comfortable. It feels like these will fall off the back of my foot every time I take a step. The bands in the middle of the shoe squeeze around my foot so tightly after a while my feet start to go numb. Disappointing product from New Balance."
New_Balance,1,"These shoes are in no way slip resistant. I fell at work in these shoes and hit by head, sprained my arm, and tore a ligament in my leg."
New_Balance,1,"These shoes are light and easy to slide on and off, but there is not much cushion, my toes feel squished, and my feet just hurt at the end of the day.  I’ve owned nikes, adidas, and sketchers, and non of them have ever made my feet sore.  Don’t recommend these!"
New_Balance,1,These shoes are so cute but they just don’t fit right at all. They are too big where they shouldn’t be and too small in other places. I sized up a whole inch than my regular size and the shoe was still far too short.
New_Balance,1,These shoes are so soft they offer no support..the worse shoes in the United states of America period. When I ordered these shoes I chose the color black the shoes are navy blue..not black.
New_Balance,1,"These shoes are terrible! I’m a nurse and on my feet all day. At the end of my shift my feet, legs and back hurt like I’ve walked barefoot all day"
New_Balance,1,"These shoes are terrible. There’s no arch support. There’s no cushion to them. My feet were sore after the first day wearing them as if they were old, worn in shoes. Definitely not worth the money."
New_Balance,1,These shoes are very lightweight but have no support and I fear would fall apart in less than a month. They are not made well. I returned them.
New_Balance,1,These shoes do not do anything for arch support.  This is after I put my own insert.  I wouldn't recommend this product.  I usually LOVE New Balance shoes...I use this mainly for dance workouts.  I'm very disappointed.
New_Balance,1,"These shoes feel cheap. Fabric around the foot was way to big and could be tightened comfortable with the laces because the fabric wrinkled a lot. Not comfortable even when loose, felt like my feet were falling over the edges of the sole. But they are super light weight."
New_Balance,1,"These shoes feel great but I have had three months and already holes and worn through! Terrible quality. If you need a pair of shoes for a couple of months -these will work. Otherwise, save your money!"
New_Balance,1,"These shoes fit my foot, however there is no way I can walk for any length of time in them.  My heels turn inward no matter how tightly I lace them.  They are unbelievably uncomfortable.  I use them to mow my lawn."
New_Balance,1,These shoes have a nice look however if you're going to get them be sure to size up a full size. I went up a half size after reading reviews and they're still pretty snug.
New_Balance,1,These shoes hurt my feet so bad!! No support of any kind.
New_Balance,1,These shoes offer no support! Literally injured my foot while wearing these... Awful shoes.
New_Balance,1,"These shoes run smaller than your normal shoe size, material is very thin, and offers zero support."
New_Balance,1,"These shoes run so small! I have never in my life worn anything bigger than a 9.5, but even with thin socks, a 9.5 was way too small. Definitely go up a half size at the very least."
New_Balance,1,"These shoes were great on the left shoe. However the right was too short, it created a painful big toe! So I’m returning them"
New_Balance,1,"These shoes were great, until I discovered a huge hole in the left shoe and another one starting on the right! Save your money."
New_Balance,1,These sneakers have zero support.
New_Balance,1,"They are hard, on my right foot is not fitting comfortably in the heel"
New_Balance,1,"They are not all black they are also dark blue. I assume that by “Black/magnet” I was supposed to know this but as “magnet” is not a color, I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect anyone to know that the shoes are black and blue. Very disappointed. I would have returned these the return window is three days. I’m furious with this purchase."
New_Balance,1,"They are super cute and not uncomfortable when you have them on for a short time. But I am so disappointed in these shoes. I dont usually look for shoes with a ton of arch support because I like my feet to be able to flex and move naturally. These shoes not only lack arch support, they force your arch to collapse. I imagine wearing these shoes for long periods of time would cause severe low back pain. Looking at the shape of the shoe it is evident New Balance did not consider ergonomics when creating this shoe. I won't purchase a New Balance shoe again."
New_Balance,1,"They came in Castlerock color. The sole is black. I don't want them.
The one I saw in the pic, is what I was willing to receive. Black with white soles and silver elastic band.
There's a big difierence between them"
New_Balance,1,They didn’t fit to tight
New_Balance,1,They Lack Support And Are Uncomfortable After Wearing For A Half Hour And Are Not A Fair Price For The Quality. Would Not Reccomend
New_Balance,1,"They look good, but I do not like these shoes for any exercise. I walk between 3-10 miles a day (for exercise) and these shoes are not supportive. My feet hurt after a few miles. They are not made for high arches,not do they support pronating. I wear them just around, but I am disappointed they are not more supportive or more comfortable in the sole of the shoe. I feel these are made more for someone who has a prominent heel strike and walk or runs on a smooth surface on an even elevation. I wish I would not have spent money on these. Back into my old shoes, I guess. :("
New_Balance,1,They ran smaller than the shoes  in the store.
New_Balance,1,They too shot
New_Balance,1,They were way way smaller than how the size said!! I’m returning them n would like a credit made to my account! Thank you
New_Balance,1,They're is no arch support the insole is way too thin and flattens out. Wore them for a 12 hour shift and my feet were I'm so much pain. Toe box is roomy and can wiggle toes but after a long shift my feet swell so they  were pretty tight. Overall they're not good for long shifts.
New_Balance,1,Third time I’m going to wear them and they ripped? WTF don’t buy
New_Balance,1,"This is not the first time I’ve purchased shoes from Amazon, but it will absolutely be the last time. I opened the box they were delivered in, unwrapped the tissue, and to my surprise, there’s a Marshall’s tag attached advertising these shoes for $39.99. That’s great and all, except I paid Amazon $64.99 for these. If it weren’t for the tag left on, I’d be dumb enough to keep them for the price I paid, but I can’t in good conscience keep them so they are being returned! The color is also off...these are much more pink in person than what is shown on the website description."
New_Balance,1,This is the most uncomfortable I have and it’s a waste of money 😡I felt more comfortable walking bare foot.
New_Balance,1,"This is the most uncomfortable New Balance shoe I have ever had. I normally buy New Balance because I know my size and the construction, fit. and support have always been great. However, with this shoe, the first time I went for a walk my feet were stinging by the time I got home. They are also a bit difficult to get on, as there is no real lace, but an elastic across the top. I'll go back to the old styles."
New_Balance,1,This is the second pair I bought. While I love the look in the fit they make my feet stink. Never in my life I had shoes that made my feet stink. I bought a second pair hoping maybe it was just the first ones got wet or some thing but they’re doing the same thing after only wearing them for a week.
New_Balance,1,"This is very well made but its not for prolonged walking because very poor arch support and it doesnt give ankle support

These complaints are common.  I wish i didnt buy it but it is well made just very poorly constructed and new balance has always had top quality sneakers"
New_Balance,1,This New Balance shoes is very cheaply made and very uncomfortable. Save yourself from needing to send it back and be a better quality shoe.
New_Balance,1,This product is a waste of money. I think the picture speaks for itself.
New_Balance,1,"This shoe caused me pain and suffering. It made my feet go against their natural stance and caused me a tremendous amount of pain!! I only tried them on and took a few steps. I like the design and wanted to keep them, so I tried them on again. Big mistake!!! My knees are still in pain several weeks later."
New_Balance,1,This shoe did not fit my daughter.  It was way too small.  Put a size 5 next to a size 4 and a half of adidas and it was smaller.  Sending them back
New_Balance,1,This shoe goes inward and has no arch support whatsoever.
New_Balance,1,This shoe has no support.  It has no tongue so you can't use the laces to get it to fit snugly.  My feet slipped around inside the shoe after I'd fastened it up the best I could.
New_Balance,1,"This shoe is terrible. I ordered the wide, which for most shoes I don’t even need but wanted a more comfortable fit for work. The “wide” shoe is so narrow the sole didn’t even cover the bottom of my foot. It’s more narrow than any shoe I have ever worn. And I triple checked to make sure they actually  sent the wide. Both sides of my foot are hanging off the edges. And absolutely no support. Returning these."
New_Balance,1,This shoe literally unraveled during my 2nd visit to the gym! I was so embarrassed and confused because they were practically brand new. All I do is 20 mins of treadmill  and 15 mins of elliptical!
New_Balance,1,This shoe looks and fits completely different than expected
New_Balance,1,This shoe offers absolutely no support. Definitely not a workout shoe. Ok for elliptical maybe. Don’t bother
New_Balance,1,This shoe runs small
New_Balance,1,"This shoe was comfortable initially but very quickly lost support and the heel collapsed, causing my feet to pronate and have pain. Do not recommend"
New_Balance,1,"This shows are very cute but I was surprised at the lack of arch support and the overall uncomfortable feeling of this shoe. This did not feel like new balance at all, they very cute but felt more like  cheap lifestyle sneaker. Retuned."
New_Balance,1,"This sneaker fit horrible. No support on the ankles. Tight on the toes. If you walk for 15 minutes,  the sneaker allowed you to feel as though you were walking on the floor without shoes. I am really disappointed.  I love NB and I don't know if I want to purchase any pair of sneakers from them."
New_Balance,1,"this sneaker is not a good walking sneaker or working out sneaker. I honestly would not recommend for working out.
over all its a nice looking sneaker. the foam insole has very little cushion. I am considering adding extra cushion insole as its not comfortable with the thin one it comes with.
I have been buying new balance sneakers most of my adult life and this one definitely has not been a good purchase."
New_Balance,1,"This style runs very small in comparison to my current NB walking shoes.  It also costs to return which I am not accustomed to with Amazon Prime.  I returned same day I received at UPS store ( 5 days ago) and still have not been reimbursed.
Unhappy"
New_Balance,1,This tennis shoes hurt the bottom of my feet will never buy again
New_Balance,1,"This was my first time trying out New Balance. I LOVED these shoes when they arrived!! For the first two weeks they were my favorite shoes of all time. Comfier than any Nikes or other shoes I had worn, & oh so cute! I loved how light weight they were, too.
However, they only lasted two months. TWO MONTHS! Their sole has already lifted up & is all wonky & junky. The memory foam is VERY short lived, & after a short time it is no longer supportive or cozy in any way. Also, the material is all stained, & despite my best efforts, does not clean well. I will never buy a New Balance shoe again. Severely disappointed! At least my Nikes lasted me a whole year of daily wear."
New_Balance,1,This wasn’t true NB product had to return looked cheap . Received replacement still the same . Took 4 weeks for refund
New_Balance,1,"This will be the third time I have to return these tennis shoes, my daughter wears a 8 and the  8 1/2 still to small now I have to call and exchange them to a 9.  Not happy!!"
New_Balance,1,"Thought for New Balance brand, these shoes would have more support, especially through the arch. I did appreciate the light weight material, but was disappointed in the fact that they wore more like flats than tennis shoes."
New_Balance,1,To much small
New_Balance,1,To much small
New_Balance,1,Toe box small. Wide shoe not wide at all. Really hard to believe that this shoe is a new balance.
New_Balance,1,"too bad these shoes have New Balance name because they are not at all the same quality of new balance which i have worn for years. the shoes have little to no sole and the shoe itself is made of a thin fabric, no tongue. these would not be good for running or walking or wearing anywhere. no support, very very poor quality. DO NOT BUY!"
New_Balance,1,Too narrow
New_Balance,1,Too small
New_Balance,1,Too small toe box tight I return them
New_Balance,1,Too tight. Wore once. Very difficult to place on foot. Does not open wide to allow foot to slip in place to tie without a struggle. Return. No label.
New_Balance,1,Too wide in front of sneaker have to tie tight and creates an ugly buckle of fabric looking at top of sneaker. Weird design. I hate but too late wore to yoga.
New_Balance,1,Took out if box and had a TJ Maxx tag for $44.95. I paid $64 Should have asked for a refund right then but had planned to wear with certain outfit on vacation. What a mistake as the size was also not correct as I have same tennis shoe in gray and these were smaller!
New_Balance,1,Totally disappointed in this shoe.  Zero support and little cushion.  Impact on heels was worse than any other shoe I have.  I don't recommend these.
New_Balance,1,Tried these in several different sizes and none fit right
New_Balance,1,"Una porquería no es lo que pedí y demasiado pequeño el color diferente, que decepción,  tengo una suscripción de amazon prime por un año y ya estoy harto de tantos disparate"
New_Balance,1,Uncomfortable shoes:(
New_Balance,1,Very cheap quality.
New_Balance,1,Very comfortable
New_Balance,1,Very disappointed in the lack of support In the shoe. My roll so badly people stop me to ask if my feet are ok.
New_Balance,1,Very disappointed that shoes was improperly sized. Tag read size 8 but was incorrect. Much much smaller than an 8. I ordered on prime day and was not able to reorder for same price.
New_Balance,1,"Very disappointed the shoe is made from one piece of material.  So the mouth of the shoe does not open wide enough.  Yes there is elastic there but the material only stretches so far.  The result is when putting your foot in it pulls your sock tighter around your toes, constricting them, becoming very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend."
New_Balance,1,Very disappointed with these sneakers. Really thought they would give me the support I needed to walk. Unfortunately didn’t hold up well for a mere 2k walk. Will be returning.
New_Balance,1,Very light weight. Very hugging shoe. Maybe wise to buy wide size.
New_Balance,1,Very small (even ordering a size up!) and narrow. Not the quality I expect of New Balance. Shoes were returned.
New_Balance,1,Very uncomfortable!
New_Balance,1,Walked in them seemed very flimsy.  Not enough support.
New_Balance,1,"Watch out with this company, Bealls of Florida! They don't do exchanges nor do they pay return postage. I just needed a size larger which they won't send and I'm stuck with the return postage!
The shoes seem fine, very light and stylish."
New_Balance,1,"Way too small. I’m not sure if the other reviews were talking about this specific shoe, but there is zero arch support. I have other new balance sneakers that I love and I know to get a size up. These were so small that my toe was pushing out the front and top. So disappointed"
New_Balance,1,Way too small. Very upset at the “true to size” claim. I wear a size 12 in everything else. Except this. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Sucks to have to return these. They feel comfortable on the bottom part at least.
New_Balance,1,"Way way way way too small. İ went from a 10 Wide to a 10 1/2 wide and it was like I never got a different size, wanted to try an 11 wide but they didn't have any, supper bummed cuz they were a really nice looking shoe. Obviously only for casual wear, but did notice the sole was very weak. İ tried then on once and they creased. I'm not that heavy. Only 165 lbs. So didn't expect them to last long if I was able to fit them."
New_Balance,1,Wayyyy too small. Bottom feels like plastic
New_Balance,1,"What a waste of money! They are incredibly wide, i bought them for vacation. It was lots of walking... within 1 day, i took the shuttle to find a new pair of sneakers!"
New_Balance,1,"What I disliked about these New Balance sneakers, are the lack of arch support. They are also a bit tighter than expected. I shipped them back, simply because they are very poor support sneakers for everyday wear... they are not good supportive shoes for your feet period."
New_Balance,1,Width does not fit like a wide shoe
New_Balance,1,wife has these shoes bought at fredmyers size 8 and they fit perfect we ordered off this site and they don't fit to small
New_Balance,1,Within 2 weeks there was already a piece of the sole worn completely off.
New_Balance,1,Won’t be buying these again. I have bad knees and this pair had no support while walking. I think I over probate and within 5 minutes of walking my dog I had knee pain and had to turn back to replace shoes. Actually took me a couple of weeks to undo the 5 minutes of walking. They were just not for me at all.
New_Balance,1,"Wore these to the gym once, and never wore again. Horrible support, extremely narrow. Do not use these to run in. Maybe walk? But they are painful and not what I would consider actual athletic shoes by any means. Purchased due to high rating and extremely disappointed in this product. On a good note, they are very light weight."
New_Balance,1,"Worst shoe ever !! No support , very disappointed 😞"
New_Balance,1,"Would not recommend they where bad quality, not in the corresponding box and had cat hair all over when they where supposedly not used."
New_Balance,1,Zero arch support. Expected more from a New Balance shoe
New_Balance,1,Zero arch support. No ankle support. Difficult to wear socks with because of how low they are cut. I spend 12 hours a day on my feet and these shoes couldn't cut it.
New_Balance,1,Zero support. I don’t know how anyone can workout/run in these. The back of the sneakers always slip off.  I consider it a leisure sneaker.
Nike,1,2nd time I’ve ordered the correct size and get a different size than what I ordered. :(
Nike,1,After a month and a half they already have a hole on the toe.
Nike,1,BEWARE!! These are fake. I have bought these shoes before from the actual Nike store and these are not as comfortable. Also I received 2 different style shoes.
Nike,1,"Bought them on 1/24/2018. Today, I needed to buy a new pair of shoes for my son.
He wore them for school only, no weekends, for 2 months.
One shoe had torn material in 3 places. The second was put together by his teacher with duct tape.
I went to the store, bought a new pair and threw these away.
Do not but them for kids!"
Nike,1,Bought these for my 13 year old son.  He loved them right out of the box and they fit perfectly.  HOWEVER!  The toes on both shoes tore on the very first day he wore them.  Both feet developed tears on the outer toes before the day was over.  VERY poorly made and extremely disappointed.  We won't buy these again.
Nike,1,"Box was trashed and these were worn and returned. Bottoms CLEARLY show dirt and some sticky substance. Extremely disappointed!
They were laced up as well. New shoes do not come completely laced up!!!! Ridiculous I paid a decent price!"
Nike,1,Cheaply built poor fit. Donated to Goodwill.
Nike,1,Comprados hace 5 meses y ya están rotos.  Muy mala calidad. No los recomiendo
Nike,1,Did not have my size and order different pair and then they had my size.
Nike,1,"Dislike very my h, this is not red its orange was not a two day shipping over a week...just horrible"
Nike,1,"Do not buy it, Nike you are a joke!! 2 big holes at the side of the shoes. The quality is terrible. Get anything else, for sure it's gonna be better, anything. I start doubting the review system. This product CANNOT have an average score of 4.4 (almost 800 reviews)!!!! Something is wrong here."
Nike,1,do not buy it. These sneakers tore and broke in less than a month
Nike,1,"DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I've had these shoes for a few months now, and I needed to buy work shoes. So I went into the store and saw the ""same "" pair of Nike Tanjun sneakers...the ones I bought online are fakes. Don't buy them! They are way more expensive, have a fake sole that are supposed to be a squishy memory foam material,  and they fall apart after being used for a few short months. Not happy with this product!"
Nike,1,"Fake, don’t waste your money on such obvious fakes"
Nike,1,"First of all they were way too small. My daughter normally wears a size 8. Ordered an 8 and they smashed her toes. Went to go return them (following the Amazon return process) and it costs me $26 to ship them back from the states. Yes, $26. I had to return something that didn't even fit because they can't get their sizing right. Total joke!!!!"
Nike,1,Fits too tight although my little one wears 1 1/2
Nike,1,Glue marks from manufacturer and sneaker is white so not hsppy
Nike,1,Got these for a family member as an Xmas gift only to have them open the package and the shoes were used I didn’t order a used pair of shoes I’m disappointed and sending them back hopefully gonna re order them again and hope they’re a new pair of shoes
Nike,1,"I bought these brand new but when I received them they were used. As you can see, the bottoms are dirty. I’m very disappointed since I buy a lot from Amazon."
Nike,1,"I bought this shoes in October 2019, and it is already ribbed. Not recommeded."
Nike,1,"I bought two pairs for my boys , both pairs had major holes by the end of the week. The quality is terrible , Nike has lost my business"
Nike,1,I do not recommend these shoes for any price they are available for. I’ve had these shoes for a month and already need a new pair of shoes. They are not very comfortable either
Nike,1,I had to return due to size. These run at least 2 (US) sizes too small.
Nike,1,"I have an old pair and they have red insoles and are very comfortable. These had a white insole and felt zero support. I wear a 6.5 in all my nikes and they all fit perfect, but these fit like a 7."
Nike,1,"I ordered 8 1/5 US and you sennt me 9 1/2.
I can’t wear this size of shoes."
Nike,1,I ordered and x-wide. It was not true to size very narrow. Also I found a receipt in box that this had been previously returned sometime right after xmas. 1.5 months before I had ordered. Very dissatisfied
Nike,1,I ordered one size and I got a pair 2 sizes smaller. Very unhappy
Nike,1,I ordered the black and white tanjuns and received all white ones instead. Tried to get replacements twice and received all white both times for the replacements as well. Now I have three pairs of all white shoes that I don’t need.
Nike,1,i ordered the mocha color and received a white pair with a bright pink nike swoosh. very disappointing. returned.
Nike,1,I ordered this shoes in black and white why am I receiving full white and I ordered black and white. I am beyond upset
Nike,1,"I think these might be fake , the sole feels really cheap. Fits ok , just doesn’t look like a real Nike shoe ."
Nike,1,"I was expecting these to be more of a ""coral"" color, but felt they were more pink than coral."
Nike,1,I was sent the wrong color shoe. Ordered black with white swoosh. Was sent a solid white that had yellow stains
Nike,1,I was sent two right shoes instead of a right and left
Nike,1,I was so happy to find red tennis shoes until I opened the box.....the shoes are hot pink......my most indecisive color!! So dissapointed.
Nike,1,I'm a nurse and on my feet all night.  I got the black and white in a size 8 and wore them for the 1st time tonight.  I was miserable and my feet hurt so bad! There isn't much padding and they just feel cheap.  Most uncomfortable shoes ever. Returning!
Nike,1,"I'm sure they'd be nice...if they fit. Ordered a Size 4 (just checked my invoice to confirm) and they sent a Size 6. Super disappointing as we're leaving for vacation tomorrow, and my little boy needed new shoes for the trip. Sucks."
Nike,1,It says they’re red but it’s a salmon color. They were stains on one of them. Very comfortable though. Will be good support for working out!!
Nike,1,It was the wrong size
Nike,1,Item looks like it was a used return. There is a stain on the fabric of one shoe. Laces are already in and are totally uneven. Makes me think I am getting theses secondhand with firsthand prices. Soles look good though. Not happy.
Nike,1,"Item not as pictured, shoe is all black including the sole. First time this has happened to me and I buy on Amazon a lot."
Nike,1,Item was returned
Nike,1,Just one week at school and already pulling off the nike sign.
Nike,1,just sucks
Nike,1,Liked these shoes until I noticed this last night. Only 7 months old and I'm highly disappointed 😩😩😩
Nike,1,Lo queria para regalo de navidad y nunca li recibi muuuuuyyyyy mallllaaass experiencia malaaaaaaa
Nike,1,Material pulled apart from the rubber sole  near the toe and material had pulls in it after one week!  Very disappointed!
Nike,1,"Me mandaron diferentes tenis,no son iguales ,no revisaron antes de enviarme su producto ."
Nike,1,meh
Nike,1,"Most of my shoes are and have been Nike and I've never had an issue until this pair.  Most of the time I pick up the previous year's style for around $60 to $100.

I picked up this pair to keep at work to go out and get some steps in... fifteen minutes here and there.  The first thing I noticed was that there was no arch support.  No biggie, I'm not running a marathon.  After I couple of walks I notice my left knee has a slight pain.  A few more walks later I realize that the left shoe rolls out from under my foot and my over correction is what is putting extra strain on my knee.

At this point, only wearing the shoes maybe two dozen times or so, while holding the shoe upside down you can see why my foot is rolling inwards

All the time I try to tell my mom she needs to buy better quality shoes, that if you take care of your feet they will take care of you.  I guess karma got me!  I tried to save $20 and probably got the one pair with a defect... or did I?"
Nike,1,My son wore these for 2 1/2 months and there is now a hole on the top that goes all the way through to his sock. I expect more from Nike and a LOT more from $55 kids' shoes.
Nike,1,No arch support
Nike,1,Normal wear and tear by 9 year old boy and you can see how it fell apart and is not wearable; I alerted the company and because it was beyond the 30 day return policy they refused to do anything.  Save your money and buy a quality shoe
Nike,1,Not a good show for wide feet
Nike,1,Not happy. Shoes fell apart.
Nike,1,Nunca recibe mis tenis y eso que ustedes cobran primero es un mal servicio no comprare jamas!!!
Nike,1,Ordered a 7...was smaller than a 6...had to spend $25 to return.  Amazon credited my account as soon as shoes were received...that was good
Nike,1,Ordered a size 2 and was significantly smaller than the regular. Also lols poor quality. Would never buy again.
Nike,1,Ordered black with white sole and received black with black sole. Double check that what is pictured is what your ordering.
Nike,1,"ordered black
received white"
Nike,1,Ordered is 6 which is my normal shoe size these ran way too tight and too small being shipped back tomorrow
Nike,1,Ordered white Nike shoes twice. Received black shoes both times. I do not recommend this website
Nike,1,"Package came smashed, which is more annoying then bad, but the shoes look like they have been worn dirty on both shoes and bottoms"
Nike,1,Package says the show is wide 2E. But the shoe is an 8 no mention of a 2E and the shoe is not wide. Ordered a second pair and had the same issue.
Nike,1,Product didn’t have label stating it was extra wide. It did not fit properly
Nike,1,Right shoe was smaller than the left even though tags inside shoes said they were the same size
Nike,1,seriously? security tags?? are your warehouse people stealing shoes now???
Nike,1,Shoe does not come in wide width
Nike,1,Size 10 is like size 8. Very bad sizing.
Nike,1,"Size not true to actual size. My size is 37.5/38
Size 8 of these  sneakers is actually a 39. Too big
How can I return them without the original box which I trew out before discovering the problem?"
Nike,1,"So disappointed...
I really don't believe these are genuine Nikes. They are cheaply made! They kill my feet, too."
Nike,1,"So this is the 2nd time i have bought these shoes... first it was too big and i had to give em away... and now this one is still a lil too big for me, i will also be giving this one away...  i have given up... feels very comfy tho so if u get the sizing right I think you  will happy with the product"
Nike,1,"Stylish and comfortable, but the material that covers the toes is poor quality. This is the second pair that I have purchased and both pairs wore terrible around the toes and eventually wore through leaving holes. Shoes lastest between two and three months before the holes appeared. I will not purchase again."
Nike,1,the color was not true to what I received
Nike,1,"The fabric in the shoe is not properly glued to the sole, is all wrinkle.  Therefore even when  the sole size is, my kid does not fit in the shoe since there is no space due to the fabric. Terrible!! money wasted"
Nike,1,The glue on edges of both shoes were extremely yellow and very visible. Extremely disappointed as this shoe is very comfortable.
Nike,1,The image on the website does not show the entire shoe. It is half blue on the inside.
Nike,1,The product arrived with a cut across the Nike symbol on one shoe like someone opened the box with a knife and the product was shipped way after the promise date. Completely missed my wife’s birthday.
Nike,1,The right shoe fits perfectly and the Left shoe fits tight
Nike,1,The seams are in strange places as well as the swoosh. There is visible glue where the soles meet the shoes. Feel very flimsy.
Nike,1,The shoes are not true to size.
Nike,1,"The shoes look fine and as if they have never been worn before, but did not arrive in a Nike shoebox. They were just placed inside the shipping box by themselves, so I am not sure they actually came from Nike. I was planning to give them as a gift, so certainly would have preferred to present them in an official Nike shoebox."
Nike,1,There is no way this is real Nike. I’ve been wearing this style for years and I made the mistake of ordering this pair through amazon. While it’s not the worst shoe in the world it feels nothing like the real one that I wore and loved. Do yourself a favor and buy the real shoe somewhere else
Nike,1,There’s no way these are real Nike. Nothing like my last pair. Very Disappointed.
Nike,1,These are FAKE!!!. Bought twice and both times they got a hole within one month of daily wear in the toe of the shoe. See photos. Also inside they wore through and had pieces sticking out.. I loved the rose gold swoosh and had an original/real pair that lasted over 18 months or longer with no issues - which I bought from Academy. Went back to Academy to buy just all black (as rose gold no longer available) and they are the real deal. Be aware these will not last like true Nikes.
Nike,1,"These are horrible. You can see glue all over the sole of the shoe, I put them on and walked around, and one shoe was tighter on my right foot and was hurting my toe. The right shoe was smaller then the left. These are fakes. I’m so disappointed."
Nike,1,"These seem like really cheap shoes.  It's hard to believe they are Nike.  Absolutely no tread, the sole is stiff and there is no cushioning.  Only thing positive I can say is the top is sock like and comfortable.  Wish I could return them but I wore them already."
Nike,1,"These shoes are awful, No cushion at all, for someone that walks 8 miles do not buy these. After about an hour it feels like your walking on cement. It’s their version of a house slipper these tennis shoes are awful."
Nike,1,These shoes are not Nike quality. They started falling apart after wearing them for 2 months. They don't give you much stability. I would not recommend.
Nike,1,these shoes were fakes! They came without tags in a plain brown unbranded box. After receiving them I did so research and realized I had been scammed.  To top it off about 3 days later I became the victim of a Brushing scam with products sold on amazon. My suspicion is that this seller was involved.
Nike,1,These were delivered previously worn and stained.
Nike,1,"They hurt my feet, especially my heals"
Nike,1,They sent me two different I'm assuming style of the same shoe one made in Indonesia the other in Vietnam. Different color combinations and soles .box says made in Indonesia. More than likely it was sent from another seller. Really disappointed bought these for my mom for mother's day now I have to return them ...
Nike,1,This is the cheapest shoes I’ve purchased. Very poor quality. Won’t recommend it to anyone
Nike,1,This product was Despicable Not only was it way too small. Smaller than advertised. Cost me $24 to return a $65 item. Not worth the money never again
Nike,1,Too small
Nike,1,Too small and I had to pay $13 to send them back!!
Nike,1,Too small Didn’t fit
Nike,1,"Unfortunately these shoes cause severe pain in my feet, knees, and back. Very disappointed and wish I hadn't wasted the money."
Nike,1,Usually get the same size in Nike’s but these were way to small list out on money
Nike,1,Very bad
Nike,1,Very poor quality product that shows tears in material after just 3-4 day use.
Nike,1,Very small
Nike,1,"Well, let me say that I started looking for a new pair of sneakers for my giril without shoelace, or at least, she won't have to keep tying it the whole time, so these were her second pair for same school year, she loves her that only have a velcro on it. so pictures to me, seemed not to be necesarily to tie it over and over"
Nike,1,Worst quality shoes we have ever purchased.  My 11 year old daughter has worn them for a couple of months and the shoe is ripping loose from the sole.  CRAP!  TOTAL CRAP!
Nike,1,"Wrong color, too big and quality seems sketchy. Not comfortable and well made like Nikes Ive had before. Very disappointed. Sticker with the color combo I specified was slapped over the original sticker which reflected what was in the box."
UA,1,"100% knock off!!! Glue all over them
Glue on symbol
Freyed edges
Awful"
UA,1,A month later the black color of the sole started to fall and became white. Not nice at all. Would not buy this aver again
UA,1,"After only 4 months!!!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTING, will not be buying under armour shoes again. Shame, Under Armour, for having such cheap crap."
UA,1,"After two days of wearing it, it started to irritate the back of my feet.  I thought it was my socks not long enough covering, but even with long socks it bruised really bad.  See the picture as a proof."
UA,1,"Bought these for a 1 week trip to Florida. As you can see in the pictures, the shoe started to fray and a even bleach out. All I did was walk around in them. No beach, no pool.
Plus I'm a size 10 wide and these were snug. Even bruised up my ankles.
At this point I'm not even sure they're the real brand. Just feels like knock-offs. Super disappointed"
UA,1,"Compré tenis negros con blanco, y los irresponsables me enviaron todos negros, y es una compra internacional... Nunca mas uso a este vendedor"
UA,1,Do not purchase!!! Less than two months and there’s a hole in the toe area. I don’t even wear these full time. I am very disappointed. This is my first pair of under armour and I’m confident I won’t be offering anymore
UA,1,"DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Theres a lot of the reviews near the top that are too good to be true. Almost no one received the color shoe that they requested, getting plain black and white, like I did, even though I requested blue. This was NEVER resolved. Why are you trying to trick people by showing them colorful shoes, and then send them black and whites? Everyone seems to be getting plain black and white. After putting them on I began to realize these are not real Under Armour shoes. The shoes is of HORRIBLE quality. The heel broke down in them already leaving a buldge at the back of the heel when you put them on. They are shredding apart. WORST SHOES EVER. could have gotten the same quality for $10 at the local Walmart. Still pissed off I wasted money on these and never got a response to my complaints."
UA,1,Fell apart in only a few weeks- bottom rubber strips came right off 👎🏻
UA,1,Great at first for running. Worn out already though and I’ve only been walking in them.
UA,1,Had 4 months and sole is coming off.
UA,1,Had to return these shoes that i bought for power walking.  Had a pair a yr ago that fit great but this pair had issues w/ one of the heels being hard-causing it to give me blisters and tear skin on the back of my heel.
UA,1,How in the world I get sent dirty used shoes!!! I’m beyond livid! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
UA,1,I am sure they would be better for ruining and more comfortable if they fit correctly. I normally wear 9.5-10 ordered size 10 and they are too snug to be comfortable
UA,1,"I bought two pairs (black/white and the hot pink) of the previous model and I totally loved them... great running shoes, but these gave me blister on both feet... don’t understand!? Wish I could send them back. I don’t recommend."
UA,1,I got bluster and it was bleeding so bad. I’m not going to use them at all. I wish I had a chance to return them!
UA,1,"I had a very important question about size exchange and keeping the sale price.I cannot summon an answer.
Very dissappointed!!!!"
UA,1,"I loooooove the look of these tennis shoes. They seem comfy, however, I’ve had to exchange twice now due to sizing issues. I’m typically a 6.5, but always go up a half size for tennis shoes. So I ordered a 7. My toe was pushing at the tip. So I exchanged for a 7.5. Somehow, my toe was still touching the tip. Trying an 8 and have my fingers crossed it’ll fit because I love the look of these.

Edit 4/8/21
Editing to add I decided to order an 8 after debating for a few weeks and looking at other tennis shoes. These were on a mini sale, so I went for it. Keep in mind I’m normally a 6.5 in regular shoes, sometimes a 7 in tennis shoes. I had to order an 8 after trying a 7 and a 7.5 and them being too small. The 8 fits my toes BARELY any better. These run ridiculously small. I also feel the 8 looks much more bulky than I remember the others looking. Not sure I’ll be keeping these. Disappointed. Dropping from 3 stars to 1. Sizing is ridiculous."
UA,1,"I love my UA Charged Rogues so, when I saw the specs of the Charged Assert 8 were similar (neutral pronation, high arch, heel strike) yet, claiming to offer more cushioning and a wider toe box and better reviews, I was in!

Since my experience with UA was great with the Rogue, I put on the Assert 8s with my usual socks and headed into work a 12hr shift at the hospital (which I've done with the Rogue, Nike Torch 4, Hoka One One Clifton, and the beloved NurseMates Dove with no issues...I switch up shoes weekly/monthly/quarterly depending on how my feet, legs, and back feel).

HUGE MISTAKE with the Assert 8. Walking from my car to the unit I noticed the heel rubbing on my achilles, no biggie - they're new, I'll bend them and rub out the stiffness...helped moderately. Size was right, width was right...they felt good when I put them on and stood in them checking size. Within the first 4 hours though, the skin along the lateral aspect of my toes (not forefoot - widest part) was on fire and the top of the shoe rubbed my ankle upon dorsiflexion no matter how I adjusted the laces. Around mid-shift the sole of my foot felt like it had splinters in them intermittently. The minor pains were from too much arch support, a common complaint of mine anyway, and utter lack of cushioning compared to the Charged Rogue, even my old Cliftons have better cushion than the Assert 8.

When I got home, I immediately cleaned and assessed my feet. Swollen, red, blistered, a little blood on lateral aspects of pinky toes, and yep -little, firm, black splinters of whatever material makes up the insoles and tongue of this shoe! They felt like fire when I tweezed them out of my heel, midsole, ball, some toe pads and along my ankle near blisters. The insole had pinched the lateral aspects of my toes between it and the body of the shoe each step I took so, the blisters on the big toes were intact and vertical, but the pinky toes were vertically broken skin and had been rubbed to the point of bleeding. Did I need a transfusion, no...but, still a major construction and material flaw that shouldn't have happened.

I was happy to have a couple of days off after these shoes because I did require ibuprofen, ice, rest, and elevation. I also assessed for signs of sustained irritation and/or infection from the splinter sites, gladly there was none.

I'm considering contacting UA to see if they'd like me to send these to them so they can be inspected for authenticity. Otherwise, I'll be putting these in the garbage."
UA,1,I need to return these shoes. One of the loops for the laces is ripped & the laces were laced up so you wouldn’t notice right away there was an issue.
UA,1,I ordered the back sneaker with white sole as shown in picture. I received black on black sneakers 🤬
UA,1,I received the wrong color shoes.
UA,1,I returned the shoes. The left shoe was not make correctly and in a blister. Very pretty I wish I could have worn them.
UA,1,"I tried this shoe on at a store. Found it at Amazon at a better price..ordered it, they were not the same quality that I had tried on at the store.  The shoes I received were a cheap knockoff.."
UA,1,I typically wear a 9.5 and these were extremely tight. Planning to size up one and see how that goes.....
UA,1,"I usually wear a 7.5 so I ordered an 8 because I like to size up in a running shoe. My toes hit the very stiff front of the shoes. Also, the sharp seam across the top scraped my toes. I couldn't imagine anyone running in them, so I didn't bother exchanging. I normally wear Under Armor shoes, but this was a disappointing pair."
UA,1,I was sold a used item for new item price.  Do not want used shoes.
UA,1,I was super sad when I got these shoes and they were all stained up
UA,1,"I wear 11 usually. Ordered a 12, still way too small"
UA,1,I wear a size 8 but these shoes are not true to size I had to order a bigger pair
UA,1,"I will give 4 stars for the actual shoe and fit, etc. However, it looks like they will ship any color combination they want and you get whatever they want to get rid of. This isn't what is in the description. It leads you to believe they are shipping the shoe that is shown. I don't like give 1 star for that reason. But they should tell you what they are actually doing. Just clearing their inventory."
UA,1,"I would never buy another UNDERARMOUR product. I bought a pair of UNDERARMOUR sneakers, but had not worn them in a while. They were in a temperature controlled closet (central air conditioning). I took them out to wear them, and the soles had separated from the sneaker, the glue was messy, and the soles were falling apart. I called UNDERARMOUR and was given an RMA number to send them to UNDERARMOUR. After TWO MONTHS of calling them a few times a week, during which time every customer service rep told me a different story, they finally agreed to give me 40%off a purchase from their website. I was tired of the entire situation, so I agreed. However, I hope someone learns from my mistake in purchasing from them. They do not stand behind their products, and their customer service is awful."
UA,1,I’ve really liked these for the one month I’ve had them but one of the eye loop that the shoe strings go through broke this morning. Not worth it for one month of use.
UA,1,I'm throwing these shoes out after wearing them  just four times.  The left shoe is very uncomfortable -the inside of the shoe is banked high on the left side and therefore it effects your balance.  I'm a big fan of Under Armour products but this was a big disappointment.
UA,1,It’s awful and cheap material. Wont fit feels small. I had to return and never got my money back YET .
UA,1,"I've only had these since February. I absolutely loved them. But, a month ago a very sharp plastic piece is sticking out into my ankle and I cannot cut it off."
UA,1,Just broke them out of the box.  Wore them for about a month. The tread is peeling off the sole. WTH?
UA,1,"Listen to the other reviews!!! I didn’t & I should of. It really does tear up your heels. I wore them on a walk, & within 10 minutes they dug right into the back of my heels & I had to take them off. Otherwise, they are comfortable."
UA,1,"lo compre para hacer ejercicio y me quedaron chicos, no voy a poder usarlos"
UA,1,Mala calidad se dañó en la primera postura
UA,1,Manufacturing defects on the shoes. It doesn’t last long. Only worn for 20 days.
UA,1,Pricey and stiff. I returned them.
UA,1,Product is not true to size. Too heavy and stiff
UA,1,Returned
UA,1,Returned. Too small
UA,1,Runs very small
UA,1,Soles Fell apart not even two months after ordering did not wear. But 2 times a week. Soles did not have hardly any wear to them
UA,1,Super uncomfortable they make the soles of my feet hurt.
UA,1,"Super upset as the picture showed black sneakers with a white sole.....but I received black sneakers with a black sole that absolutely look like service industry sneakers, which is fine if that was what I was trying to purchase, but it wasn’t....and now the price is up from when I purchased them a few days ago..."
UA,1,The colors are mislabeled. The pair I ordered had blue/turquoise on them. The ones I recieved are black and gray/white. They fit but all the ones with blue are labeled black and white and I really want the ones I ordered.
UA,1,"The fit just ok, but within 2 days the bottom of my feet started hurting...like the soles were worn out.  I made the mistake of buying several pair of these Assert 8 tennishoes....thinking they would be like my Assert 7 shoes.  I loved my Assert 7 shoes...they were my favorite; I had like 7 pair!  I made a huge mistake and boy was I wrong!  These Assert 8 are the worse Under Armour shoes I have ever bought. I don't know what Under Armour did when they made these Assert 8's, but they are absolutely horrible.  Every pair I bought hurt the bottom of my feet and just didnt fit correctly...very cheaply made.  Never again...its back to Nike for me.  Stay away from these shoes...they are junk!!"
UA,1,The picture of my sneakers are not what I received. The logo should be white but it is black. Not what I was expecting.
UA,1,"The plastic in the back completely broke apart. My wife has had them less than a year and only wore them for a handful of workouts! For as expensive as these are, they were a disappointment."
UA,1,The shoes came with no laces very disappointed
UA,1,The shoes felt like they were a size too small.
UA,1,"The shoes themself seem like they would be comfy however the pair I received were obviously used. They smelled like sweaty feet, had debris on the bottom, knot in the lace, etc. have to return and find somewhere else."
UA,1,The shoes were just not as comfortable as expected.
UA,1,The shoes were supposed to have turquoise and did not. They are just black and white. Extremely disappointed. The pictures on amazon are deceiving. The shoes are true to size.
UA,1,"the show continually made bruises and sores on the the
of the foot. creating excess bleeding- the cheapest shoes i have ever purchased. do not buy."
UA,1,These are so uncomfortable. Really ridged so not comfortable to bend your foot.
UA,1,These are very high and hard on the back of the ankle and give massive blisters. I tried two different insoles to try and lift my heel up to be able to wear them but they are just horrible shoes and made too tight for insoles.
UA,1,These shoes are not at all what I expected. I am use to under armor high quality and these are a disappointment. My legs and lower back are fatigued and aching after wearing them for 1 hour. It’s sad that I can’t leave a favorable review.
UA,1,"they are lightweight, but runs small. I wear a 9.5 but order a 10 and they are still too small"
UA,1,They felt good but pushed on my Achilles’ tendon a bit. I didn’t think it was that bad until I walked my dog a couple miles and then my Achilles was bleeding. Like with dress shoes. Never has this happened with a sneaker for me.
UA,1,"They look like old lady shoes, they looked cute in the picture, but in person not so much. They feel cheap too"
UA,1,They look like the picture but feel terrible the back of the shoe had a hard part that dug into both my ankles causing them to bleed. Also wore for 2 weeks at planet fitness and feet didnt feel like they had any support
UA,1,Too small and got ripped very fast
UA,1,Too small 😩
UA,1,"Very disappointed in quality of this product.  Purchased them for use in gym, on the bottom there are grip like strips, they’re coming off and make you stumble and trip,  I bought them only 6 months ago and wish there was someone I could reach out to about this.  Not a great shoe and they were not cheap.  They are comfortable and fit true to size, but if you run or workout not a good choice."
UA,1,Very disappointed. One shoe was smaller than the other. Same size. Had no choice but to return.
UA,1,What is pictured is not the shoe I got. The show I got is all black and I wanted black with white Logo and trim.
UA,1,"Wide width is good but the length is DEFIANTLY NOt a size 12, it’s more like an 11.5.  My toe was smashed in the front of the shoe.."
